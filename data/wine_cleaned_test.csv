"This evenly balanced Cabernet has a Bordeaux-like profile, with berry and cassis flavors, nicely integrated oak, and a mild herbal, bell pepper note. Shows good fruit for a 1998 wine and some attractive tobacco and earth shadings. Medium weight, it finishes nicely with moderate tannins and some spice-pepper notes. Drinks well now and may improve over two or three years.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Here is an interesting take on Viognier, relatively low in alcohol (13%) but quite sweet, at almost 2% residual sugar. The sweetness takes away a fair amount of the interesting citrus character of the grape, and seems to dumb it down a bit, but it might fit in well with spicy Asian dishes.",US-Washington:Viognier
"An explosion of gooseberry comes first, followed by layers of creamy apricot fuzz and lemongrass, trailed by Lake County's typical acidity. This has balance and texture.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"A fresh-faced wine, bright with berry fruits, a light layer of tannins and a soft, easy texture. There is some stalkiness but this is great as a delicious, easy wine.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"Aromas of Mediterranean scrub, underbrush, berry, licorice and a balsamic note take shape on this. The aromas carry through to the rounded palate along with juicy cherry, grilled herb, cured meat, clove and a toasted note. Polished tannins provide the framework. It's already accessible and will offer loads of near and midterm pleasure. Drink through 2021.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"A slightly reduced nose signals that this wine needs to breathe. A little time in the glass reveals fresh, ripe flavor that's perfectly suited to summer picnics. It's fruit-forward and uncomplicated, with a light but ripe body.",Austria-Burgenland:Zweigelt
"The Lapa vineyards are away from the Tagus (Tejo) river giving better structured soil and therefore firmer wines. That shows in this ripe wine with its tannins and bold fruits. It is attractively fruity, with a dry core. The wine is ready to drink.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese Red
"Ripe flavors and full body give this wine plenty of impact, its thick layer of fine tannins holding together ripe plum and black cherry fruit. It has good concentration to match its grippy, tannic mouthfeel, so it's a good candidate for further aging. Best from 2020.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"With a toasty character, this is a classic of its kind, with ripe fruit and an attractive slice of lemon. A mineral edge to this spicy wine gives a fresh texture at the end. It should age a few months, so drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This is the first vintage of this wine to be labeled as a Cabernet Sauvignon as opposed to a red wine. It brings aromas of fresh jalapeño, herb and cherry. The cherry and plum flavors are rich and layered, backed by tightly coiled tannins.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"With some firm structure, this wine also has great fruitiness. It offers plenty of raspberry fruits, good acidity and a solid texture of tannins. The acidity keeps the wine perfumed and fresh. Drink the wine from 2019.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Gritty, gaseous aromas are demanding. This SB offers up a citric, pulpy body and slightly bitter flavors of passion fruit, orange and tangerine. Citrus pith and related bitterness blend with citric acidity on the finish, but this wine is starting to fade.",Chile-Leyda Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"A blend of several vineyards in the famous Middle Reach stretch of the warmer, northwestern arm of the Russian River Valley, this is a beautiful wine to drink now. It's dry and silky, with perfectly ripened raspberry, cherry, strawberry and cola flavors, brightened by crisp acidity. It will hold in the bottle through 2020.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is a gorgeous rendering of grape and place. Steely at first, it shows off the coolness of the site, yet it's thick and inviting in apple skin, lemon bar and fresh-picked papaya. Minerality-driven, it never taxes the palate, instead releasing quiet waves of flavor and acidity.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Toast, buttercup and baked apple aromas give it some richness and sweetness to start, and the palate is creamy but well balanced, with toasty apple, peach and vanilla flavors. Solid and creamy on the finish, with tropical afterburners. Drink soon before it fades.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Chardonnay
"This ambitious effort stars flavors so ripe and fantastic, they defy description. The wine, with a few drops of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, explodes in blackberries, black cherries, currants, mocha, sweet licorice, plum and new oak flavors. The tannins are magnificent, the oak integration beautiful. The chief criticism is that the alcohol level is high, and gives the wine a burn of heat.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Briny, powdery white-fruit aromas are offset by vanilla cookie notes and a hint of bath soap. This feels foamy and chunky, while lemon-lime and melon flavors finish bland but inoffensive.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"This wine's barrel spice, barnyard, coffee and vanilla aromas lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors tinged with a strong, distracting gamy note.",US-Washington:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Some wineries releasing a new Garys' Syrah would charge a lot more, but Novy keeps their prices moderate. While this wine is enormously tannic and dry, it shows a complex range of blackberry and stone fruit, tobacco, currant, charred meat bone, black pepper and mineral flavors, with the oak influence evident but subtle. Given the extreme dryness and tannins, as well as significant alcohol, the question is will the wine age. It doesn't seem likely to, so decant and drink up through 2020.",US-California:Syrah
"Part of a series of sparkling wines from Piera Martellozzo, this is a blend of Raboso and Pinot Nero. In fact, the wine's bright pink color comes from the former varietal and its delicate floral bouquet from the latter.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sparkling Blend
"T-L has three cuvées of Châteauneuf, and while this is the least expensive, it's also the most enjoyable now. A hint of sweaty horse blanket may put off some tasters, but this full-bodied, lushly textured wine features ample raspberry and cherry flavors, copious spices and a long, softly dusty finish. Drink it over the next 5–8 years.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Earthy, foresty aromas of plum and dark berry fruits show a touch of wet animal fur. This is sturdy and fairly full in build, with leafy flavors of plum, pepper, chocolate and toast. Mild green notes of mint and herbs accent a spicy finish,",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Carmenère
"Labeled reserve, this young wine has a bit more heft than the Willamette Valley bottling. Black cherry, cola and Dr. Pepper flavors wrap into an earthy, chalky, tannic finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Ripe and creamy in texture, this is a pear and peach flavored wine. A touch of butteriness gives a rounded texture and a hint of vanilla. Drink this fruity wine from 2015.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Smoky, fruity and spicy in equal measure, this wine is 57% Cabernet Sauvignon-based, with 15% Merlot, 14% Cabernet Franc and 14% Malbec. With balanced acidity and an integrated use of oak, it offers structure and length beyond its crisp cassis, raspberry and blackberry notes.",US-California:Meritage
"Juicy and polished, this opens with aromas that recall ripe plum, dark berry, mocha, Asian spice and a hint of menthol. The full-bodied palate doles out ripe black cherry, chopped mint, anise and a hint of tobacco alongside velvety tannins that lend finesse and structure. Drink through 2021.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Herbal to the max, with can't-miss aromas of juniper, pine and foresty berry. The palate is big and syrupy in feel, with herbal flavors of olive, carob and tobacco. Sweet and leafy on the finish.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Red Blend
"This estate-grown, single-vineyard, 100% varietal bottling is smooth, rich and forward. Scents of baking spices, caramel and toast introduce a full and lengthy palate loaded with black cherry and cassis fruit. A steely firmness to the wine anticipates further development in the bottle.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Pure Touriga Nacional, with eight months in barrel, this is a fruit and dark chocolate-flavored wine. It has a firm character and a touch of bitter extraction that is in the process of blowing away to give richness. At its base, this is a concentrated wine with a solid, dark structure and perfumed berry fruits. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Tejo:Touriga Nacional
"Just a small amount of this wine was made, blended with 7% Zinfandel and 5% Syrah. Dark juicy fruit finds a way to succeed on the bold big-boned palate as notes of licorice and leather add savory undertones to the softly tannic madness.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"A liquid tribute to old Mendocino, this wine is a blend of mostly Zinfandel and Petite Sirah, with smaller proportions of Sangiovese, Carignane, Negromaro, Barbera, Nebbiolo and Syrah. Medium bodied with spicy black pepper, leather and stewed plum flavors, it would go perfectly well with burgers or pizza.",US-California:Red Blend
"This is a full-bodied and rich wine with touches of vanilla and toast from wood aging that are integrated into flavors of ripe apricot, lime and herbs. Drink now, and until 2019.",France-Provence:White Blend
"Black plum, dark kitchen spice, leather and pressed violet aromas lead the nose on this round, savory wine. On the velvety palate, firm, polished tannins frame mature black cherry, licorice and a hint of chewing tobacco. Drink through 2018.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This wine has more body and a richer mouthfeel than many of its peers, with mild floral and almond flavors and a touch of butterscotch.",US-California:Pinot Grigio
"This wine has tight fruit, crisp cherry flavors and acidity. The structure comes from the fruit skins rather than tannins. It is ready to drink.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"The flint and chalk nature of the soil shows in this wine. From old vines well situated in the Premier Cru of Montmains, it has concentration and a tight, young texture that will need to develop. It is fresh and full of citrus now, although a riper, creamy character will be coming through as it matures. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"How do you make a Riesling this good and sell it for seven bucks? Juicy and fruity, it's absolutely loaded with citrus and stone fruit flavors, but offers supporting acidity, good length, and a touch of minerality.",US-Washington:Riesling
"This single-vineyard Sangiovese is aged 30 months in neutral oak. Sweet tomato and wild strawberry fruit carries notes of ground oregano. Despite the high alcohol, it doesn't finish with any heat, just a hint of dark chocolate.",US-Washington:Sangiovese
"Exceptionally ripe, this has notes of tropical fruits, apricots and pears, with a glorious coating of sweet, smoky, buttered toast from the oak. It's pretty obvious in its appeal, and it will be enjoyed by many for its vast richness.",US-California:Chardonnay
"The pretty fragrance comes with cotton candy highlights, along with a note of tangy red fruit. It's concentrated and deep, with appealing purity of flavor and the structure to age for over a decade.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Milla Handley is attempting to make an Alsatian-style wine that is indeed austere, with an almost almond-butter and earthy, mushroom nose that's well balanced between acidity and tropical sweetness and finishes smooth. A suggested pairing with sushi is right on.",US-California:Riesling
"This thin wine has very little going for it. It has watered-down berry flavors, but on the plus side, it's dry and vital in acidity.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"From Jaboulet's own holdings, this is a broad, mouthcoating expression of Condrieu, with pineapple, apricot and honey notes that blossom slowly given enough time in the glass. Drink now–2015.",France-Rhône Valley:Viognier
"Spicy and sweet, this Zin, from century-old vines, has quintessential varietal flavors of wild red and black berries, chocolate, thyme, cedar and pepper. Drink now for its youthful charm.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Le Poesie is an elegant and subdued wine that is characterized by refined, but never exaggerated, aromas of dried apricot, honey, marzipan, peach cobbler and fine touches of dried sage and lemon zest. The acidity is impressive and really helps in washing the palate of the wine's delicious residual sugar.",Italy-Veneto:Garganega
"Here's an elegant and fine Barbaresco with silky tannins and drying touches of talc powder and exotic spice. An austere quality shows on the nose, with smoked bacon, tobacco and black currant aromas. It displays beautiful intensity as well.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
Jammy aromas and equally ripe sweet fruit flavors give this wine a candied character. It's full-bodied and feels a little warm on the finish.,US-California:Pinot Noir
"Soft, fruity, dry and hot, with jammy cherry and raspberry flavors, touched with smoky oak. If you like this high alcohol style, the wine is for you.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This superrich wine, with 12.7% residual sugar, is very sweet. It dazzles with honeyed flavors of tangerines and Asian pears, with creamy notes of vanilla bean and smoky pie crust. Could be denser and more concentrated, but it's a flashy dessert wine.",US-California:Gewürztraminer
"Earns its stripes for the sheer power of raspberry and cherry fruit that defines its California ripeness. Firm tannins and acidity fortunately provide balance, and the wine finishes dry. An opulent, extravagent Pinot Noir that will provide lusty drinking over the next six years.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Napa-based Elyse is better known for their Cabernet Sauvignon, but they have reached into Nevada County, in the Sierra Foothills, for this lovely Rhône-style blend. It's soft in acidity and the tannins are melted, as you might expect from a warm-to-hot region. But the flavors are plush in jammy cherries, black raspberries, chocolate and crushed black pepper.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Savory pepper and rustic gravel aromas meet with strawberry and dried cherry on the nose of this proprietary red blend that is widely available. Strawberry pie flavors dominate the sip, but there's also a lava rock minerality and a burst of acidity.",US-California:Red Blend
"This is a straightforward and pleasant Barbera exhibiting ripe dark-fruit flavors, spice and fresh acidity. Cries out for food, and will pair beautifully with soups, pastas and white meats. Grape Expectations and Massanois Imports.",Italy-Piedmont:Barbera
"Deeply funky aromas of salted rhubarb and beets, grilled meats, anise and hot tar greet the nose on this fascinating Pinot Noir. Sanguine, bloody flavors evolve down a line of licorice and slate toward raspberry, with a bit of grilled meat at the very end.",US-California:Pinot Noir
The nose is very shy: The wines still needs waking up and only comes alive slowly with a little air. The flavors on the palate seem subdued but there is customary Riesling freshness. The finish is dry.,France-Alsace:Riesling
"Apple and pine aromas are attractive. This wine feels round, with just enough citrusy acidity to offset an oily quality. Generous citrus, melon and stone-fruit flavors finish clean and solid.",Spain-Northern Spain:Verdejo
"High alcohol gives this blend chili pepper heat behind the black cherries, mocha and currants. It's a robust, heady wine that wants rich stews and roasts to pair with.",US-California:Red Blend
"Not all Clos Vougeot lives up to its billing, but this wine certainly does. With its superbly ripe fruit, a harmonious balance between fruit, tannins and acidity, and a full, generous texture, this is a wine to savor. It is a big wine in all senses, except that it has a great sense of proportion. Enjoy this wine in 2–3 years, or age for 10.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"This opens with aromas of stewed plum, cherry marinated in spirits, cellar floor and a hint of soy sauce. The aromas carry over to the dense palate along with licorice and a hint of orange peel.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Heavy aromas of oak, char and syrupy berry fruits don't smell entirely natural. This feels tannic and scratchy, with missing parts. The flavor of candied, sweet, dominating oak is front and center, while mint, carob and stewed berry flavors finish this off.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Red Blend
"Made with 98% Sangiovese and 2% Ancellotta, this has aromas of black-skinned berry, baking spice and a whiff of new leather. The concentrated palate delivers blackberry jam, toasted oak, roasted coffee bean and a hint of licorice framed in fine-grained tannins. You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol. Enjoy through 2021.",Italy-Central Italy:Sangiovese
"This wine is a blend of equal parts Grenache Blanc and Marsanne. The aromas are quite restrained, with intriguing notes of pear, almond, citrus, cream and spice. The palate brings a similar sense of restraint, showing no apparent new oak influence. It doesn't quite all come together but it provides a sense of intrigue.",US-Washington:White Blend
Organic and biodynamic Punset offers Nebbiolo-based wines that are very difficult to assess. Try them too young (as in this case) and the wines often lack clarity and balance. Wait ten years or more and they blossom into something very special indeed. The 2008 Campo Quadro illustrates this point exactly.,Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"A perfectly solid Garnacha with pepper, bright red fruit and a touch of country style to the bouquet despite its pedestrian price. The palate is bright and tastes of plum and red berry, while the feel is good and the finish fruity and lively. What inexpensive red wine should be.",Spain-Northern Spain:Garnacha
"Rubbery, sweaty, muted aromas lead to a dilute, fizzy palate. Prickly green citrus and melon flavors end on the vegetal side.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño
"This is the estate vineyard, and really shines in this excellent vintage. Flavors of strawberry pastry filling come up just short of jammy, while the aging for 18+ months in new and neutral oak brings accents of toast and vanilla. It has the stuffing to age nicely over the next six to eight years.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"A blend of 95% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Petit Verdot, this soft, approachable wine from a storied producer is meant to enjoy young and yet exudes plenty of complexity. Luscious aromas of graham cracker and blueberry jam belie a classically balanced measure of integrated tannins and dark chocolate. Drink now through 2020.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Made in a more popular style than Calera's Mt. Harlan bottling, this Chard features lush flavors of pineapple and orange jam, honey and vanilla. The acidity is bright and mouthwatering.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Pure Merlot, with muscle and sharp tannins. The scent suggests butter and caramel, but the wine itself has more herb and earth flavor than barrel or grape.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Honey, almond blossom and citrus zest are followed by creamy foam and tonic acidity. This is an easygoing Prosecco that offers a light and compact structure and bright flavors of lime and green fruit.",Italy-Veneto:Prosecco
"Light and lean on entry, this wine builds up steam and power as it develops in the glass, becoming a robust exploration of rhubarb and cranberry. The texture on the palate is velvety and moderately rich, dotted in sultry spice.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Its soft, beguiling aromas of brown sugar, cinnamon, pie crust and cranberries pull you in, then bright cherry flavors take over on the palate. Mouthfeel is light, yet caressing, and the flavors fan out on the finish, picking up notes of spice and cola. A pretty wine from start to finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Pinot Noir
"A soft, perfumed wine, it shows attractive light black currant flavors as well as some tannins, acidity and a young fruity character. It is ready to drink now.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

Bortolotti makes a well-priced Non-DOC Prosecco Extra Dry with fragrant aromas of white flowers and peach. The luminous sparkler has just enough sweetness to underscore those fresh peach flavors and offers tingly bubbling.,Italy-Veneto:Prosecco
"This is a rocking price for the quality of the wine, a small-production crafting of well-grown grapes in a great year. Light on the oak imprint, it shines instead in sweet and sour stone fruit, most vibrantly apricot, with a soft and layered silkiness to the texture.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Balanced and rich with apple flavors, this is tightly textured, cut with lemon zest and full of fruit. Although aged for six years, it is still so fresh and crisp, with a bright, lively aftertaste only just hinting at some toast.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Dark, dense and ripe from the start, this New World-style Cab Franc is showing raisin, vanilla and foresty aromas prior to a lush soft palate. Flavors of raisin, chocolate and blackberry are on the cusp of overripe and desiccated, while this finishes with flavors of licorice, peppercorn, beef jerky and chocolate. Drink this bulky soft-bodied red now through 2018.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Franc
"On the wonderfully plump, dense and floral nose, this wine shows blackberry jam, black cherry, allspice, wet river stones and lilac aromas. The palate packs plenty of earthy tones, from juniper and asphalt to eucalyptus and black pepper, proving quite complex and layered.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Difficult to find much to like here. Smells baked and Porty, and tastes overtly sweet in residual sugar, like cherry and raspberry jam.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of black cherry, tobacco and exotic spice lead the nose of this wine. The palate is soft and ripe, with black cherry, prune and white pepper accents. A bit simple, but delicious, and ready to drink now.",Italy-Veneto:Red Blend
"The ripe 65% of Sémillon is the secret behind this rich wine. While at the young stage it has a herbal character that is going to fill out impressively to give a creamy wine with a touch of vanilla and fine crisp, juicy acidity. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Youthful, bright red color on this full-bodied, potentially rich wine. With its balance between acidity, black fruits and edgy tannins, the wine from the plateau close to Saumur has all the smoky, tobacco leaf and fragrance of cool climate Cabernet Franc.",France-Loire Valley:Cabernet Franc
"Dark, full and very oaky on the nose, this extracted Malbec is ripe and toasty smelling. Tannic, stacked and chewy in the mouth, with flavors of roasted blackberry, raw oak, chocolate and clove, this finishes with a ton of unabsorbed oak and related flavors of clove and mint.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"One of a growing number of micro-boutiques in Oregon, Vidon made its first wine in 2003. Subsequent vintages were quickly sold out, with quantities as low as two barrels of individual wines. This 2007 is in better supply, and well worth seeking out. Fragrant with sweet strawberries, hints of fresh herb, a Dr. Pepper soda streak particular to Oregon and nicely laid-in oak, it's a seductive and focused effort that masks its high alcohol effectively.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Dense up front, with earthy notes to go with aromas of cola, ripe berry, coconut, almond candy and toast. Features a well-oaked personality and full flavors of ripe black plum, blackberry, fine herbs and integrated spice. Long and lasting on the finish, like a good cigar. Mature, but with lots of life left; drink now through 2018.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"Plummy yet cool, with a greenish, floral note that adds lift and interest to the dark-fruit aromas and flavors. This is a bit austere and dusty, but long on the finish, so drink 2018–2030.",New Zealand-Martinborough:Pinot Noir
"Here's a pristine and tonic Pinot Grigio from northern Italy presented in equally clean packaging. The wine delivers a crystalline appearance that is accented by measured aromas of citrus, light peach and white flower.",Italy-Veneto:Pinot Grigio
Ripe stone fruit dominates the appetizing nose. The palate also shines with generous yellow plum ripeness that is nonetheless tempered by zesty lime peel flavours and a deeply savory yeast note. This packs quite a little punch.,Austria-Kremstal:Grüner Veltliner
"Aromas of black currant, plum cake, vanilla and mocha lead the nose on this structured, full-bodied wine. On the palate, notes of cinnamon, black pepper and nutmeg add depth to the rich blackberry and crushed plum flavors, Despite the hefty structure, it's also surprisingly elegant thanks to assertive but polished tannins and just enough fresh acidity.",Italy-Veneto:Red Blend
"Full-bodied and refined, this offers aromas of mature plum, vanilla, exotic spice and French oak. The firm palate delivers dried cherry, black raspberry, chopped herb, licorice, ground pepper and mineral alongside tightly knit, fine-grained tannins. It's an impressive effort for this scorching vintage. Let the tannins unwind for another few years then enjoy sooner rather than later.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This rich, creamy, juicy wine is full of strawberry fruits and ripe tannins. It has weight and density as well as powerful structure. A fresh black-cherry character comes through, giving acidity and a perfumed aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Delicate and retrained in aroma, this wine hails from an extreme coastal vineyard between Pismo Beach and the Edna Valley. With patience, Meyer lemon curd and scratched-lime elements emerge, and the flavors are also light, with more lemon and lime as well as Gala apple and Anjou pear flesh.",US-California:Chardonnay
"The wine is called “summer pleasure” and its fruitiness and crisp texture seem well-suited. Red cherries, strawberries and a fine line of acidity set the scene for this soft fruity wine. Drink now.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Delicately scented, this offers aromas of apple, candied citrus peel and a hint of pressed yellow flower. The palate offers Kaiser pear, lemon drop and toasted almond alongside bright acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Friulano
"Juicy, nearly sweet-smelling aromas of blackberry pie introduce this wine by master sommelier Paolo Barbieri, who moved from Las Vegas to become a winemaker in the Santa Ynez Valley a few years ago. The flavors are streamlined and fruit-forward with dark purple and red berries, as well as root beer and cola notes.",US-California:Syrah
"A blend of Arinto and Fernão Pires, this is very aromatic, full of citrus flavors, crisp and clean. Light, refreshing, quaffing wine. Screwcap.",Portugal-Lisboa:Portuguese White
"A perfumed wine, this has light tannins and fresh berry fruits. It is ripe with a fragrant floral character that's enhanced by the acidity and pure cherry flavors. The wine can be drunk now, but will be better from 2017.",France-Loire Valley:Pinot Noir
"Tastes like sweet, spicy blackberry jam, with an overripe note of prune lurking in the background, which will limit the wine's age-­worthiness. It's fine in tannins and acids, with plenty of elegance, but it seems too sweet for true classic Stags Leap character.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Tangy in nature, this wine has heaps of ripe red fruit, cola, Moroccan spices and orange peel, with licorice root and tart cranberry woven into an elegant palate. There's power and ageability to this Marlborough Pinot, but it's also begging to be enjoyed with a tagine. Drink now–2024.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Pinot Noir
"This spicy and forward wine offers firm blackberry and black cherry fruit accented with savory olive flavors. Its vanilla and baking spices notes suggest some time in new wood, and a hint of Dr. Pepper comes through on the finish. Syrah is definitely a strength at this winery.",US-Oregon:Syrah
"This pure varietal wine exhibits good Viognier character, with plenty of interesting botanical highlights in nose and mouth. Citrus flavors dominate, with a medium-weight midpalate and moderately long finish.",US-Oregon:Viognier
"The Alicante Bouschet and Castelão in the blend give it its rich, immediately fruity character and dense color. Structure and concentration leave room for an elegant texture. Blackberry juiciness shines at the end. Drink now.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese Red
"Earthy and perfumed berry aromas get this off to a good start. The palate is chewy and medium in size, with straightforward blackberry flavors backed by a blast of coffee. The finish dries out quickly, leaving a peppery aftertaste.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Shows lots of class and finesse for a Sonoma Coast Pinot that's under $20. It's fully dry and zesty in acidity, with rich tannins framing cherry, pomegranate, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors. A great starter Pinot if you're just getting into the variety. Production was 3,576 cases.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"After initial scents of smoke and dark toast subside, the Ben's Blend reveals a prettier, daintier profile with vibrant red-cherry and plum notes laced with hints of cedar and purple flower. The palate is dense with flavors of blackberry and bramble, balanced by brisk acidity and ripe, mouth-coating tannins. Decant to drink now or save for another five years.",US-New York:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A bit thin on the nose, this has buttery apple juice aromas. The acidity is a bit off, both tart and mixed with vanilla creaminess, and the flavors are slight with apple candy and tart lemon.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This is stalky smelling, with modest fruit and a burnt field aroma. It looks and tastes weak and transparent, with sourness rising up on the palate along with notes of citrus, cranberry and cherry pie.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Red Blend
"Using dry-farmed grapes, Ryan Pease crafts a heavily structured wine with aromas of black gravel, mocha and blueberries reduced in a vanilla vinaigrette. The sticky tannins will need some time to unravel, but the flavors of cooked cherries, blackberries and coffee paste are promising. Drink 2018–2024.",US-California:Mourvèdre
"Wood spice, vanilla and dark-fruit aromas are followed by tart game and red-fruit flavors. The wood seems very primary.",US-Washington:Tempranillo
"Quince, lemon peel and honeydew make for compatible bedfellows in this no-oak white, which is light and inviting on the palate, with more underlying herbal flourishes than it first lets on. Dry and daring, it'll pair well with all manner of fresh seafood.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"An opulent style, where the tannins are subservient to the ripeness of the red cherry flavor. The acidity enhances the sweetness of the rich fruit, and the lively, vibrant texture comes sweeping right through to finish.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Soft, fruity and off dry, this is a typically fresh and light-hearted Vinho Verde. Attractive apple and lemon flavors shine through the lightly prickly texture. Drink immediately.",Portugal-Vinho Verde:Portuguese White
"Aromas of prune, red berry, graphite and mint lead the nose. The palate delivers raw red cherry, black pepper, anise and sage alongside bright acidity and compact tannins.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Briny stone fruit aromas lead to a pulpy palate in this medium-bodied wine. Its ripe white fruit flavors show no signs of oak, tasting melony and finishing short. Drink as soon as possible for best results.",Spain-Northern Spain:Chardonnay
"A nice salmon color, this subtle kitchen-sink pink blend of 77% Grenache, 8% Mission, 4% Petite Sirah, 4% Syrah, 4% Zinfandel, 1% Cabernet Sauvignon, 1% Merlot and 1% Petit Verdot offers clove, raspberry and light plum on the nose. The palate offers more raspberry, a touch of bubblegum and a concrete-driven mineral tension that makes for excellent texture.",US-California:Grenache
"This thick, extracted wine is made from 70% Pallagrello and 30% Casavecchia grapes, a portion of which was overripened on the vine. It opens with aromas of leafy underbrush, oak, toast, prune and vanilla. The lumbering, monolithic palate is sugary-sweet, offering vanilla extract, toasted oak and sugar plum.",Italy-Southern Italy:Red Blend
"Tart cherry aromas and flavors with tarragon accents are wrapped in oak in this medium-weight, mature red. The wine is evenly textured, but the oak sits well to the fore, really predominating on the very dry, tangy-in-a-woody-way finish. —M.M.",Spain-Central Spain:Red Blend
"Fruity is the best way to describe this young wine that shows touches of weight and darkness but mostly simple, fresh, lightly candied berry aromas and flavors. There's crispness and intensity to the palate, while the finish is clean.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"This fragrant Falanghina shows bright aromas of white flower, jasmine and honeysuckle. Very subtle tones of banana and pineapple fill in the back and give the wine momentum and depth on the finish.",Italy-Southern Italy:Falanghina
"A ripe full-bodied wine that is a blend of Arinto and Fernão Pires. It misses out on the normal freshness of both grapes, giving instead rich yellow fruits and perfumed spice. There is some acidity, although not enough.",Portugal-Lisboa:Portuguese White
"Bright fruit tones of peach, melon and Golden Delicious apple sit with the soft, creamy perlage. Overall, there's a feminine, delicate quality to this sparkler.",Italy-Veneto:Glera
"Blended from Yarra Valley and King Valley fruit, this light-bodied Pinot Noir is silky in texture, with a lingering finish. Modest red fruit combines with earthier notes of parsnip. Drink now.",Australia-Victoria:Pinot Noir
"Complex aromas of honeysuckle, whipped butter, poached pear, baked white peach, sea salt and crushed rocks find their way into this rich, layered and yet zesty wine by Brian Loring. Ripe Gala apples meet with sea salt and slate on the palate that shows a lot of ocean influence. A slow sizzle of acidity presents more flavors of toast, vanilla and clove.",US-California:Chardonnay
Crisp and brightfresh acidity and ethereal aromas of rosemary and dried basil. The nose is pungent.,Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Delicious and refreshing, it opens with a delicate fragrance of white spring flowers, chamomile and apples. The juicy, linear palate delivers ripe Bartlett pear, tart Granny Smith, white peach and mineral alongside crisp acidity that leaves a clean, lingering finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Bianco
"Crisp and clean lines of tart apricot, nectarine, Gala apple and honeysuckle ride a steely frame that characterizes the nose of this wine. Minerality shows first on the sip, but then the wine becomes ripe with apple, pear and peach flavors. A green-apple-rind tartness arises on the finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This is a vibrantly energetic wine, explosive in raspberry and cherry, with a weedy, herbal undertone that gives it intrigue. Concentrated on the midpalate, with well-ingrained tannins, it finishes in a highlight of toasted oak.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Oily and almondy on the nose, but also layered and stacked. Feels lively, jumpy and pumped full of acidity, then tastes of classic lychee and green melon. Full and driving, with citrusy zest to the tail end.",Argentina-Other:Torrontés
"This wine holds the tension between sweetness and fresh apple acidity well. Crisp, light and fruity, it's a great apéritif wine, ready to drink.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Untamed plum and cherry aromas are a bit strained. This everyday Garnacha is fresh and fruity in feel, with good but standard plum and cherry flavors. An edgy grating finish with a spot of oak character wraps this up.",Spain-Northern Spain:Garnacha
"Lush black-fruit and marzipan aromas show notes of tobacco, cedar and leather. This is a ripe, layered Malbec with serious depth and balance as well. Intense currant and berry flavors are spicy and finish with muscular framework and length. Drink through 2019.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"This is a very new-wood dominated wine, that will appeal to lovers of California Cabernet. Blackcurrant jelly fruits are there as well, very modern, very polished. It is a fine wine, but maybe not Bordeaux.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A 50-50 blend of Inzolia and Viognier, this feels slender and tight on the palate, with a drying note of talcum powder behind the flavors of citrus, honeysuckle and stone fruit.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:White Blend
"About as good as it gets in terms of a powerful, fully oaked modern wine that still guards its core identity while offering plenty of straightforward drinking pleasure. San Roman in 2004 is a high-speed train with agile fruit and bracing acidity more dominating than, say, tannic might or alcoholic heat. Among the brave new world of modern wines from Toro this is one of the very best. 6,500 cases produced.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tinta de Toro
"Clos du Val has gone as far as they intend to in order to make a ripe, opulent Cab in the modern Napa cult style. But they remain faithful to their Bordeaux-inspired house style, which is leaner and more tannic than most. The result is a natural cellar candidate, with an official alcohol of only 13.5%. Rich in blackberries and black currants, this wine should easily develop over the next 10–15 years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a great example of the power that can come a Grand Cru vineyard. It's opulent and dense, but more than that it has intense energy and drive. Although the wine is marked as medium sweet, the spice and pepper give it a dry, tight, nervy edge. The wine is still young and will be best from 2017.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"There's a complex and gamy profile on the nose of this blend of 51% Grenache, 22% Syrah, 20% Petite Sirah and 7% Viognier, with dried meat and olallieberry fruit scents. The palate shows raw beef, sour plum and crushed thyme flavors.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Full and ripe, this is a rich wine. Its tannins are well cushioned by the ripe black fruits and generous texture. Fruity with balanced acidity, the wine is spicy and with an open aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"This wine starts out quite reductive, while also showing aromas of black olive, herbs and chocolate. It's full bodied in feel with abundant dark fruit flavors that show persistence. There are good things here but the aromas and flavors seem disconnected.",US-Washington:Syrah
"A robust blend of 38% Zinfandel, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Petite Sirah, 11% Barbera and 11% Syrah, all grown in Lake County, this rightly named Non Typical red is rich in strawberry and raspberry flavors with dusty overtones. Structured, but soft in the mouth, with a caramel finish.",US-California:Red Blend
"Elderberry, white pepper, leather, asphalt and black olive show on the nose of this blend of all five Bordeaux varieties done in the region's savory style. The flavors are mellow overall, with wildfire smoke and a bit of herbaceousness decorating the elderberry and graphite core.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is strongly marked by toasty, cedary oak, but enough fruit comes through on the midpalate and finish to suggest this is more than just another oaky red. It's rich and creamy through the midpalate, then finishes long, with mixed berry notes emerging at the end.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Old vines on a single parcel provide the base of this fresh-faced wine. It has an attractive herbaceous and green-fruit character that's laced with a grapefruit note. This has exceptional depth of flavor, and the aftertaste is more steely and flinty.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"A blend of Cabernet and Syrah, the wine is dry and bitter, with a grapeskin astringency to the currant, blackberry and tangerine flavors. It wisely holds back on the alcohol and excessive fruitiness that can mar Paso Robles reds. But that astringency lowers the score.",US-California:Red Blend
"Comes down on the hard, rough side of the Petite Sirah spectrum, with jagged tannins and dry flavors of cola, green mint, blackberries, bacon and black pepper that turn bitter toward the finish.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"A hint of buttered popcorn sits atop scents of ripe yellow apple, peach and lemon custard on the nose of this wine. Those notes continue through to the plush palate, with threads of toasted brioche and sweet spice weaving throughout. There's ample acidic cut to the mouthfeel, lending balance and freshness that lasts through the finish. Drink now–2019.",South Africa-Robertson:Chardonnay
"This opens with aromas of scorched earth, cured meat, underbrush and ripe blackberry. The evolved palate offers coffee, mocha, vanilla, raisin and blackberry extract alongside close-grained tannins. Enjoy sooner rather than later.",Italy-Veneto:Red Blend
"This wine is rich, full of ripe red berry fruits and sliced with firm, still-young tannins. Produced from old vines, it has concentration and juicy acidity that lifts the full, fruity character. The structure will allow the wine to age further, so drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley:Cabernet Franc
"Fonseca uses its Guimaraens brand in years when there is no general vintage declaration. Even so, the wine has all the broad, ripe and generous character that is so typical of Fonseca. It is packed with rich black fruits that are enveloped by the structured tannins and never-too-sweet character. It obviously needs to age; drink from 2025.",Portugal-Port:Port
"While fresh pink grapefruit and Meyer lemon notes shine brightly on the nose and palate of this off-dry Riesling, there's a touch of savory allium that distracts. It's a juicy easygoing wine with approachably soft, sunny acidity. Drink now.",Germany-Rheinhessen:Riesling
"Scents of rapberry, cherry and earth make for a nice begining and lead into some attractive pepperiness on the palate but the finish drops off quickly. The wine's refreshing acidity will pair nicely with spare ribs.",Australia-Australia Other:Shiraz
"The subdued nose eventually reveals black cherry, anise and a whiff of chopped herb that carry over to the straightforward, informal palate. Dusty, drying tannins and a note of bitter sage leave an astringent finish.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nero d'Avola
"Tough and gritty, with hard tannins, this is definitely astringent and dry, but it does show classic Napa character. Blended with Cabernet Franc and Merlot, it's rich in blackberry, black cherry, currant and dark chocolate flavors that finish long. It would be a mistake to drink this wine too young. Cellar it until 2018, and it should provide mature beauty well beyond.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Pure, poised citrus lift combines pink and yellow grapefruit peel on the nose, with more cushioning on the textured, concentrated palate. A stony, mineral background plays against the lively, bright acid that leaves you wanting more.",Austria-Kamptal:Riesling
"The aroma is stalky and leathery on the nose. The palate is grabby, with sulfuric, bitter flavors of uncomplicated berry fruits. This is 65% Bobal and 35% Tempranillo.",Spain-Levante:Red Blend
"Very little stands out on the bouquet other than a whiff of oak and applesauce. This feels juicy and acidic, thus fresh, while flavors of apple and citrus feed into a citrusy finish with a touch of oak.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Chardonnay
"This single-vineyard Pinot Noir shows fine coastal acidity and dryness, and a transparency of taste that comes from the terroir. It's very delicious, with jammy raspberry and cherry fruit flavors enriched with oaky vanillins and smoky, buttery caramel. Gorgeous and compelling, combining power and nuance, it's a wine to drink now and through 2015, at least.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is a subtle red wine whose tannins gingerly coat the midpalate and linger. Full of red fruit flavors and balanced by an herb note, this is softly textured and round.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Shaped by the capturing of a cool-climate site and philosophy, this wine is stemmy and balanced, offering a treasure's trove of fresh earth, black tea and clove, all within a lushly layered mouthfeel. The ripeness of the fruit and acidity are entirely complementary.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Leather, berry, toast, crushed rose and herbs are some of the scents that emerge. The palate displays crushed cherry, black pepper, licorice and balsamic notes alongside youthfully aggressive, tightly packed tannins that need another few years to unwind.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Similar to the 2010 Primus, this is earthy, wholesome and soundly built. Aromas of meaty fruit, leather and licorice are earthy and inviting. The palate feels chewy and medium to full, with dark plum, carob, loam and blackberry flavors. A warm, mildly baked finish concludes this round, very nice red.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Carmenère
"Intense and dark, with an oily nose of mineral, leather and mocha along with ripe berry fruit notes. The blend (50% Carmenère, 40% Cab Sauvignon, 10% Syrah), works like a charm. The flavors settle on lightly herb-infused berry flavors and chocolate, while the finish is on the spot. Rich, ripe and with modest tannins; drink now–2009.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Red Blend

"This 57-43 blend piquantly shows off the varietal characters of both grape varieties in its combination of citrus and pepper notes. It's like a collision of lime and jalapeño, but the wine's modest intensity makes it more of a fender-bender than an ambulance call, and the finish fades a little too quickly.",Australia-Western Australia:Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon
"A rusty cherry and earthy forest-floor quality marks the energetic nose of this bottling, along with graphite and touches of chocolate and coffee. The sip boasts great verve, showing flavors of tart raspberry and well-integrated thyme, rosemary and pine-needle herbaceousness.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"New wood aromas are still strongly evident in this young and fruity wine. It has ripe tannins, a juicy character and attractive, forward fruitiness. The aftertaste has delicious acidity and freshness.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Made with organic grapes and no added sulfites, this delightful blend of Merlot and Cabernet has aromas of spice and berry.

"This blend combines 64% Merlot with 34% Cabernet Franc and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon to nice effect, offering cranberry and red, juicy plum around softly cradled tannins and well-resolved oak.

"An perfumed wine, this is light and fruity. Bright raspberry flavors are lifted by refreshing acidity and a tang of zesty lemon. A touch of minerality gives texture. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley:Rosé
"Complex aromas have become a Luisa Ponzi hallmark; this one a potpourri of violets, cherry tobacco, clove and cedar, leading into a light, tart palate bursting with wild strawberries. The alcohol rests at 13.5%, but the wine is fully ripe, just not over the top. Graceful, perfectly executed winemaking, in a difficult vintage.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"For its bold footprint (and the amount of wood aging it went through) this rich Zinfandel offers a depth of pleasant berry flavor and a measured texture, with a savory edge on the finish.",US-California:Zinfandel

A hint of spice adds interest to the finish, with medium-light tannins and ample acidity resulting in good overall balance.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is dry and crisp and enormously complex. It flatters the palate with waves of blackberries, cherries, currants, tangerines, bacon, white pepper and sweet vanilla oak, and the all-important tannin structure is fine. It's 94% Syrah, while 6% Viognier brings the perfect bite of acidity and citrus.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Opens with earthy, leafy aromas that can best be described as “mature.” Throw in tobacco and baked plum, and the picture is complete.

"A blend of Sangiovese (42%), Merlot (32%), and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is one of the first wines coming off the estate vineyard located next to the winery. A full five years old, it's starting to show a touch of age aromatically, with notes of bittersweet chocolate, dried cherry and dried herb along with sliced green pepper. The palate shows the brightness of acidity that this region of the valley is known for, heightening the fruit flavors and stretching out the finish.",US-Washington:Red Blend

"This wine is sour, flat and past its prime, showing an abundance of tar and oak qualities.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"With its bone-dry, peppery, black currant and black cherry flavors, this is undeniably a Bordeaux-style wine, but it's all Merlot, not Cabernet, in its broad palate appeal. Despite the sizable tannins, it has an immediacy that makes it pleasurable now with steaks and chops.",US-California:Merlot
"Aromas of vanilla, coconut, barrel spice and dark fruit are followed by plentiful black-fruit flavors. It brings a lot of appeal, mixing fruit and barrel.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Big, rich wine, packed with spice, ripe peach and mango flavors. Designated a Library Wine by Knoll, it is complex, ageworthy, with a weight of both fruit and pepper to it. Keep this powerful wine for at least another 2–3 years.",Austria-Wachau:Grüner Veltliner
"Light, bright and balanced, this inexpensive Chardonnay is not complex and could use a little oomph in there somewhere, but has enough apple and pear flavor to get you through.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Thick and lush in red and black cherry, this wine has voluptuous tannins around a medium to full body. Structured and well balanced, it finishes in a tasty cloud of dust.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Sourced largely from the Martin Stelling Vineyard behind the winery in the western shade of Oakville, this wine opens with charred oak and a smoky, meaty character that intrigues. Seamless on the palate in soft, perceptible tannin, it delves into characteristics of cedar and brushy sage as it goes, unveiling a wildness that's hard to contain. Its bright, fresh finish gives it a roundness that's ready to enjoy now.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Slightly sweet aromas of Christmas spice, ginger, almond paste, cherry and plum cake characterize this luminous Barbaresco from Rizzi.

"A unique and unusual wine thanks to its soapy quality and beautiful notes of cut grass, melon and peach cobbler. Its creamy froth is soft and cushiony on the palate.",Italy-Piedmont:Moscato
"Earth and hay aromas open to an earthy tart-apple palate. There's an unusual mushroom note overall, and only a faint bead. Although the tart, dry finish is clean, it's low on zip and personality.",France-France Other:Sparkling Blend
"Good value in an everyday Merlot. Smooth and plush in texture, the ripe flavors include cherries, blackberries, mocha, dried herbs and peppery spices, with a touch of toasty oak.",US-California:Merlot

The mouthfeel is noticeably creamy, with more bready yeast, citrus peels and hints of hibiscus and jasmine.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A serious wine, filled with firm tannins, spiced with wood, and layered with bitter coffee as well as fruit. It certainly has power, the structure ready for long aging, firmly anchored in the dense character of this wine. It is a medium aging wine, 5–10 years.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Petrussa's Pinot Bianco opens with a rich, golden color and vibrant aromas of peach, melon, pineapple and white almond. The wine shows solid structure with a dense, creamy texture.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Bianco
"This Merlot over-delivers for the everyday price.

More than 15,000 cases produced.",US-California:Merlot
"Leesy, bready aromas are ripe and fruity. This is soft in feel and a touch heavy, which may be a reflection of the warm 2009 vintage. Nectarine and other ripe flavors finish full and sweet. This almost tastes like a brut Cava despite being a brut nature.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"Made from 95% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine leads with aromas of violet and red berry.

Extrasoft, velvety tannins characterize the finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Young and tight, this requires aggressive aeration before it begins to show much flavor.

Drink 2018 to 2030.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"At almost two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a dark, intense, cassis-laden wine. It's full-bodied and richly textured, with obvious cellaring potential of at least 7 or 8 years.

"This is a combination of 2003 Petite Sirah, as well as Syrah from both 2001 and 2004. Vineyards from Spring Mountain comprise a majority of the blend.

Raspberries, cherries, blueberries, plums and sweet leather and Asian spices are the main flavors.",US-California:Red Blend
"Showing some of the richness and structure of Vosne-Romanée, this is a concentrated wine, spiked with wood aging while also full of dark plum fruits. It is still integrating, bringing the spice from the wood more into balance. Drink from 2015.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir

It's light and delicate on the sip, with stone-fruit and tangerine-laced citrus flavors held up by a pithy structure and acid that rises toward the finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"In the Alentejo, Syrah exhibits power, body and concentration without much subtlety. So this wine is solid, tannic with considerable pepper and spice flavors that dominate the black fruits. Wood aging has softened the tannins. Acidity gives the wine a fresher finish.",Portugal-Alentejano:Syrah
"A sound introductory Pinot Noir, showing proper silkiness and spicy flavors of cherries and cola. Easy to drink, with no obvious faults.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"On the eastern end of the Bordeaux appellation, this Gazaniol property reserves 10 of 161 acres for its white blend. This is a ripe, soft wine that is rounded with peach and red-apple fruit flavors. Crisp acidity gives it some tightness to balance the full, fruity character of the wine. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon blended with 16% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc.

The mid-palate still needs some time to fully come together but when it does, it will be a beauty.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Quilceda makes big, muscular Cabernets, but the power is tightly controlled and never out of whack. Firm cherry fruit is edged with mixed spices from barrel aging. Still young and hard, this is a tannic wine that clearly has the stuffing and structure to age indefinitely, but if drunk now will require many hours of breathing time.

"Pure Petit Verdot is not an easy wine to balance. Here the cool vintage seems to have led to a disjointed wine with flavors that don't quite sync up.

"Dark berry, pressed flower, iron, leather and spice aromas come together on this firmly structured wine. The full-bodied palate delivers juicy black cherry, eucalyptus, anise and clove alongside big, velvety tannins. A licorice note closes the lingering finish. It's already almost approachable but hold for more complexity. Drink 2018–2028.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"You won't miss the taste of oak one bit, because this Chard is so rich and crisply stimulating on its own. It floods the palate with pineapple jam, peach pie, green apple butter, vanilla and cinnamon-honey granola flavors that are clean and pure.",US-California:Chardonnay
"There's no mistaking the variety, with aromas of sarsaparilla, underbrush and cherry, though a rubber-tire note provides some distraction. The cherry, strawberry and cranberry flavors show good concentration, though they seem a bit clunky at times.",US-Washington:Pinot Noir
"This pretty expression of Cabernet Franc delivers notes of carob, flowers and maraschino cherry. It's lighter in style with tart flavors and quite chalky tannins.",US-Oregon:Cabernet Franc
"This plump, medium-bodied rosé offers hints of peach and melon fruit, then finishes long and citrusy. It's very pale salmon in color, with an attractive coppery tint.",France-Rhône Valley:Rosé
"This Cartizze Prosecco is a bit unusual in the sense that is it extremely tonic and focused in the mouth whereas other wines from this vineyard tend to be softer and more feminine. Aromas include lime, kiwi and powdered mineral.",Italy-Veneto:Prosecco
"With some tannins and structure, this is still a juicy, red-berry-flavored wine. Acidity and the lightly dry core give shape to the bright, ripe fruitiness. Drink now.",Portugal-Lisboa:Portuguese Red
"Winemaker: Carl van der Merwe. A blend of 78% Grenache, 18% Syrah, 2% Mourvèdre and 2% Durif, this opens with a pronounced purple-floral character that rides atop a core of black raspberry, boysenberry and cherry fruit. Hints of toasted spice and tree bark add depth and interest, while smooth but present tannins lend structure to the medium-weight mouthfeel. A pleasant hit of smoky campfire lingers on the finish. Drink now–2021.",South Africa-Stellenbosch:Red Blend
"A very “Burgundian” Pinot Noir in the mushroom, pine needle and herb scents that accompany the deeper fruit flavors of black cherries and red currants, accented with savory clove spice. Structurally, the wine shows a brilliant architecture of firm tannins and crisp acids, with a deft touch of oak. Really a treat to drink, and should evolve for many years.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Sweet oak and lightly tropical fruit flavors characterize this young, tight, full-bodied Chardonnay. With another year or two in bottle, the fruit should emerge from behind the new oak flavors and enhance the overall balance. In the meanwhile, decanting is a good idea.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"The nose is limited and narrow, not fruity or tropical as it should be. A plump, soft palate is low on pulse, while lychee and honeydew flavors end bland and slightly bitter.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Torrontés
"This is powerful wine made at a high level, a blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Malbec and 8% Cabernet Franc. Muscular and dense, it offers a rich, ripe succulence of baked plum clafoutis, coconut, blackberry and clove within a dusty, gravelly brawn of dried herb and plush chocolate.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Though quite dark, spicy, smoky, fragrant and seductive, this is a very flavorful wine. Citrusy acids underscore flavors of grapefruit and orange, but the core of the wine is straightforward, pure and ripe berry. It's nice not to fight the fruit with oak; the aromatics are beautiful.",US-Washington:Syrah
"This is a light and charming Pinot Noir with aromas like cherry candy, bright fruit flavors and a touch of candied sweetness on the finish. It is light to medium bodied and benefits from crisp acidity and soft tannins to liven up the texture.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A lesson in contrasts: the nose is both weedy and sweet, with green strawberry aromas mixing with caramel. The palate is also green and slightly bitter, but that's offset by some jammy berry sweetness. Medium in terms of weight, but with burdensome sugars and a clumsy finish.",Spain-Levante:Tempranillo
"A bouquet of blackberry and juniper sets the scene for flavors of black cherry, red plum, anise, spearmint and pepper. Smooth on entry, bright and cool flavors fill the entire mouth, with tannins that make their presence known on the midpalate and then recede into a soft cool finish.",Israel-Judean Hills:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Good fruit from the Riverbend vineyard brings earthy complexity to the wine. Sappy boysenberry fruit, soaked in barrel flavors of Kahlua and cinnamon, shows just a bit of alcoholic heat heading into the finish.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Lots to admire in this Cab. It's bone dry and rich in blackberry and cedar flavors, with overtones of mocha, anise and toast, and is very tannic. Clearly made in a leaner style than today's high-alcohol cult style, it trades some richness for elegance and finesse. This is a wine that puts its bet on cellaring. Try after 2013.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made with 40% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 10% Syrah and 5% Petit Verdot, this offers aromas of red currant, cedar and cooking spice. The firm palate delivers anise, white pepper and dried aromatic herb alongside assertive tannins. Drink 2017–2021.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"From old vines, as are most of the wines from this producer, this is a dense and powerful wine. New wood aging has given the wine a strongly toasty character balanced with creamy apple and yellow fruits. The wine is concentrated and obviously needs to age. Drink from 2022.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Gentle fruit notes hint at yellow pear, cantaloupe melon and ripe apricot.

The more you savor, the more this gives.",Austria-Kremstal:Grüner Veltliner
"Aged for six months in wood, this is a rich rosé. The wood aging shows in a toasty edge, although the wine is just as much about crisp red fruits. It has a tight texture and structure, a mineral edge and citrus fresh aftertaste.",Portugal-Alentejano:Rosé
"A rounded style of wine, its texture full of warm fruits, pear, apricot and some lime juice to give a fresh edge. It is full of flavor, with apples and cream flavors, layered with crisp, tight acidity, but all within the context of a full, dense wine. Glass stopper.",Austria-Kremstal:Riesling
"This lovely wine has a great depth of decadent, succulent aromas of citrus and apple blossom, that explode around tangy acidity. Pear, quince and lemongrass-ginger spice dot the palate in measured, beautiful ways, finishing balanced and crisp.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Delara is Maysara's mid-priced Pinot Noir. The wine is a block selection, and it is still rather tightly wound, despite the extra time in bottle. The fruit is dark and laden with exotic spices, and as you dive into the flavors you find smoke, licorice, earth and rock. This is a wine that would be quite interesting to age, but if you drink it now, be sure to spend time with it, as it runs through its delightful changes. Decanting is highly recommended.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This is an excellent appellation blend, starting with a slightly sweet nose of concentrated grenadine, carnations and wild herbs. The sip dries up considerably, with lots of eucalyptus showing at first and then a strong candied raspberry flavor riding the herbs and a strong acidity. Strawberry arises into the finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Behind the tannins, the fruit is beginning to broaden out and become rich. An attractive juicy character comes from the fresh black currant and berry fruits. Give this wine until 2016 and it will be ready to drink. Consulting oenologue Claude Gaudin manages this Médoc region estate.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"It's pretty hard in mouth-numbing tannins. But it's also vastly rich in blackberries, dark chocolate, cassis liqueur, peppery spices, smoky oak, and a note of bacon, with all its umami attractions. Showing power but not much finesse now, it will hold through 2017. Beyond that, its future is risky.",US-California:Syrah
"Few Pinot Noirs are as delicious right out of the bottle. Dazzles with tiers of raspberry and cherry tart, smoky pie crust, cinnamon and nutmeg spices and a sweet squirt of vanilla. For all the richness, it's dry and crisp. Drink now with seared tuna, lamb chops, beef tenderloin.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Lalande de Pomerol is the northern extension of Pomerol, so it's no surprise to find this wine dominated by Merlot. It is soft, rounded and rich. Black plums give the fruitiness while black fruit skins provide the texture. It's a full wine that needs a little aging. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This 100% Merlot is sourced from Sagemoor Farms' Bacchus and Dionysus vineyards. For the first time, there is no Cabernet Franc in the blend.

Thick and flat-out luscious, yet structured with a tannic spine that gives definition and focus all the way through.",US-Washington:Merlot
"This wine has vibrant aromas of lemon, lime and wet stone, with a hint of lightly buttered popcorn. Flavors of pineapple, lemon and yellow apple unfold on the palate, hit by a dusting of oaky spice.

"This blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah is a terrific bargain. It's full-bodied and creamy in texture yet without excessive weight, featuring complex notes of garrigue and cherries, plus hints of chocolate, cinnamon and clove. Finishes silky and long. Drink now–2025.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend

A sweet, mature wine at its core, with molasses and brown sugar.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"This blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Charbono is similar to wines made from those field-blended vineyards where several grape varieties are inter-planted. The wine is dry and robust, with intensely fruity, spicy flavors and firm tannins. Best now for its sheer exuberance.",US-California:Red Blend

This is a simple and straightforward expression of Prosecco with tight perlage and medium aromas of white flower and citrus. That subtle but soft sweetness you taste would pair nicely next to vegetable tempura.,Italy-Veneto:Glera

Full blackberry, cassis and herbal flavors finish cool and toasty but long due to the wine's full-force acidity.",Uruguay-Canelones:Tannat

Drink 2010–2020.",Australia-South Australia:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Smells a little strange, baked and like corn. And as it airs out, it shows a mealy, cider-like side. In the mouth, there's sweet pineapple flavors and then a thin finish.

A blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz, both grapes very much at home in the Dão, the wine is full of solid tannins, concentrated black fruits and a dark texture. Fermenting in open tanks has helped the wine gain its broad rich texture. Drink from 2020.",Portugal-Dão:Portuguese Red

This is 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, with Carmenère and Merlot.",Chile-Maule Valley:Red Blend

"Subtle flavors and a great sense of balance will make this low-alcohol but medium-bodied wine versatile before or during a meal.

"Terrale translates as “product of the earth,” and that’s about all one can say about this wine. The grapes used are Catarrato, a white variety indigenous to Sicily, and the ubiquitous Trebbiano. A light apple nose starts it off, and the structure is good, with adequate acids. However, the finish is short and lacks flavor.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:White Blend
"This is a richly structured and deliciously juicy wine. The tannins are fully integrated into the fruit. The downside of the wine is a touch of greenness, particularly in the acidity.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

It's drinking well now, but the moderate tannins suggest it should hold through 2016.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend

Spicy and dense, it's a lively blend of lime, apple, apricot and pear fruits. A trickle of juicy acidity pulls the flavors through into a finish with streaks of vanilla and clove. The 20-year-old vines provide the complexity and detail that will reward another decade of aging. Drink now through 2025.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay

"Clifton Hill Syrah looks and smells the way you'd hope it would, black in the center, purple/garnet at the edges, peppery and loaded with sweet grapey fruit.

It's juicy and fairly light in flavor, but clean and very fresh, with no new oak.",US-Washington:Syrah
"The emphasis here is squarely on the fruit, which is fresh and varietal, carrying flavors of apricot, peach and apple. Pleasing aromas support the impression of ripe stone fruit, with moderate alcohol and none of the bitterness that Viognier can show in the finish.",US-Washington:Viognier
"This power-packed wine leads with aromas of raspberries, blackberries, dark chocolate and herbs. The dark fruit flavors are high octane, showing some warmth on the finish.",US-Washington:Syrah

"Like all of Alta Vista's single-vineyard Malbecs, this is opaque in color and ripe on the nose. Aromas of balsamic-coated raisin, black cherry and chocolate scream ripe and rich.

It drinks as a more mature wine than the vintage date might suggest.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"A 100% varietal wine blended from three vineyard sites, this has fantastic aromatics, floral and meaty in all the best ways.

"Fruity in blackberry and cherry flavors, this is easy to drink, with a good acid-tannin balance.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Shows the usual Williams Selyem Chardonnay profile of huge fruit and flashy oak. This opulent wine would be over-the-top except that it's balanced by crisp, lemony acidity, and somehow retains a tight core with a gravitational tug that keeps the richness focused. Impressive now for sheer power, and should hold well for another 5–6 years.",US-California:Chardonnay

"Dusty, bready apple aromas are direct and not too yeasty. This feels tight and refined, with citric acidity. Lightly briny apple and citrus flavors finish steady and fresh, but also smooth. For brut nature, this gets things right.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"This is the first Cabernet Sauvignon release from Meomi founder Joe Wagner. Sourced from vineyards across the appellation, it shows simple yet focused dark cherry and chocolate flavors, dusty tannin and subtle oak, within a framework of moderate acidity and ripeness.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"An already mature, toasty Champagne, with yeast, dry toast and almond flavors. The grapefruit edge from primary fruits is there, but this wine is filling out, becoming deliciously open and certainly entering maturity. Enjoy as a food Champagne.",France-Champagne:Chardonnay
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (57%), Syrah (27%), Petit Verdot (15%) and Merlot delivers a medley of herb, baker's chocolate, smoke, plum and black tea aromas. Fine-grained tannins support its dark fruit flavors, which stretch long into the finish. Highly styled yet lovely.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Tastes fresh and fruity with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors. Wants slightly sweet, spicy foods to accompany, like a sausage-based pasta.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Made from Negroamaro, this coppery, peach-hued rosé is rather weighty, with flavors that run toward cherries and chocolate. You could serve it with rich seafood dishes, but it can also stand up to grilled beef.",Italy-Southern Italy:Rosé
"Off by a few beats from the '02, the '03 shows red currant, plumped raisin and green mint jelly notes. The flavors are good, but the wine, which is soft in structure, is not an ager.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is Gainey's basic '05 Pinot, and it shows the quality of the vintage. The wine is dry, crisp in acidity and under 14% in alcohol, with dramatic cherry and boysenberry fruit complexed with leather, cola, Chinese five spice and balsamic notes. Fairly tannic, it's best now and for a few years.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This Chardonnay has depth, starting with its unfolding nose of ripe Chardonnay fruit, minerals, hazelnut and citrus. The palate offers flavors of pear, citrus and grapefruit, its character refreshing and fruity but somewhat complex. An impressive white that can handle richer dishes.",US-New York:Chardonnay
"This wine is a blend of Grenache (49%), Syrah (20%), Cinsault (16%), Mourvèdre (9%) and Counoise. Complex aromas of raspberry, blueberry, dried herbs and pepper lead to reserved yet rich fruit flavors that put a premium on purity. Give it time to open up.",US-Washington:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Smoky, roasted and full on the bouquet, with rich berry and plum aromas. The palate is fleshy, with a chunky middle but just enough tannin and acid to provide structure. Tastes of baked black fruits, fig and herbs. Dry and snappy on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Rounded, smooth and fruity, this is an attractive wine. With its light texture and acidity that balance the juicy black fruits, it is ripe while also poised. The aftertaste is fresh and fruity.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"There's plenty of cherry pie, red currant, mushroom and sandalwood flavor in this dry Cab Franc, which was blended with a little Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot for complexity. It feels stylish, yet there's a tough, astringent mouthfeel that seems unlikely ever to go away.",US-California:Cabernet Franc
"Aromas of ground black pepper, blackberry, cured meats and plum lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The extracted palate delivers toasted notes, roasted coffee bean, espresso, blackberry extract, chocolate and vanilla alongside teeth-coating tannins. Drink 2016–2020.",Italy-Veneto:Red Blend
"In its first couple of vintages, Le Sol was almost Australian in character, but it is now taking a more perfumed and elegant tack, with this '07 featuring hints of rhubarb and cracked pepper on the nose, and dark berry fruit matched by savory notes of coffee and black olives on the palate. It's creamy in texture, yet without excess weight, and finishes long. Drink now–2020.",New Zealand-Hawke's Bay:Syrah
"Made entirely from Cabernet from a single vineyard block, this wine explores the variety's more savory side, with aromas of leafy herbs, green pepper, cigar box, musk and dark chocolate. The cherry flavors are tart backed by chewy tannins.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon

"The 2007 vintage was beautiful in Umbria, and this proves to be a stand out wine with enormous power, personality and depth. It delivers gorgeous intensity with pulses of black cherry, chocolate fudge, spice, leather and pipe tobacco. The finish is soft and rich.",Italy-Central Italy:Sagrantino
"A nose of black cherry, violet and vanilla paves the way for a grown up mélange of fruit and savory flavors that include raspberry, cassis, brambles and smoked meat. Long-lasting tannins coat the palate through a finish marked by notes of berries and smoke.",Israel-Galilee:Red Blend
"The bouquet is dosed with resiny oak and vanilla aromas, but there are herbal notes, leather and red fruit scents as well. It feels good but slightly sticky, with flavors of vanilla, coconut, tomato, red plum and herb. This feels good on the finish, with tobacco, vanilla and oak flavors. Drink now through 2015.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"This cuvée is not as ripe as it was in the 2010 vintage. It has a pleasant tomato-soup character—a mix of ripe tomato and light, fresh flavors of basil and cilantro. It also has plenty of tart cherry flavors filling in the midpalate, and is well proportioned for drinking over the next few years.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Shows the typicity of the vineyard, an angular, minerally wine with crisp acids and concentrated flavor. The tastes of white peaches, pineapples and tangerines are edged with zesty spices. Finishes with vanilla-honey coating of toasty oak.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Thick in cherry-vanilla, big oak and tannin, this vineyard-designate contains handfuls of Petite Sirah and mixed blacks that are, as the producer puts it, too long to list. Given 10 months in American oak, it offers a balance of fruit and leathery power, from raspberry and blackberry to Sunday morning bacon. Drink now through 2020.",US-California:Zinfandel
"A flagship of the Faiveley range, this is a structured wine with great acidity and beautiful perfumes. The wine is dense, already balanced with the red fruits shining through the tannins. It will develop slowly and will not be ready to drink before 2023.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
This wine puts the floral aspects of the varietal front and center. Rose petal and flower-soap aromas lead onto the palate that bears similar flavors and a hint of residual sugar. It shows nice concentration.,US-Washington:Gewürztraminer
"Firm tannins mark this as a wine for aging. At the same time, the sweet and ripe fruit gives weight and richness. Wood flavors just creep in to round out the tannins at the end. Keep for 7–8 years.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Dark blueberry, black plum and blackberry fruits meet with dried violet, lavender and cracked pavement on the nose of this bottling. The palate picks up a soy-meets-blueberry-chiffon element, with splashes of rosewater and cola.",US-California:Syrah

"There's been lots to like from this SoCal winery, and this bottling adds to the list. Rusty in color, it offers cranberry, strawberry, sagebrush and iron aromas. The palate pops with zesty pomegranate fruit, lifted by herbal garrigue notes and spice.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A old-vine blend of Encruzado and Malvasia Fina, this is an important wine. It has density, spice from wood aging and a wonderfully perfumed character from the Malvasia. The wine is structured with its concentrated fruit and toastiness. It needs to age and should not be drunk until 2018. Decant before pouring.",Portugal-Dão:Portuguese White
This is a really light wine with bright fruit and a crisp texture. It has a breezy feel—all crisp fruit and lively acidity. Drink now.,France-Provence:Rosé
"Lots to like about this wine, from the Sonoma side of Spring Mountain. Shows firm, fine tannins and well-developed blackberry and cherry flavors. But there's a disturbingly hot, sweet quality, the result of excessive alcohol, and also a sweaty, animal taste that possibly comes from brettanomyces spoilage.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Leather, ripe berry, clove, mature berry, baking spice and a balsamic whiff of menthol lift out of the glass. The firm, succulent palate offers black cherry, clove and star anise. Youthfully assertive but refined tannins and fresh acidity provide structure and balance. Drink through 2025.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Full bodied and viscous on the palate, the wine is balanced by bright acidity that gives it good focus. Peach, grapefruit, apple and spice notes are at the core here, followed by a lemony fresh finish. Quite fruity in style and fairly sweet. Try it as an aperitif or with duck and sweet sauces.",US-California:Riesling
"Still firm and structured, this pure Malbec wine is rich and tannic. At the same time, it has layers of ripe black fruits that are coming through strongly. The smoky, textured character of this wine comes from the wood aging that has added an extra layer. Drink from 2018.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"This is a solid, well-crafted and flavorful Malbec. Black fruit and cocoa aromas set up a concentrated palate, bearing chewy, dense flavors of black plum, wild berry and chocolate, plus toast and pepper notes. Production is 100,000-plus cases.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Despite this estate remaining among the top echelon of New Zealand Riesling producers, Framingham's Pinot Noir is solid but unexciting. It's plump and medium bodied, and it offers modest cherry fruit and a touch of bitterness on the finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Pinot Noir
"All three grape varieties in this blend offer their own special contribution. The result is balance—a dry, smoothly tannic wine with lots of upfront berry, spice, leather and sandalwood notes.",US-California:Red Blend
"An off-dry character sets the scene for this concentrated, already balanced wine. The Hatschbourg vineyard in the southern Alsace village of Voegtlinshoffen is composed of clay and chalk soil on a southeast-facing slope. It gives exceptional ripeness, as here, a warm and full-bodied wine with great swathes of fruitiness. Drink from 2017.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"Almost neutral in flavor, this light and smooth wine is innocuous, crisp and refreshing.",US-California:Pinot Grigio
"Cool weather in 2012 kept acid levels high, something that comes across clearly in this wine. The fruit is bright and crisp—more like pie cherry than Bing or Rainier—and turns tart on the finish. Because of this, it could be one of those Pinot Noirs that pairs well with salmon.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Pinot Noir
"Aromas of white fruit and citrus lead, followed by semi-sweet tropical fruit and citrus flavors with a touch of acidity. Fresh-tasting and friendly, this makes for a great summer sip. Serve with Asian cuisine, grilled foods.",US-New York:Riesling

"Lychee and kiwi soda aromas meet up with slight yeastiness on the nose of this single-vineyard Sauvignon Blanc. A sharp zing of acidity runs from the front of the palate to the finish, with apple cider flavors holding up the fruit. Serve with fish tacos.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Firm tannins make this wine solid and dry. It has banana and bright cherry fruits well integrated with the acidity. The aftertaste suggests the wine could benefit from a few more months before drinking, so wait until 2017.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Fresh and buoyant, this has bright aromas of cherry cough drop, cola, rosemary oil and ginger. It is ethereal and clean with a very lively and polished mouthfeel.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"This bottling comes from two Pinot clones planted within a 6.5-acre vineyard in Blucher Valley, a frigid, low-yielding site. On the edge of ripeness, the wine is unusual in orange pith, cranberry and pomegranate with a vividly tangy crispness. Soy, balsam and pine tar provide an edgy character that adds complexity and texture.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"On 15 acres on the hill above Angélus and under the same ownership, the vineyard is 100% Merlot. This wine is ripe with red fruits, with a structure that shows the chalk soil. Tannins and a dense texture will allow it to develop over the medium-term. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux:Merlot
"At 98 years of age, the vineyard certainly qualifies as old vine, which isn't the case with all wines so labeled. Who really knows what varieties actually constitute these ancient vineyards, but this wine is certainly rich in Zinfandel character. The wild raspberry and cherry fruits have a briary edge, suggesting the tartness of Dr. Pepper cola, the nettles of summer chamomile and the savoriness of green peppercorn. There's little question that the wine will age well, but there's no reason not to drink it now, with proper decanting.",US-California:Zinfandel
"A buttery aroma leads to rich butterscotch flavors and a buttery finish, too. But then there's more with each sip. The wine is dry but easy on the palate, and reveals tasty apple, almond and toasted walnut flavors with time. These all add complexity and lift it well above the ordinary. Made with certified Biodynamic grapes.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Beautiful Syrah at a fair price. It's soft and velvety, with rich, complex flavors of chocolate, blackberries, succulent anise biscotti and violets, with smoky, cedary notes from oak. Drink now.",US-California:Syrah
"Hard-spice aromas rest on top of cherry and briar aromas. Fresh and snappy on the palate, this medium-bodied Rioja delivers fully oaked flavors of vanilla and butter along with strawberry and raspberry fruit. A distinct buttery flavor rides high on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain:Red Blend
"After years of tasting Don David Malbecs, here's one that rises above the rest. This is jammy and stacked with brawny black-fruit aromas. The mouth is bulky and bullish, but balanced, with blackberry flavors that are coated with copious oak and end in a tornado of coffee, mocha, mint and oak. Drink now–2016.",Argentina-Other:Malbec
"84-86 Tough, only with tannins. Very hard wine, firm.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Defines what makes this appellation great for Cabernet, but also why it won't rival Napa anytime soon. Brilliantly ripe fruit, lovely balance, such a pretty taste of the earth and, in this case, expensive oak. But there's that extra something it aspires to and doesn't quite achieve. It has to do with complexity of tannins.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This intense wine comes from a small parcel of six acres. Produced from organically grown grapes, it is crisp, clean and with a directness that is both refreshing and initially shocking in its intensity. The wine is rich, full in the mouth, tight and still young. Drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Playful and nearly effervescent on the nose with lemon-lime soda notes and a sparkling pear-cider character, this bottling also shows aromas of pink grapefruit and pink lemonade sorbet. Tart lime and lemon verbena pop on the palate as does melon pith, with a slight herbal character on the finish.",US-California:Grüner Veltliner
"Named after the Lyre style of vine training, this wine comes from the far north of Burgundy, close to Chablis. It is soft, smooth and creamy, with a light minerality and perfumed acidity. It is just right to drink now.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Jasmine and summer blossom hover over ripe, aromatic aspects suggesting melon or quince that shine with power on the dry, streamlined and taut palate. The freshness is immense in this precise, bracing and charming wine.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"This high-acid, intense wine is beautifully aromatic, with piercing and tart flavors of cranberry and raspberry, pure and laced with minerality. Terrific penetration, the persistence of wet stone, citrus, raspberry and cranberry flavors is impressive.",US-Washington:Grenache
"Alain and Céline Vidal's second brand (they also own Château Dubraud) is a fruity blend of Merlot (60%), Cabernet Sauvignon (25%) and Cabernet Franc (15%) although the smoky wood flavors also have an important place. Red berries and black currants partner with acidity and firm tannins. The wine is still developing so drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Ripe mango perfume extends from the nose to the palate of this bright, tropical, medium-sweet Riesling. Concentrated, with loads of sweet fruits and sunny yellow flowers, it's a straightforward yet irresistibly juicy sip.",US-New York:Riesling
"Lush and inviting on the nose, with blackberry, kirsch, lilac, licorice and balsamic notes, this bottling shows promise for the warmer side of the new Malibu appellation. It's soft on the palate, offering complex black plum skin, soy, loam and meat flavors, brightened with mint. Quite pricey, nonetheless.",US-California:Red Blend
"New oak dominates this wine, and the tannins, which are derived from both the wood and the grapes, give it an unrelieved astringency. Not showing much pleasure now, but there's a solid core of blackberries and black cherries. It's unclear if the fruit will outlast the tannins.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"True to the variety, this expression of Riesling offers touches of nature rubber and kerosene backed by a light and luminous mouthfeel. There's a touch of sweetness as well as a polished mineral aftertaste.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Riesling
"This straightforward white opens offers aromas of tomato vine, exotic fruit and a whiff of elderflower. The tangy, slender palate shows grapefruit, sage and a hint of green melon lifted by crisp acidity. It finishes clean and refreshing.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon
"Entirely sourced from this Sangiacomo family-farmed vineyard, which is planted entirely to the Old Wente clone, this wine offers fleshy and tropical juiciness and texture. Aged in French oak, the vast majority of it neutral, the wine lets the fruit and acidity speak for themselves.",US-California:Chardonnay
"There's lots of sweet oak in this wine, with dominant flavors of buttered toast, buttered popcorn and vanilla. Underneath there's some nice apricot and tangerine fruit.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Perfumed green fruits, a crisp texture and layers of tight acidity all point to a wine that is too young to drink. Its hints of ripe white fruits and tangy orange peel are still developing. Drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Opening with scents of mature orchard fruit, dried herb and a balsamic note, this nine-year-old wine aptly demonstrates the aging potential of Greco di Tufo. The surprisingly fresh palate shows an impressive depth of flavors including dried apricot, juicy tangerine, candied lemon drop and sage. A flinty mineral vein energizes the finish.",Italy-Southern Italy:Greco
"Savory, smoky aromas of campfire and grilled beef become leathery as this airs out. This feels wiry and alive, but the flavor profile is stalky and briny, with hints of red plum and raspberry. An odd, nutty flavor rises up on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"This is the kind of wine that tastes like no effort was spared in its production. It's impeccably made, with clean, ripe fruit, crisp acidity and a nice touch of oak. The palate is full of California-ripe Meyer lemons and peaches with a touch of New Zealand gooseberry.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"This boasts a classic nose of red berry, forest floor, spice rack and a balsamic note. The full-bodied palate delivers juicy red cherry, mature strawberry, clove, grilled herbs and anise alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. An earthy note of truffle closes the finish.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Crisp wine, with some slight creaminess, green apple flavors and a herbal edge. The wine is light and fresh.",France-Burgundy:Aligoté
"Celery, lettuce and lime aromas are cool and green. This is showing tangy, snappy acidity in support of lime, tarragon, sage and scallion flavors. A fresh, racy finish is fitting.",Chile-Leyda Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Rubbery, resiny aromas are borderline unpleasant. This feels heavy and cidery, while stalky, pickled, woody flavors dominate. An oaky, briny tasting finish leaves little room for platitudes.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Chardonnay
"Quite roasty-toasty, this is heavily scented with coffee and smoke. Smooth tannins surround plummy fruit, and there is enough concentration for a good, long finish. The blend includes 8% Cab Sauvignon, 4% Petit Verdot and a splash of Merlot. Just 150 cases were made.",US-Washington:Cabernet Franc
"Retailer-turned-winemaker Doug Margerum drops aromas of boysenberry-cherry pie with peppercorn crust on this wine, which slightly predates the Ballard Canyon appellation creation. The flavors are down the middle, with ripe elderberries, Italian herbs and hops providing an intriguing, heady mix.",US-California:Syrah
Ripe red fruits dominate this soft and juicy wine. The light structure and touch of tannin give shape to this easy wine. Drink now.,Portugal-Lisboa:Portuguese Red
"Pear freshness, yeasty savor and citrus zip combine on the palate of this easy-drinking, fresh and enlivening Grüner. There is an earthy, sonorous note at the core that balances the airy freshness.",Austria-Kamptal:Grüner Veltliner
"Fine green fruit gives great freshness in this crisp, citrus and apple flavored wine, lightly softened with melon. Pure, clean, a lively, bright wine.",Austria-Weinviertel:Grüner Veltliner
"Nambrot features inviting aromas of sweet cherry, vanilla bean and espresso grinds. The wine is sweet and succulent in the mouth with blueberry flavors and a long, spicy finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
The wine has some extraction that leaves a bitter edge. That needs to blow off to allow the underlying ripe blackberry fruit to come through. So wait until 2018.,France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Mulchy and gaseous on the nose, this subsequently turns scouring and acidic on the palate, with a leafy, dry red-plum flavor. Herbal, dry and not very fruity overall.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"A ripe, rounded wine, with intense flavors of apple skins, pear and white peach, with just a hint of nut. Described as dry, this has some richness to balance the definite acidity, which gives a lift but certainly no hardness.",France-Loire Valley:Chenin Blanc
"This is the winery's sixth vintage of Zinfandel from the Zephyr Ridge vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills. It's ripe and substantial, soft and loaded with rich berry fruit flavors. Despite the high (27.1) brix, the wine is neither hot nor jammy, and keeps plenty of acid behind stiff, lightly earthy tannins. It is one of the best Zins yet from the winery that pioneered the grape in Washington State.",US-Washington:Zinfandel
"A soft, creamy wine, with crispness on the palate. It is ripe and clean with a touch of vanilla and appley acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Chardonnay
"Very dark, rich and dramatic. Massively constructed, with vast reserves of blackberry jam, blackstrap molasses, mocha, smoked meat, mushu plum sauce and sweet, smoky oak. The tannins are big, ripe and astringent. A great Cabernet that clearly needs plenty of time. Drink 2015 and beyond.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Scratchy aromas of raspberry and licorice gumdrop precede a grabby, sticky palate with raw tannins. Plum and berry flavors are standard for Malbec, while the finish shows a mild baked character.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"The nose on this creative blend of 52% Gewürztraminer, 25% Sauvignon Blanc and 23% Chenin Blanc is quite showy with peach, baked orange, apple blossom and honeysuckle notes. But the real star is the palate that is racy with sizzling energy and flavors of cut grass, lemongrass and sour-apple peels.",US-California:White Blend
"Another stellar El Puntido, this time with excellent concentration and full-load aromas of black fruit, leather, fine dried cheese and cola. The palate is tight, properly stretched and racy, with bursting black raspberry and cassis flavors. Coconut and resin on the finish is the first and only glaring announcement of oak. Drink now through 2014.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"This is a lighter style of Pinot Noir than some produced in Sancerre today. It brings out perfumes and red-cherry flavors lifted by acidity. The wine is fruity, with hints of wood aging and a juicy aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley:Pinot Noir
"Takes the popular route, with caramelized oak and ripe fruit that taste sweet. Almost like a dessert wine, showing tangerine, vanilla and buttered toast flavors that pall after a sip or two.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This is a small, 10-acre property, owned by the Moueix family, at the heart of the Pomerol plateau. With its 30% Cabernet Franc it is perfumed and ripe, giving delicious black fruits as well as a firmer structure. The wine is set for a long aging with great potential. Drink from 2024.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is an over-soft wine, without real bite or crispness. It is pleasantly creamy, with almond flavors and a full mousse, but the soft character continues right through to the finish.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Cadus from Nieto Senetiner has not been overly consistent in recent years. This wine is black as night, with ultra-extracted aromas of black fruit and chocolate. The palate is hunky and chunky, with clumsy grape, cassis and blackberry flavors. Shows a blast of coconut and softness on the finish. A classic fruit bomb that's missing some key parts.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Lots of oak on this wine, which shows rich vanilla custard, buttered toast and caramel flavors. However, the underlying fruit isn't able to support it. There's some pineapple and nectarine, but the wine ultimately collapses under all the wood.",US-California:Chardonnay
"A lovely Pinot Noir, made in a drier style that preserves elegance while maintaining a powerful varietal character. Feels pure and refined in the mouth, with deep, rich flavors of cherries and pomegranates and earthier notes of mushrooms, soy sauce, cola and licorice. Elegant and crisp, and an ager. Best now–2015.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Softly tannic and dry, with a punch of acidity, this Cab has fully developed flavors of red and black currants, raisins, mocha and cinnamon spice. Drink it now with barbecue.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

The palate features ripe black cherry, coffee, espresso, vanilla and grilled sage alongside bracing tannins. Drink after 2016.",Italy-Central Italy:Red Blend
"This poised late-harvest blend of Loin de l'Oeil and Sauvignon Blanc tastes lightly honeyed, with an edge of dry botrytis. Perhaps more prominent are the dried apricot and spice notes, along with balanced acidity. Intense and in need of more aging, it will be best from late 2018.",France-Southwest France:White Blend
"This clear and bright cranberry-red wine sports a pungent nose with spice, cranberry, mocha and light cherry scents and flavors. Shows some interesting herbal nuances of thyme and oregano. Good focus in a fruit-forward style; tight and delicious with a pretty finish.",US-Washington:Sangiovese

"Fresh, light and clean, this pretty Lambrusco offers aromas of wild berries and a touch of chopped herb. In the mouth, the wine is thin and pristine with balanced acidity.",Italy-Central Italy:Lambrusco
"Vigna Rionda is among the finest crus in the Serralunga d'Alba area with 40- to 60-year-old vines and this producer takes a traditional approach to Barolo. It opens with a slightly brownish hue and seems older than the vintage thanks to aromas of old spice, used leather and dried herbs. The mouthfeel is raw, but firm.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"The wine has all the warmth and ripe fruit of the vintage. Its tangy character is balanced by apple and pear fruits, along with refreshing acidity. Smoothly textured, the wine is ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Smoke, ash and graphite notes form an elegant frame to wild berries, orange zest and blue flowers. Cherry wood and mesquite appear in the mouth and the wine is capped by tight, drying tannins.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Intense and crisp, it shows bright fruits and some weight as well. A touch of yellow fruits give the grapefruit a warmer character and good depth of flavor. It's a Vinho Verde for cooler days, ripe and ready for food.",Portugal-Vinho Verde:Portuguese White
"This is a friendly, New World- style Chardonnay, with flavors of toast, oak and spice and decent complexity. Assertive and upfront, it's a good everyday white for fans of whites with pronounced flavors.",South Africa-Western Cape:Chardonnay
"The Jim Clendenen project focuses on wines the winemaker makes to please his palate more so than the bottom line. This one discloses aromas of white flowers, honeysuckle, applewood and a slight nuttiness. The palate shows smoked apple, chalk and lime zest.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
This is a fresh and crisp wine with touches of sweetness. Red fruits are combined with ripe apple and acidity to give a lively fruity wine. Drink now.,France-Loire Valley:Rosé
"A blend of co-fermented Syrah (60%) and Viognier, this wine is a very pretty pale copper color with just a tinge of salmon. It offers nuanced aromas of pear, strawberry and white flowers. The palate is dry and fresh, sleek but with depth and texture to the fruit flavors.",US-Washington:Rosé
"They can't call the grapes old vine, because the vineyard is only 15 years old. But it was planted from clones that constituted an old vineyard that contained Petite Sirah, Carignane, Mataro and Alicante Bouschet. The wine is robust and rustic, with bright, briary berry fruit and spice flavors that will stand up well against any roasted meats.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This is an interesting wine, with dense and deep layers of chocolate, licorice and other barrel flavors, buttressed with ripe, clean berry-flavored fruit. The alcohol is in balance, and the aromas carry a mix of wild herb, grass and grain. It's impossible to know where this wine will travel as it ages, but it certainly will light up any dinner party conversation in the near term. Best guess? Drink up soon.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This big-bodied wine is full of smoke, toast and custard in the nose, sure signs of barrel fermentation or aging. The mouth is packed with thick, custardy citrus fruit, which renders it a bit like orange-tinged flan. Fortunately, it retains its acids, which keeps it well balanced despite the heavy oaking it went through.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a beautiful Riesling. It's not totally dry, like the label says, because there's a vein of honey that enriches the orange, apricot and white flower flavors, and persists into the finish. The acidity is ample, and there's a minerality that suggests steel and stones.",US-California:Riesling

"Made entirely with Sangiovese and aged in large Slavonian oak casks, this is a delicious and traditionally crafted Chianti Classico, showing a classic varietal fragrance of violet, berry and tobacco. The vibrant palate delivers a tight core of wild cherry layered with black pepper and cinnamon accents. Refined and perfectly balanced.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Ripe tangerine, peach, green apple and vanilla flavors combine with brisk, citrusy acidity in this wine. This wine saw a touch of neutral oak, which seems to have contributed a smoky toast character. It picks up complexities as it warms and airs, so don't drink this too cold.",US-California:Grenache Blanc

"Packaged with a label depicting a colorful if inventive map of the appellation, this wine conveys hibiscus punch, cranberry and cherry notes on the nose, with a touch of lavender and sagebrush. Biting acidity and peppery grip dance on the palate, where cranberry and plum skins are tart and bitter but leveled by fresh oregano herbs.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Ripe black cherries with a hint of garrigue mark the nose of this attractively plump red from Ferraton. The fruit dominates, but there's just enough savory complexity to make it interesting, with a firm yet silky finish. Drink now–2017.",France-Rhône Valley:Syrah
"Dense intitial aromas suggest rubber on top of blackberry. In the mouth, this Tempranillo is deep as a trench, with layering and firm tannins.

This is a wine that has tannins as well as crisp red-currant fruit. It is lightly textured with a bright shot of acidity. The aftertaste is fresh and lively.,France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"This blend of Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Petit Meslier, Arbanne, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay must be one of the most complex blends in Champagne. It is very different and its flavors are exotic and spicy, hinting at tropical. There is a haunting perfume to the aromas, while the palate is intensely structured. For the adventurous.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Barely drinkable, although you'll get by at big parties where nobody cares. It's silky, sweet and minty.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"One of the better Malbec-based wines of the region, this fairly priced blend, which includes 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Petite Sirah and 2% Syrah, offers a dense core of blackberry jam that's covered by layers of loam, charred beef, black pepper and smoke. The dense black-cherry and blueberry flavors are cut by intense pepper, vanilla bean and prominent cappuccino, all frame by woody tannins.",US-California:Malbec
"Lemon blossom, apple and mineral aromas meet in a regular place. The palate is chunky and shows just enough acidity, and the flavors run towards generic citrus, apple and green melon. Falls off on the finish, so drink as soon as possible.",Spain-Northern Spain:Verdejo
"A classic Zinfandel with its unmistakable spice aroma and wild berry flavor, this is dry and tannic enough to provide balance. Medium bodied, it packs plenty of flavor and an appetizing mouthfeel.",US-California:Zinfandel
"The wine is ripe, still young with its fresh fruits and acidity. The elements are all there to produce a dark and dense wine that has fine structure. It's a complex blend of Alfrocheiro, Syrah and Touriga Nacional, all of which will allow the wine to age over a good few years. Drink this impressive wine from 2017.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese Red
"A blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Cabernet Franc from a sweet vineyard spot near Dalle Valle, this is a lovely, softly textured wine. Shy on the nose yet powerful on the palate, it offers a burst of tightly wound tannin and leather at the fore. Chocolate and dried herb with a layering of black licorice give it a dark complexion and build. Be sure to mellow it in the cellar, through 2022.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from the Cold Creek vineyard. Smooth and fruit forward, it's done in a seamless, accessible, ready-to-drink style that makes it difficult to put down. A fair amount of vanilla flavor comes through, accenting a consumer (and consumption) friendly style.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of white peach and vanilla highlight this rich-textured, rather full-bodied white wine. It's made in a generous rather than crisp style, as if it were barrel fermented, and a buttery lushness defines it more than the fairly subtle fruit flavors. Very tasty overall.",US-California:Viognier

"This 100% varietal wine from Lewis and Wallula vineyards beguiles with its aromas of vanilla bean, butterscotch, baking spice, cherry and cinnamon.

"Thick, soft and heavy, this Merlot has medicinal cherry and blackberry flavors.",US-California:Merlot
"Ripe raspberries, plump alpine strawberries and cranberry-cola notes meet with shaved cinnamon, pencil lead and dried sage on the nose of this single vineyard expression. The flavors are focused on woody red fruits, with chaparral scrub highlights as well as bay leaf and juniper. It's relatively light but well layered.",US-California:Grenache
"This is a beautiful, classic 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon, but it's also immature in hard tannins, which is a telltale mark of this mountain appellation.

"Fresh-pressed blackberry, cedar, dark-chocolate shavings, charcoal and espresso grounds show on this slightly wound up, extremely dark wine. Coffee flavors come through strongly on the thick and sticky palate, where powerful acidity unleashes blueberries and dried herbs. It's a mouthful for certain.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"Delicate black-skinned berry and baking spice scents lift out of the glass. The dense, ripe palate offers dried black cherry, white pepper and leather notes, framed by mature tannins. Drink through 2021.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"A very subdued expression of the normally flamboyant Gewürztraminer grape, the opening notes are of wool and mineral. The full-bodied palate has accents of candied orange rind and toast. Good for those who can't deny Gewürz's ability to flatter Asian food, but who prefer a more subtle wine.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"This has a bright yellow-gold color and subtle aromas of honey, pear and fig. The rather rich texture supports pear, fig and baking spice flavors. It's a pleasantly ripe, somewhat soft but not overtly flavored wine that's easy to drink and enjoy.",US-California:Chardonnay

"Consulting winemaker Charlie Hoppes has imprinted his benchmark style on Gamache fruit. This is a big, ripe, blocky but powerful wine—all Merlot as only Washington State can grow it. The ripe cassis fruit is enveloped in a mix of French and American oak, half new, yielding strong flavors of smoke, tobacco and mocha. A blockbuster style, ready to drink right now.",US-Washington:Merlot
"This is a full-flavored Pinot Noir, brimming with cherry, cola, red licorice and earthier notes of sautéed wild mushrooms and spices. It's quite low in alcohol, which preserves the airy, silky texture you want in a nice Pinot. It's also a young wine. Give it six years in the cellar.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Made entirely from Cabernet Sauvignon, this has aromas of black-skinned berry, leather and cedar. The dense palate delivers black currant, espresso and clove alongside bracing tannins that leave a somewhat astringent finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Muted aromatics frame the entry of this wine, a concentration of baked raspberry and blackberry at its core. Smooth and soft, with minimal presence of oak, it's a fairly elegant expression of the grape.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"Held back probably to tame fierce acidity, and it's still a young, lean, tart wine. Fresh, juicy flavors of lemons drink very clean and vibrant, but it's austere stuff. Try with goat cheese on toast.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This is light and rusty in color—evidence of a mature wine that's ready to drink now. The nose is spicy, dry and earthy, with tomato, nutmeg and tobacco aromas. The mouthfeel is snappy and drying, with reserved flavors of cocoa, cherry and plum. Spice, tomato and herbal tobacco flavors carry the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"Here's a Merlot-like Zinfandel, in terms of the silky mouthfeel, the elegance of the tannins, and the cherry and currant flavors that have a flowery, violet finish. But the black pepper, clove and nutmeg spices are all Zin. Drink this lovely wine now.",US-California:Zinfandel

"From the Zamora region, this Tempranillo is dark, well oaked and dense. The nose is full of black cherry and charred oak that gives off a shoe polish scent. The palate is round and smooth, with oak-dominated black fruit and minty, spicy flavors. A modern, meaty wine by any measure. Drink now through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Scents of seaweed, espresso, smoke and chocolate-covered raisins are followed by comparable flavors. This has a sharp, volatile edge that translates as vinegary in the finish.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"This golden-hued sparkler opens with aromas of yellow orchard fruit, citrus and a whiff of bread crust that carry over to the crisp palate along with a nutty note. A firm, persistent perlage offsets the ripe fruit flavors.",Italy-Lombardy:Sparkling Blend
"A bit heavy and creamy, but there's something exotic about the oily, fat richness that suggests cashew nuts. With Meyer lemon flavors, it's an unctuous wine, and a very good value.",US-California:Chardonnay

"Nicely structured, with citrus fruits (lemon, lime, pink grapefruit) displayed against stiffer flavors of skin. There is a hint of residual sugar, and the alcohol is just under 13%, but the overall impression is a dry, tight style with little or no floral character.",US-Washington:Riesling
"Creamy notes of Red Delicious apple are tinged with hints of shortbread on the nose. These become more forward on the creamy palate as the frothy mousse amplifies them. This is dry, restrained and elegant with a wonderfully refreshing finish.",France-Alsace:Pinot Noir
"Full marks to Moncontour for indicating on the label that this is a dry wine (not always the case in Vouvray). In 2007, that dryness translates into a dominant acidity, fresh apple flavors and a texture of lemon zest. It is a crisp wine, either to be drunk now or aged for 4–5 years for the secondary flavors to develop.",France-Loire Valley:Chenin Blanc
"A good Pinot Noir for the price, showing classy Central Coast dryness and acidity. The raspberry, cherry, cola and spice flavors pair well with smoked meats, grilled steak, or just a great juicy burger.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"A whiff of reduction still hangs over this wine. After a few vigorous swirls, smoky blueberries and peppery plums are revealed on a slender, elegant and unforced palate. This is gentle and lithe, but aromatically beguiling. A true reflection of the vintage with overtones of white pepper and all the more beautiful for it.",Austria-Burgenland:Blaufränkisch
"This tart, plush and broadly appealing wine is fruit-forward and rounded with red cherry, cola and vanilla flavors.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A full, rich and rounded wine that brings out the concentration from the low yielding old vines. It has rich black cherry and spice flavors that go with the delicious acidity and solid structure.

"Bella Vida replaces the Abbey Ridge bottling and does so with pizzazz. The best of the 2011 releases, this is a beautiful expression of grapes grown on red clay soils, with refined, deeply penetrating flavors of ripe raspberries.

Ancilla is a rustic and raw expression of Montepulciano with a point of dried apple skin followed by bright cherry and raspberry. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy with bright acidity on the close.,Italy-Central Italy:Montepulciano

"Citrusy bright, with a core of red and black cherry, this simply structured, light-bodied wine shows well-defined acidity and a touch of forest floor.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Quite good, but some vegetal flavors mar this dessert wine, which is very sweet, with 18% residual sugar. Such sweetness is usually enough to satisfy on its own, but despite the apricot, tangerine and vanilla flavors, a stubborn green streak lowers the score.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Minerality is front and center on this bottling, with concentrated pencil lead the focus, backed up by sandalwood and dried rose petals but no overt fruit.

"Mauro will always show you a lot, but frankly this 2005 seems soft and chunky. It has rich, baked, black-fruit aromas and then a mildly syrupy palate with huge blackberry and cassis flavors.

"Deep garnet in color, with dark amber highlights. There's loads of intensity here, with ripe, syrupy fruit, blackberry preserves, prune and dark plum.

This is truly a natural wine, fermented with no additives, aged on the lees for 18 months, and bottled unfined and unfiltered. Deeply rich flavors of apple pastry, buttery barrel and sweet spice are ineffably long and seductive. This rare and exceptional wine should be consumed in its youth.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay

"A recommended entry-level Ribera, with aromas of violets, minerals and oak. The palate has a standard, competent feel and balance along with flavors of gangly berry fruit and black cherry.

The freshness of the fruit flavors and crispness of the mouthfeel are pluses.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"From grapes that were just touched by noble rot, this dry wine is a beautiful, golden wine in color and flavor. It feels full, with mature yellow fruits, the merest hint of honey, but always rich rather than showing any sweetness. A very fine, unusual wine.",France-Loire Valley:Chenin Blanc

"This wine knocks the flavors out of the park again this vintage, with spicy grapefruit and pine needle notes leading the charge. Think more cool fruit—lime flesh and skin—than tropical flavors.

"Ripe white peach and sharp lime peel qualities interplay on the nose of this bottling from the iconic vineyard, which is now under the quality-focused ownership of the Foley family. That lime zest comes through on the palate too, cutting through the creamy midpalate and adding a pinpoint edge to the finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Flat aromas include iodine, butterscotch and cider, but overall the nose isn't that lively or fresh. The palate, meanwhile, is round, soft and mealy, with oaky, barrel-fermented flavors of buttered baked apple and resin.

"Winemaker Heidi Barrett was making Moscato way before the current craze started, so you can call her a visionary. Her 2011, an unusual blend of fruit from Napa Valley and Paso Robles, is a real crowd pleaser. Tasted in May of 2012, it's a little spritzy, which gives a nice, clean edge to the orange, vanilla and white flower flavors. While it's dry, there's a rich edge of honey. The alcohol is a refeshingly low 12.8% by volume.",US-California:Moscato

The wine spent 22 months in 100% new French oak, yet the barrel notes seem muted, and the intense fruit is certainly up to the challenge.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine is robust in flavor, appropriately laced with firm tannins and begs for a dry-aged Tbone to pair with. It has a deep color, moderately spicy blackberry aromas, and a firm mouthfeel. Blackberry and subtle blueberry flavors push through on the finish. Best after 2022.",US-California:Petite Sirah

A mild streak of vanilla in both the aroma and flavor provides most of the taste and a smooth texture. Modest apple and honey flavors turn up on the finish. It's medium-bodied and soft in balance.,US-California:Fumé Blanc
"A hugely dense wine, with immense ripe black fruit and dusty tannins. The wine is balanced, rich and structured at the same time. Powered by a dark core, the wine has weight, intensity and a solid long-term future.",Portugal-Port:Port
"Quite earthy in profile with hints of smoke, petroleum and fresh green herbs, there's a distinct minerality in this off-dry Riesling that's compelling. Brisk lime-juice acidity and a hint of citrus rind bitterness accentuates the dry finish.",US-New York:Riesling
"Rather closed aromas burn off in the glass to reveal mature black berry fruit and cooking spices. The palate delivers stewed plums, espresso and toasted oak alongside bracing tannins. Enjoy soon with four-cheese gnocchi.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"How can such lightness, such supple slenderness, come with such full flavor? Visions of swirling citrus are made manifest here. Mandarin, kumquat, tangerine: they all dance and flit around a central seam of freshness. Lovely and almost irresistible now, but sure to advance most gracefully.",Austria-Kamptal:Riesling
"Most of the grapes in this statewide blend came from Lodi and Paso Robles, and it has the character of a warm-climate Zin. Soft and delicious, the flavors are of cherries, black raspberries, chocolate truffle, licorice, cloves and smoky vanilla.",US-California:Zinfandel
This wine has some pleasant layers of black cherry and tea yet is marred by its unresolve between being thin and overly oaked. The earthiness on display is on the funky side of things.,US-California:Pinot Noir
"This ruby-colored Amarone offers medium intensity and sightly disjointed aromas of spice, leather and candied fruit. The nicest element, however, is the crisp cherry freshness that peeps through on the finish.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This is a thin and easygoing Aglianico with informal aromas of warm berries and Indian spice. Unlike other robust red wines from Puglia, this expression lacks the overt ripeness you sometimes find. Instead, you get sharp aromas of sour berry and underbrush.",Italy-Southern Italy:Aglianico
This is a seriously wood-aged wine. Its burnt toast character doesn't chime with the light fruitiness of the vintage and so gives a wine that is bitter and extracted. Less overworking would have produced a better wine.,France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This soft wine is gentle, rounded and immediately accessible. Its lightly crisp acidity shows in the lemon fruitiness and in a zingy texture. The wine is ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley:Melon
"A blend of 60% Montepulciano and 40% Sangiovese, this is a grippy, leathery wine, the fruit sourced from two different sites in the appellation. Black leather, baked and dried plum, and cherry combine on the palate with breadth and length, finishing as if dusted in cocoa.",US-California:Red Blend
"A smooth and ripe wine with tropical fruits as well as more crisp apple. It is ripe wine, full in the mouth with a final perfumed acidity. Give it another six months.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese White
"Fragrant blue flower, rose, new leather, cake spice and wild berry aromas set the tone on this classic Barolo. On the full-bodied, savory palate, solid tannins wrap around a juicy cherry-raspberry core while notes of cinnamon and clove add depth. Drink 2019–2028.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Ciel du Cheval, Klipsun, Obelisco and Quintessence make up this wine. The aromas of smoke, dark plum, cocoa, herb and spice lead to black-fruit flavors that show a sense of sophistication. There's no question it comes from a warm vintage and region but it shows a judicious touch.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"To celebrate its 1843 origins, Besserat de Bellefon has released this limited-edition wood-fermented wine. It is a classic yet exceptional blend of Chardonnay/Pinot Noir/Pinot Meunier from eight cru vineyards. The taste is ripe and rich, with the wood treatment reducing the acidity while filling out the fruit. A complex wine, it will repay further bottle aging.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"An aromatic, fruit-forward wine with notes of black cherry cola and brambly berries. It's soft and sumptuous in feel, full of fruit flavors and loaded with appeal.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Slightly sour red plum, red cherry, tar and dust show on the nose of this simple wine. More tar and rubber flavors arise on the palate, where light red fruit also emerges.",US-California:Red Blend
"The blend of 40% Grenache Blanc, 28% Viognier, 20% Picpoul Blanc, and 12% Roussanne hits the nose with minerality and citrus, wound tightly around tangerine peel. The flavors are almost all lime zest and chalk, making for a brisk pre-dinner drink or perfect shellfish partner.",US-California:Rhône-style White Blend
"This is a big, dark wine. It is full of dense tannins and ripe black fruits. The tarry, leathery texture is developing well alongside the black-skinned plum fruits that are cut by intense acidity. Nothing is reticent about this powerful wine. It will be ready to drink from 2019.",France-Southwest France:Tannat-Cabernet
"Here's one of those rare California Chards that needs time. The wine is tight, tough and minerally in its youth, with an austerity of flavors suggesting Meyer lemons, nectarines and flint. Bone dry and crisp, it should blossom between 2008 and 2015, with proper cellaring.",US-California:Chardonnay
"A good wine for its classic structure and deep, complex black currant and cocoa flavors. But it's pretty oaky and tannic, giving it a hard, resistant feeling despite being nearly four years in age. Could surprise with up to 6 years in the cellar.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Deep purple fruits, black sage, big cherry and woody spices arise from this wine by Adam Lee, who recently sold to Jackson Family Wines but will remain in charge. The palate shows crushed clove and allspice, licorice, graphite and more dark fruit flavors.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This Verdejo is fruity and tropical on the bouquet. In the mouth, it's plump and smooth, with just enough acidic bite to keep things zesty. Flavors of melon, peach and pear finish solid and fairly long.",Spain-Northern Spain:Verdejo
"Pieropan's basic Soave Classico offers refreshing aromas of stone fruit, honeysuckle, grapefruit and lime. The wine is light and crisp with tonic acidity on the close and an easy, direct approach.",Italy-Veneto:Garganega
"This smooth, rich wine shows both ripe fruit and wood aging flavors. It has a mineral texture, plenty of citrus as well as pear and peach flavors, the whole gathered into toastiness. It would benefit from another year, so drink from 2015.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese White
"This wine needs to be decanted. At first the scents and flavors of green produce abound, and the fruit is masked. After some hours, it begins to show more fruit and less of the vegetal flavors, but remains a bit sharp and short.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Wet river rock and struck flint notes accentuate the sharp, tangy vitality of this razor-edged Kabinett. Zesty white grapefruit, lime and tangerine flavors penetrate deeply on the midpalate, finishing long but lean. It drinks beautifully already but should hold well through 2022.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"Fresh apple, pear and tangerine flavors revitalize the palate in this crisp, approachable Sauvignon Blanc. It's uncomplicated yet elegant, finishing on a penetrating streak of lemon-lime acidity.",US-New York:Sauvignon Blanc
"Dry, tannic and bursting in dusty red fruit, this is a majority varietal with 20% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon. Brawny and broodingly full bodied, it finishes leathery and smoky.",US-California:Cabernet Franc
"Sleek and sappy, this was fermented with native yeast and aged nine months in 50% new French oak. There's a spine of iron keeping it a bit stiff and compact, with concentrated fruit flavors of crème de cassis. Still young and slightly grapey, it's best to cellar it a few more years, for a drinking window of 2020 to 2030.",US-Oregon:Syrah
"This winery does an excellent job of providing a range of styles in their single-vineyard bottlings. In this case, richness is on display, with aromas of concentrated lemon cream, buttered toast and a bit of crushed chalk. Strong yellow-apple and melon flavors show on the sip as well as a jasmine and gardenia elements and a butterscotch finish. Fairly unctuous and loose in texture.",US-California:Chardonnay

This is ripe and fruity with attractive red-fruit flavors and a touch of tannins to keep it all in place. The wine is soft with just a layer of tannin and plenty of red cherries at the end.,France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Green grass and gooseberry flavors accent flavors of sweet spearmint chewing gum and Key-lime pie on this Napa Sauvignon Blanc. There's bright acidity, though, making it a good companion to Southeast Asian cuisine.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Like many of the Perrin & Fils wines, this one is firmly structured, its cherry and cocoa flavors ending on a dusty, tannic note. But the fruit is attractive, and even boasts some complexity in the wisps of garrigue on the nose. Probably best from 2013–2017.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"This wine displays aromas of tobacco, cracked black pepper, clove and mineral. It's elegant in style with tart fruit flavors and lightly chalky tannins.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Cabernet Sauvignon (45%) and Cabernet Franc (42%) take the lead on this blend. The aromas suggest notes of dried herb, cherry, vanilla and pencil shavings while the palate offers elegantly styled dark-fruit flavors with toasty accents. It's a very pretty expression of the vintage.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This luxury bottling spends nine months in barrel, yet shows little overt oak. It's full, ripe and opulent without going over the top, boasting aromas and upfront flavors of honeydew, apricot and bergamot. Then the long, mouthwatering finish folds in hints of honey and pineapple without any hint of bitterness.",France-Rhône Valley:Viognier
This is a simple and fresh Italian sparkler that offers white flower and peach backed by citrus and almond. A touch of soft sweetness adds a chewy spot that is followed by creamy mousse.,Italy-Veneto:Glera
"This nicely captures the complexity and earthiness of Washington Syrah, without becoming too heavy. Raspberry fruit is backed by earthy flavors and peppery herb, nicely integrated with nothing obtrusive. This is not the sweet and jammy style of Syrah you find in California, but it has a lot to offer if you give it a good look.",US-Washington:Syrah
"This wine seems barely ripe, with thin, herbal, almost vegetal flavors and a sour streak. The barrel aging may have contributed some suggestions of vanilla and licorice.",US-Washington:Syrah
"The Corton hill has a number of red Grand Cru sites, including Vergennes, which lies at the western end. The wine has power, although its more dominant character is richness. It's packed with red fruits, laced with dark tannins and spice, and freshened with black currant acidity. It's a wine for aging, drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"The Merlot in this blend allows for a wine that is smooth and less formidably tannic than some Cahors, while not losing the weight of Malbec. It makes this fruity, black-fruit flavored wine ready to drink and attractive.",France-Southwest France:Malbec-Merlot
"This rich wine, produced from old vines, is dense and concentrated. It does have the fruitiness of the vintage but that is allied to the dark-black fruit and powerful tannins. There are spice and wood flavors still developing. Drink this fine wine from 2020.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"You almost have to classify this Riesling as a dessert wine, because it crosses the line from off-dry into frankly sweet. It's an easy sipper, with honeyed tangerine and pear flavors. Could be a little brighter in acidity, though.",US-California:Riesling
"From the Basarin vineyard area in the village of Neive, this shows power and finesse in its typical Nebbiolo sensations of underbrush, floral notes and truffle. The palate has creamy dark-cherry fruit layered with spices and balsamic herbs and a long finish. It will develop fully over the next few years and should age well.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"An impressive wine from this St. Helena winery, with the vineyard below Howell Mountain. It's rich and classic, showing ripe blackberry, blueberry, currant and earthy flavors, with wonderfully thick, refined tannins. An elaborate, Cabernet that should benefit from up to six years in the cellar.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Hints of pine needle and sage lend a refreshingly herbaceous note to this crisp, dry Riesling. The mousse is delicately structured, with a creamy mouthfeel cut by a strike of lemon acidity.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"The scent of very fragrant ripe apples abounds on the nose: think both Red and Golden Delicious. This fruity note carries through the entire palate: from its fresh, sprightly opening through its dry, slender body to its frothy, lively finish.",France-Alsace:Pinot Noir
"Dry in style but lusciously textured, this full-bodied Riesling stands out for its luminous ripeness. Layers of honey and decadent citrus and peach flavors are calibrated neatly by zesty acidity and notes of sweet spice and pollen. It's unctuously concentrated with a long, deeply penetrating finish.",Germany-Rheingau:Riesling
"This full-bodied, Rhône-style blend from winemaker Matt Cline gives a blast of dark, jammy fruit flavors that are nicely concentrated and persistent on the palate and through the finish. Firm tannins match the power of the fruit, lending an appetizing grip to the otherwise rich mouthfeel.",US-California:Red Blend
"This is a beautiful, ripe, soft, perfumed wine. Its intense berry fruit is well to the fore, backed by firm tannins. Packed with fruit and smokiness from wood aging, it has strong aging potential. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"From one of the most ocean-adjacent vineyards in the state, this is a swarthy and powerful bottling, showing black plum, violet, olive and coffee touches on the concentrated nose. There is a bracing acidity and upright structure to the palate, while the flavors remain power-driven: stewed plum and hoisin sauce, with an espresso-like finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Fruity and soft, this appealing wine is ready to drink. Lemon juice and lime zest give freshness along with bright acidity and a light sense of mineral texture.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese White

"This salmon-colored wine is powdery on the nose, with aromatic hints of apple skins and raspberry. The palate feels lean, pinched and rubbery, while flavors of pithy citrus fruits finish chalky, with some tang.",Spain-Northern Spain:Rosé
"This is a lovely, age-worthy wine that sings in earthy tobacco, black pepper and leather before revealing balanced acidity and a light background of its 20 months in French oak, 40% of it new. Made by Gary Brookman, it finishes awash in cherry and chocolate. Drink now through 2022.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Soft, velvety and fruity, with chocolate, black raspberry, currant and oak flavors this blend is spiced up with white pepper and cinnamon notes. Drink this hearty wine with stews, barbecue or pasta.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"A big but not-too-tannic Petit Verdot, this is juicy and structured with red fruit and a light layer of spice. Tending toward black licorice and dark chocolate, it could use a splash of something to brighten it up. But it's otherwise a bottle worth trying if you're curious to try a varietal Petit Verdot.",US-California:Petit Verdot
"Subtlety and reserve drive this full-bodied, round-textured white Rhône-style blend. The velvety mouthfeel is almost more notable than the subdued pear, melon and butter flavors. It's a wine for lingering over, because it reveals its best stuff after time in the glass. It leads with 49% Marsanne, plus Viognier, Roussanne and Grenache Blanc.",US-California:White Blend
"Light, high-toned aromas of potting soil and purple flowers are followed by lemon-twist flavors and a wall of burly tannins. It's a bit brusque on its own but will show better with food.",US-Washington:Petit Verdot
"This is an elaborate wine that's dense, complex and immensely enjoyable. It has a fleshy, meaty quality, like a buttery veal piccata, alongside ripe white and yellow fruits. There's a firm, minerally quality, highlighted by crisp acidity, and the finish is bone dry. Gets more interesting as it warms up in the glass. One of the best examples of Roussanne out there.",US-California:Roussanne

While it lacks its usual complexity, it's juicy, delicious and extremely accessible. Drink 2015–2019.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese

"It's nice to see the quality of this wine reach new heights, as it's still relatively affordable within the Henschke context. The blend includes Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. The 2013 shows a slightly austere side, an aristocratic reserve, but the flavors are classic. Pencil shavings, mint, cassis and cigar box finish with great drive, length and dusty tannins. Drink 2023–2035.",Australia-South Australia:Red Blend
"A superbly rich and creamy wine, powered by ripe Pinot Noir, with elegance and élan. The wine is concentrated, powerful, packed with intense white fruit flavors and citrus. For aging.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine was grown on the warmer slopes of Sonoma Mountain, a less known but respected part of Sonoma County. It's dry and firm in tannins, with rich flavors of blackberries, currants, mocha and oak. Flashy and delicious now, it should gain in the bottle over the next six years.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a wine in development. It has lost its primary fruit and not yet found its way to maturity. While there are citrus and green herb flavors, they are overshadowed by a closed, steely edge. Wait a few years, and drink from 2016.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"Extremely dark in the glass, lavish aromas of black currant, black pepper, lilac, violet and blooming chaparral show on this bottling from a remote vineyard north of the Santa Maria Valley. It's a smooth sip at first, with ripe elderberry and black fruit, but the tannins stiffen quickly to reveal a masculine wine, with peppery spice, rounded vanilla and a strong acidic slice cutting through the density.",US-California:Syrah
"Espresso, dark chocolate, herb and purple fruit aromas lead to a soft, smooth palate in this wine. Fruit and barrel notes play equal parts, yet it comes up short on the finish.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Whispy and lightweight on the nose, with hints of celery, sweat and passion fruit. There's not a ton to say about this pedestrian but well-made Sauvignon. It is citrusy with a touch of bell pepper, and it finishes in a comfortable way. Classic everyday SB from Casablanca is what this tastes, smells and feels like.

"A gritty but well-made wine with aromas of crushed brick, red pepper flake, earth and sandalwood.

"Fruity, savory and lightly oaky flavors are supported by moderate tannins in this medium-bodied and well-balanced blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Mint, cedar and thyme aromas give way to red cherry, raspberry and sage flavors on the palate, and the mouthfeel strikes a balance between suppleness and a light tannic bite.",US-California:Meritage
"This wine was made by fermenting the skins and juice of several white Rhône varieties and Rolle, also known as Vermentino, together. It has a brassy color and more textural elements than usual for a white. Orange peel and toasted almond aromas are followed by dry white peach and white pepper flavors and a firm mouthfeel due to some tannin. With time, it opens up and tastes wonderful in an unorthodox way. Best after 2020.",US-California:White Blend

"This is the first vintage of the winery's flagship wine to receive a vineyard designation. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (61%), Merlot (24%), Merlot and Petit Verdot, it offers brooding aromas of dried herbs and tobacco along with coffee and barrel spice. The style is reserved but it still brings a lot of richness along with lively acidity, exceptional balance, well-integrated tannins and a lengthy finish.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Biodynamically farmed Momtazi Vineyard is a favorite of several high-end Willamette Valley producers.

It finishes elegantly, with a slick of honeycomb and lavender perfume. Drink now for its floral, fruity decadence.",Germany-Rheingau:Riesling
"They pulled out all the stops on this white Burgundy-inspired Chard. It tastes quite leesy, with a Champagne-like yeastiness riding over the tropical fruit and oaky, caramelized flavors. Complex and intriguing, this unfined, unfiltered Chard should drink well for the next few years.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This small-lot Cab (350 cases) is classically Chilean at all check points. The nose is spicy and full of cassis and berry flavors along with tobacco, olive and mild eucalyptus notes.

"This blend of Syrah and Touriga Nacional is rustic with some hard tannins and intense acidity. Since it is still young, the wine could soften but it seems to be more about its structure than its fruit.",Portugal-Lisboa:Portuguese Red
"Jammy, concentrated aromas of boysenberry, violet petal and oak spice are about as rich and lusty as Rioja gets. This wine from a warm vintage is lush and lusty but less structured than other vintages. Jammy blackberry and blueberry flavors end in a jammy fashion. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
A strong streak of pure vanilla highlights the flavors here. The fruit tastes of fresh-picked strawberries. This is 100% Syrah made from estate-grown fruit.,US-Washington:Syrah

The vivid freshness and tangy texture sets it apart from the crowd, and it will work wonderfully with foods from raw oysters to roast chicken.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a delicious, ripe wine inspired by its Sémillon and Viognier. The lemon and grapefruit acidity is contrasted with the rich white stone fruits and warmth of this region. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese White
"This spent 18 months in 50% new French oak, which underscores its pretty berry/cherry fruit with a vein of dark chocolate. Dr Pepper and spicy herbs decorate a solid midpalate that flows into a lengthy finish with confectionary highlights.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"From an historic site replanted and restored to new heights, this wine has good grip and high-octane fruit that plays on the palate, veering from jammy to juicy and back again. Anise and black pepper linger on the lengthy finish, with a touch of smoky oak and toffee.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Aromas of cocoa and coffee are mixed with black licorice and dark berries, with this wine showing some reduction out of the gate that detracts. The flavors are rich and full bodied, carrying some warmth on the finish. The aromas and flavors seem disconnected.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Opening with a mouthful of dusty raspberry and cherry flavors, this Bordeaux blend of a little more than half Cabernet Sauvignon and smaller percentages of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot offers much in the way of inviting fruit and spice notes. Its pleasing acidity lasts through the finish.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This features plum, berry and leather aromas that are accented by a hint of lemon. It feels narrow and drawing, with black fruit, herb and carob flavors. The finish, which doesn't taste green or herbal, is better and wider.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Carmenère
"There are strong elements of the wood aging in this structured wine. That gives it a dry character that still dominates the red fruits. It needs to develop. While it will always have a dry character, look for the fruit to shine with its berry flavors and acidity. Wait to drink until 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"With this 2008, Taz brings to the table a wonderful Chardonnay at a great price. It's dry and crisply acidic, with bright, perky flavors of oranges, peaches, Meyer lemons and smoky vanilla. Really nice and clean, a lovely wine and a good restaurant by-the-glass selection. Production was 9,000 cases.",US-California:Chardonnay

"Butterscotch and candle wax aromas signal a wine in the early stages of decline. In addition, this shows dusty apple and mild citrus scents. The palate is being kept upright by citrusy acidity, while flavors of nectarine and citrus end with bready, aged notes. Drink immediately or wait for the 2012.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño

"Coming from vineyards scattered across the Wahluke Slope, this immediately charming wine has aromas of mocha, coffee, plum, herbs and assorted barrel spices. The sweet blue fruit flavors are soft and bring plenty of appeal.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Wearing a heavy mantle of rather green, not-too-subtle oak, the fruit in this wine struggles to be noticed. Faintly apple, with earthy notes, it is fairly buried, and the wine lacks the life and dimension on the palate one seeks in a wine with reserve status.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Chardonnay
"The lightest of Sea Smoke's trio of Pinots, the '05 Botella starts with ravishing aromas of red fruit confections like cherry pies and raspberry tarts, with notes of gingerbread and cinnamon sugar. Tastes as good as it smells, just a deliciously gentle, pure Pinot Noir. Good now, but the grippy tannins suggest midterm ageability.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is a smooth, dry and well-integrated white, highlighted in apricot, peach and lemongrass, with an herbal undertone. It's ready for the table, with food-friendly acidity and medium body weight.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"This vineyard-designated wine includes 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Syrah. The Syrah component seems to take over, in the form of tart berry, herb and dried leaf flavors. The alcohol, which is 15.5%, mutes any other complexities. It's a nice wine, but it doesn't offer standard Washington Merlot flavors.",US-Washington:Merlot

"Splendid from the gun, and classy. Early aromas of hard spices, mineral and matchstick announce some young oak, but that shortly dissipates, revealing a tight cherry and dark-chocolate bouquet. This model Brunello is impeccably balanced through the palate and onto the finish, which features a huge mix of pepper, licorice, baked fruit and vanilla. Hold at least until 2006.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese

"Artadi's top wine is dynamite in a bottle. Ripe, saturated, oaky aromas of blackberry, leather, blueberry pie and aged cheese are incredibly potent and alluring.

Best from 2016 through 2026.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend

"This powerful Pinot is not for the meek or easily afraid. It's a heavyweight in its prime, stemmy and unabashedly full-throttled in juicy Bing cherry, blackberry and raspberry. Though generous in style, it remains coiled in acidity, with springtime aromas of just-picked rose, proving beauty can come in a substantial package.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"This has bright raspberry and almost-sweet blackberry flavors, full body, moderate tannins and a long warm finish. It tastes polished, soft and satiny smooth.",US-California:Zinfandel

"This is a different beast from most other Zins, shy and intriguing in tight, dusty, high-toned raspberry and cassis, the spicy components leaning toward exotic cardamom and nutmeg.

Drink now–2020.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Tastes brittle and aloof in its youth, with a very dry mouthfeel dominated by acidity and tannins, although the texture is silky and smooth. You don't want to open this too soon.

"Syrah is not new in Southern Oregon, but finding a consistent style has been a battle. Progress is being made. Tannins are tamed, alcohol is kept in hand, and the fruit is plenty ripe; maybe just a bit too ripe. Here the flavors are of strawberry preserves, leafy herbs, and lighter but still-astringent tannins. The wine fades fairly quickly, and should be consumed in its youth.",US-Oregon:Syrah

"Lots of zesty acidity in this Syrah. Maybe too much, as it's so tart, it distracts attention from the flavors. But what flavors they are.

"A bold Chardonnay that embraces new oak barrels and has the flavor profile to show for it. Hovey fermented it in 50% new oak barrels, matured it on the lees and bottled it a few months after harvest. The scent and flavor of toasted oak comes through from the first sniff to the finish. But enough fruit, butter and almond flavors lie beneath the toasty overlay to make us come back for another sip.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This young wine needs some time in the cellar. Released at the age of two years, it's mouthwatering in acidity with fresh, juicy cranberry, raspberry jam and persimmon flavors that finish spicy and long. The alcohol is refreshingly low, adding to the delicate mouthfeel. Drink 2017 and beyond.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A heady and rich wine right from the start, this opens with seductive notes of brambly blackberry, wild raspberry, sweet spice, licorice and toast. It's full and weighty, with a texture like crushed velvet and a deep palate that continues to provide additional layers of flavor with each sip. Sweet spice, cocoa powder and mocha flavors linger on the evolving finish. Drink from 2017-2020. Monsieur Touton Selection Ltd, Dalbavie Selection LLC.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Smells damp and murky, with raisin and other sweet berry aromas along with some mulch. The palate brings more freshness, but it's grabby and tannic as it delivers prune, raisin and berry flavors in front of coffee and herbs on the finish. Good but smells and tastes a little overripe.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"It's dry, with just-in-time acidity brightening pleasant raspberry, red currant and sandalwood flavors. As it warms in the glass, certain instabilities emerge. It's not an ager.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This méthode Champenoise blend of 76% Pinot Noir and 24% Chardonnay impresses with its inviting mousse of peach and strawberry. It's fresh and lush, aged on the lees for three years, giving it body without an overabundance of alcohol. Dry, it finishes with a twist of candied orange peel.",US-California:Sparkling Blend

Drink now–2020.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Chardonnay
"Butter, pain grillé and roasted nut aromas expand on the palate into honey, peach and tangerine flavors, accented by citrus and mineral notes. Spicy (white peppery) on the finish.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay

"While there was some bottle variation between two samples, this elegant Sauvignon Blanc highlights the variety's more mineral, smoky expressions. Despite six years of cellar aging, there's still plenty of crisp cutting lemon and green-apple flavors augmented by spine-tingling acidity and a long chalky finish.",US-New York:Sauvignon Blanc
"Coming from a downright hot vintage, this wine offers quite pure aromas of black currant and black fruit. The palate brings more of the same, giving a very pure unencumbered-by-new-oak look at Washington Cabernet. Lightly grippy tannins provide support.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a firmly structured, dark wine. It has black cherry and berry fruit, a solid core of tannins and tight acidity. With its dense character, there is every chance of this impressive wine aging well, yielding a more rounded wine. Drink from 2016.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red

"Creamy and nutty, this wine offers ample herbaceous qualities around muted melon and citrus, finishing with ample lift and refreshment.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Though not labeled as such, this 100% varietal all hails from Red Mountain, with the fruit coming from Klipsun (64%), Scooteney Flats and Tapteil vineyards. The aromas are brooding and locked up at present with notes of mineral, black currant, spice, pencil lead and blackberry. The fruit flavors are black as night, supported by firm but exceptionally well-integrated tannins. It will be at its best from 2023 to 2031 but should last well beyond that.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aged in a combination of concrete egg, stainless steel and new French oak, this winning white is a study in peach and apricot—it's incredibly inviting in both taste and aroma.

"Full bodied and definitely fruity without being sweet, this wine from Fulcrum comes straight at the taste buds with opulent black cherry and tart raspberry flavors on a vivid texture.

"This is a stunning and vibrant Barolo that defies the heat of the vintage thanks to 47-year-old vines, amazing terroir and noninvasive winemaking.

Drink after 2022.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Lots of raspberry, cherry, vanilla and new oak richness in this Pinot Noir, and it's dry and silky. Would score higher except for intrusive acidity that cuts through the mouth like a scalpel. That makes it unbalanced, even though it's delicious.",US-California:Pinot Noir
There's a slightly floral or soapy note that appears on the bouquet of this youthful expression of Nebbiolo. Smooth tannins are enhanced by crisp berry flavors.,Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo

"Made in a richer marzipan-laced style, this bottling shows browned butter, butterscotch and baked apples on the nose. The palate is a tad oily with strong browned-butter and green-apple flavors, but also very balanced, with the unctuous custard elements cut by tart citrus peels.",US-California:Chardonnay

"This Bordeaux-style blend is three fifths Cabernet Sauvignon, and one fifth each Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Winemaker Charlie Hoppes goes for a big-boned, oaky, deeply fruited style. The structure (tannins, acids, barrel flavors) is in place to support the dark, cassis fruit flavors. Highlights of violets, licorice and clean earth add welcome details.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A reductive note of rubber tire threads through the mélange of cherry cola, iron ore and red licorice flavors in this wine. The components have not yet integrated, leading to a finish marked by bitter skin and tannins. Give it another couple of years of bottle age before pulling the cork.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Bright in acidity, and powerful in flavor, this Chard oozes ripe pineapple, green apple, mineral, honeysuckle and spicy flavors. Totally dry, it's a little tight, and could develop some bottle complexity in a few years. Nice with Asian fare.",US-California:Chardonnay

"A small Pinot Noir, this is dry and vegetal, with modest cherry flavors.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Aromas pop, with notes of starfruit, cantaloupe, apple, butter and spice. The palate is broad with a lightly creamy feel, speckled throughout with cardamom notes.",US-Washington:Chardonnay

"Minty eucalyptus takes hold of this wine and never lets go, contributing in not favorable ways with an otherwise sour and tannic experience of overripe proportion.",US-California:Merlot
"This yellow-tinted blend of Friulano, Chardonnay, Viognier and Pinot Gris is classy and smoky on the nose, with no shortage of toasty oak. Core apple, melon and citrus flavors are rich and smooth, while this finishes round and full in body. Corte Friulano is really good for an oddball Argentine white blend.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:White Blend
"Focused flavors of mint and black currant come together in this distinctive Cabernet. There's a touch of oak too that adds spice, and the overall character is elegant. The wine will benefit from some aging to further integrate its parts.",South Africa-Stellenbosch:Cabernet Sauvignon

"A mature nose of cornbread and oxidized fruits suggests a wine older than this. A white blend, it features a multitude of grapes led by Viura. On the palate, acidity is the key ingredient, while a mix of oxidized apple, melon and corn flavors runs long on the finish. Drink through 2022.",Spain-Northern Spain:White Blend
"This is smooth, with creamed apple and pink grapefruit notes. Textured and concentrated, this has delicious pure fruit flavor that's contrasted with a touch of pepper and intense acidity. Screwcap.",Austria-Traisental:Grüner Veltliner

"Old vines from Russian River and Alexander valleys go into this spicy, briary, gamy Zin. There's a dark undercurrent of tar, pipe tobacco and smoke that runs through the finish. The fruit is subsumed to clove and tobacco flavors; best with strongly spiced grilled foods.",US-California:Zinfandel

Burnt cinnamon rounds out the finish.",US-Virginia:Cabernet Franc

"With an attractive toasty aroma, this wine is rich and delicious.

With apple, toast and lemon flavors it is dry and ready to drink.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"This is a good, everyday Pinot that's rich and sweet in berries and cherries, with plenty of oak to give it that buttered toast and vanilla deliciousness. Enjoy it now.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"At the age of about four years, the fruit on this wine is beginning to shift from primary blackberries and cherries to dried versions of the same. It's also picking up interesting mushroom and cured meat notes. But the tannins remain fierce, and there's some heat from alcohol. Its future seems limited",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Spanish broom, dried lychee, aromatic Mediterranean herb and balsamic notes are just some of the aromas of this multifaceted wine. The linear palate shows compelling depth, delivering layers of mature yellow apple, Bartlett pear, thyme, salvia and energizing mineral alongside still-bright acidity. This wine could go on for another several years at least. Drink through 2021.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Carricante

"This bright wine has red fruits, citrus and a light minerality, finishing crisply. Wait until late 2014 for it to open up.",France-Provence:Rosé
"This is a spicy wine, soft and open. Its tannins and red berry fruits have a diffuse character that takes away the focus of the wine. It will age quickly.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Not all of the new wines that we see from up and coming regions like Montsant are good. This one is a lean, burnt and minty offering with an odd baked, nutty character. Not up to standards.",Spain-Catalonia:Red Blend
"If there is any criticism to be made of this wine, it might be that it is just too fruity. Waves of honey and tropical fruit coat the mouth, wonderfully balanced by zesty acidity, and while it is sweet and lush it never seems cloying or heavy. Delicious now–2015, at least.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"This bottling has been variable over the years, but with the '06, Vina Robles seizes full command of Petite Sirah. Shows a classically thick, full-bodied texture, with dark currant, plum and licorice flavors edged with baker's chocolate. Fully dry, it's marvelous now with tri-tip, and should age for many years.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"This is a soft, fruity wine with a lively creamy mousse. Red fruits are cut with acidity that is still young. The wine really needs more time in bottle before it is drunk to allow the super-fresh character and final bitterness to soften. Palmer is the brand name for a grouping of seven growers.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Showing the brisk acidity of this cool coastal appellation, MacMurray's '05 Pinot is bright in red and black cherry, raspberry, cola, licorice, vanilla and smoky oak flavors. The wine isn't an ager, but it's a rich, fairly complex wine to drink now. Easy to find, with 25,000 cases produced.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This shows lots of Chardonnay charm and lusciousness. The texture is creamy and buttery, the flavors are suggestive of ripe pineapples and oranges, plus layers of vanilla and butterscotch are just right.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Overly sharp acidity marks this wine, giving it a cutting mouthfeel that interferes with otherwise delicious flavors. It sure is deep and long in blackberries, black currants, black licorice and smoky cedar wood, and the tannins are thick and dry, suggesting ageability.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Basic, fresh, honest aromas of red-berry fruits and spice set up a wide, easygoing palate with cassis, blackberry and herbal flavors. Only on the finish does one detect some acidity and rawness. Overall this is a nice Cab for casual drinking.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon

"It's rare to see an offering of this variety in Washington. This one comes from Lonesome Springs Vineyard.

The palate is medium bodied, with stone-fruit flavors that provide appeal.",US-Washington:Roussanne
"Powerful and complex, this is solid and impressive, made from a selection of wines. It is dark, dense, full of blackberry fruit and dry tannins. The wood aging still shows in the spiciness, while the tight fruit flavors bring out the acidity. Drink this wine from 2016.",Portugal-Lisboa:Portuguese Red
"The extra depth typical of Pouilly Fumé is here. It makes for a full-bodied and dense wine ripe with red apple, lemon and a tangy, orange-zest aftertaste. The wine is still developing and needs time. Drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Typically bright and floral-fruity, this offers up a big mouthful of lemonade, peach juice, and honeyed, wildlfower flavors. ItÕs creamy and rich, and really a lot of fun, a wine to enjoy, not ponder over.",US-California:Viognier
"Possesses some decent black-cherry aromas and flavors with leathery, earthy accents, but also a sour streak and a sulfurous note that refused to yield. The wine finishes dry, with some of the astringency shown by many 1998s.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Nutty and lush with layers of peach, pear and lime fruit, this is a medium-bodied and well-balanced white. It's refreshing while offering both length and breadth on the palate.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc

"Pithy citrus and an oily aromatic note give this white blend some funk on the nose. The palate is in good shape but typical in terms of feel and weight. Flavors of orange, papaya and mango finish with citrusy notes of lime as well as chalky minerality. This wine holds Parellada, Macabeo and Chardonnay.",Spain-Catalonia:White Blend
"Paso Robles-based Alma Sol reaches into Napa Valley for its Cabernet, with good results. The wine is dry, full-bodied and smooth, with rich flavors of blackberries, currants, dark chocolate and spices. Nice now, after a good decanting, and it should develop bottle complexities over 5–6 years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of roasted coffee bean, coconut and plum cake lead the nose on this dense wine. The extracted palate offers prune, oak, espresso, dried black fruit and licorice alongside astringent tannins that leave a bitter finish. There's not enough fruit richness to stand up to the oak.",Italy-Southern Italy:Primitivo
"Torrontes is something we've never seen from the Trumpeter line. And maybe that's good, seeing that this is oily in the mouth, with pithy, unusual flavors coming from all directions. It's a wine that doesn't stride along with ease.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Torrontés
"This wine makes you work harder than many of its neighbors to find the flavor but it's worth the effort when you uncover an intriguing mélange of hay, apricot and early summer fruits. The crisp, minerally finish puts one in mind of a platter of choucroute garnie. Drink now to 2013.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"This wonderful under-$20 Malbec opens with a blast of black-fruit aromas as well as mild rubber scents and minerality. The palate is solid, with baked berry and integrated saline and mineral flavors. A bright, lively finish with a ton of berry essence closes this out.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec

This wine offers an austere entry of crunchy red fruit akin to cranberry and pomegranate. Accents of clove and leather ride along toward a lengthy finish of broad expansion and balanced strength.,US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"The purest notes of ripe lemon zest are the first to rise from the glass, then comes a slight notion of yeast—so fresh is this wine. There is a savoury timbre on all this gleaming citrus sleekness, adding extra interest and verve. Utterly linear and driven, this will relax into a sleek, sound beauty with just a little more bottle age. Ready from summer 2016 and for at least a decade after.",Austria-Kremstal:Riesling
"Though it's relatively light for Syrah, this offers flavors that are true to classic varietal characteristics. Red and purple berries, anise and a vein of steel are all in the mix, and continue through a gentle fade-out.",US-Oregon:Syrah
"Note the vintage—2009. This is already moving into maturity, loaded with berry-pie fruit flavors, especially blueberry. It's soft and drinking well, with cinnamon and baking spices in abundance. Don't delay—enjoy it over the next couple of years.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"The palest of grey-pink rosés, this is classy, fresh and fragrant. It has a light, orange-zest texture as well as tannins and a mineral edge. Very fresh, it is also worth aging a few months.",France-Provence:Rosé
"This is a great success in a challenging vintage. Dry and silky in the mouth, it's marked by brisk acidity, firm tannins and intricate black-cherry, cola and licorice flavors. It feels really interesting and changes with every sniff and sip. Very nice now, and it will develop over the next six years.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Bright smells of freshly shredded lemongrass and orange blossom lift off of this Riesling that gets an aromatic boost from 11% Gewürztraminer. On the palate, it is smooth but slightly sweet, with orange soda flavors and a nice herbal twist of chamomile tea.",US-California:Riesling
"Berry and plum aromas smell a bit burnt, sort of like a burning field. A healthy lively medium-bodied palate delivers smoky oaky roasted berry and plum flavors in front of a lightly spiced finish.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A good Cabernet, but outclassed in a flight by its more concentrated and attractive competitors. Taste too fruity, in a jammy sense, and over-oaked, showing lots of upfront vanilla extract and buttered toast. Could well develop bottle character after 2012, but it's a dice throw.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's always lots of acidity in Pinots from the Edna Valley, but this one has more than usual, courtesy of the cool vintage. Although it's tart, it's entirely dry, and is loaded with raspberry and cherry fruit. It's silky enough to drink now and over the next few years.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"This wine, which is named after vintner Bill Foley's grandma, is quite light in the glass, and shows a lot of florals on the nose, along with strawberry syrup and brown spice. It's a little flat on the palate, yet suggests fresh raspberries and rose petals, proving a nice light and bright sipper that wouldn't overwhelm a fish dish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"From a section of the rocky vineyard planted to the Martini clone, a thick-skinned grape, Deer Camp is full bodied, densely concentrated and marked by a streak of spiciness throughout. It's perfumed with roses and forest floor, while it presents a texture that is seductively velvety and smooth.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A light-colored, delicate wine that is smooth and soft. It has a good balance of red-cherry flavors, with a little bitterness, layered over some gentle tannins. Not for aging, but attractively juicy now.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir

"Mineral, citrus and dusty aromas are textbook for brut Cava. A round, full palate shows good grip and acidity, while flavors of lemon-lime and nectarine finish with notes of lime and green banana. Nothing about this is overwhelming, but the sum of its parts add up.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"Aromatic and silky upon entry, this stylish Syrah brings dark berry fruit flavors laced with toast and smoked meats.

"Heavy and sweet, this wine has melted cherry-jam and Dr. Pepper flavors and some heat from the alcohol.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A rustic but mouthwatering red, with leather, clove and dark fruit notes delivered via a medium-bodied, slightly chunky mouthful. With its old school style, it has the rough edges to handle stews and braises.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Initially, this smells heavy, earthy, nutty and even a bit raisiny. In the mouth, this is chunky and rich, with pounding tannins. The flavor profile is much like a chocolate parfait, with sweet, nutty, spicy notes. On the finish, copious oak is reflected via clove, mint and wood-spice flavors. Drink this lush, sticky Carmenère through 2021.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Carmenère
"Impressive for its power, a wine of considerable interest and complexity. It's rich in black cherries, red currants, cola, bacon and spice flavors, but the texture really stands up, a combination of firm tannins and brilliant acidity. Oak provides complicating notes of sweet toast. Drink soon.",US-California:Syrah

"A smooth and rounded wine, its ripe plum and blueberry flavors well integrated into the soft tannins and sweet acidity. Drinkable now, but worth waiting for two more years.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, this is a bold, concentrated and flavorful wine that will mature well over the next 10 years. Aromas of espresso, crème de cassis, spiced blackberry, boysenberry preserves, tobacco and woodspice abound and carry through to the robust, gripping palate. It's firmly structured, but harmonious in it's overall strength, with final notes of campfire, char and cocoa on the long finish.",South Africa-Stellenbosch:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A nontraditional blend of 35% Zinfandel, 31% Merlot, 17% Grenache and 17% Petite Sirah, this offers cooked strawberry, sea-salt caramel candy, plum pudding and sweet violets on the nose. The palate shows more dry restraint, with black currant fruit and herbs of dill, oregano and marjoram.",US-California:Red Blend
"This follows the tried and true path of making Chardonnay with ripe fruit and plenty of creamy oak. The flavors are of apricots, oranges, sour lees and buttered toast.",US-California:Chardonnay

Dry and crisp, it remains lighthearted in the glass, finishing with a tease of grapefruit.",US-California:Rosé
"A splash of Malbec is included in this otherwise varietal wine, a grippy, structured and full-bodied mountain expression of big tannins and potent black fruit. Leather and tobacco make their way into the experience, finishing soft and on the way to being resolved.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Katnook's top Cabernet is always oaky, and the 2006 is no exception, featuring plenty of brown sugar and caramel aromas. Vanilla and cedar dominate the palate, forming an attractive wooden shell over cassis fruit. Drink it now if you like that sort of full-on youthful oak, or hold it a decade until it develops a soft, rich patina of age.",Australia-South Australia:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is soft, full-bodied and richly tannic, with blackberry jam, beef jerky and spice flavors. A little sweet and direct, but a nice wine to drink with steak, chops, grilled chicken, even Mexican food.",US-California:Syrah
"Candied, tutti-frutti aromas give this a sweet, somewhat faux bouquet with little concentration. But the palate is chewy and grabby enough, with solid but modest raspberry and red plum flavors. Mellow on the finish, with a decent feel. Good but not distinguished. Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Slightly sweet flavors of concentrated strawberry preserves create a rather thick mouthfeel. It's a jammy style of Pinot, to be sure, but with just enough supporting acidity to keep it from crumbling under its own weight. Drink over the next two or three years.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir

Give this time to unwind and fully develop.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"A contrast to the producer's fresh and fruity unoaked Cab Franc, Shaw's late-release reserve bottling showcases the massive concentration and depth found within the same grape variety in NY.

It's a powerful richly textured wine that should continue to develop well through 2025.",US-New York:Cabernet Franc
"Fragrant and fresh, this is a luminous and creamy sparkler with frothy foam and persistent perlage. The wine is flatter and broader in the mouth than most and has a smooth but thick texture.",Italy-Veneto:Prosecco

"Already five years old, this wine still doesn't hasn't opened up, seeming fairly muted aromatically. The flavors are medium bodied, round in the middle and tapering toward the finish.",US-Washington:Merlot
"A bit too soft and sweet for Zinfandel, but it sure is delicious in berry fruit, chocolate, pepper and herb flavors. Drink now with barbecue.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Plush, forward black cherry and plum flavors get a firm bristle of tannins in this rich but structured red. Hints of coffee grounds and rubber lend an earthy complexity to the mid palate. The finish is brisk but clean.",US-New York:Cabernet Franc
"This Malbec blend is bright, jammy and grapy on the nose. The palate is juicy but bumpy and rough in feel, while fresh-fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry are a little too candied and simple for a wine of this level. A ripe medicinal finish is lush but awkward.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Red Blend
"This wine has a vivid pink color, with strong aromas and flavors like canteloupe and peach. The rich, smooth texture keeps the fruit lingering through the finish.",US-California:Rosé
"The nose is bland, becoming vegetal and dull on the palate, with green bean and bell pepper flavors that are more normal for underripe Sauvignon Blanc than Chardonnay. This finishes pithy and green.",Chile-Maule Valley:Chardonnay

"Red berry, rose, leather and baking spice aromas come together in the glass.

Drink 2018–2028.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo

"Made in the Novy style, which seems to get a little softer and sweeter every year. Nonetheless, shows an interesting interpretation of this difficult Italian variety. It's a light-colored, light-bodied wine, with high acids and cherry jam and mocha flavors.",US-California:Nebbiolo
"Sweet oak on the nose results in creamy, chocolaty aromas, along with herbal notes, plum and berry. Feels tight but expansive, with solid tannins, bright acids and solid flavors of herbs, berry fruit, cassis, toast and chocolate. Keeps it together on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Too soft for comfort, and too sweet, although the softness may exaggerate the true sugar content. Either way, this simple wine has cloying, candied blackberry and mocha flavors.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Shows unexpected age, with brown around the edges and mature prune and orange-peel aromas. The flavors are more alive, but are not vibrant. Rather dull on the finish, this isn't bad wine but tastes like something four or five years older.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Perfumed and aromatic, this fruity red shows a good sense of structure. Flavors include Mediterranean herbs redolent of lavender as well as red plum, along with a dry core. The wine is ready to drink.",France-Provence:Red Blend
"This is a field blend from the steep Quinta da Foz vineyard at the mouth of the Pinhão River. Aged from two years in new wood, this impressive, structured wine is just setting out on its aging process. Big tannins and big fruit are all there, packed into dense tannins and a mineral texture. It will age well, don't drink before 2019.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red

"From Passadouro's old vines, this is serious, complex wine. Its fruit is an integral part of the dark tannic structure, adding to the gentle power. It has spice as well as juicy fruit, wood and, on the finish, sweet fruit flavors.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"Subdued, riper fruit has not yet come to the surface. Notions of Bramley apple are evoked on the nose; on the palate they show as the more rounded flavor of baked Bramley. Hovering above it all is grated lemon zest, pulling fruit, texture and freshness tautly together in a dry, fresh yet mellow finish. The more you taste, the more the still-underlying fruit yearns to rise to the surface. Best to give this some time so it can show its true, exciting colours.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"The first release annually from the estate vineyard, this is a solid effort, seemingly infused with scents and flavors of pine needle, pine tar, earth and bark. The fruit is in the background, and leans toward cranberry and brambly blackberry.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Remarkably strong cinnamon characterizes the nose of this old-vine wine, which also shows red and black cherries, potpourri and gingerbread on the nose. Black raspberries, cranberry-pomegranate juice, dark chocolate, purple flowers, black pepper and cardamom entertain the palate, which also offers decent acidity and grip, but finishes quickly.",US-California:Zinfandel

"Beautiful, aromatic wine, with raspberry fruit floating above the spice and toast. This is shot through with acidity and some dense tannins, but above all it is the piercing fruit that dominates. One of Jadot's signature wines, it is wonderful, with considerable aging potential.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"While demi-sec is the description, this almost as dry as some Brut Champagnes. Its flavors are of walnuts and pear juice along with a fine drive of acidity. This is food Champagne, looking for richer white fish or scallops as a pairing.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"This is a glamorous, fashionable wine that gives the pleasure you want in a bubbly. It's dryish and crisp, with doughy yeast, raspberry and lime flavors. A good price for a California sparkling wine of this quality.",US-California:Sparkling Blend

"Don't dismiss this aged Toro because it smells cheesy and leathery, and don't give up on it when you're hit with massive tannins. Because once this airs out and settles, you'll have a brawny wine with earthy, loamy flavors of baked blackberry and cassis. Nine years after harvest this is still tannic, grabby and earthy as they come. Drink now through 2019.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tinta de Toro
"Lively, fruity and well made, this wine has plenty of raspberry and cherry flavors, good acidity and light tannins to add a bit of grip to the texture. For a medium-bodied wine, it has nice concentration.",US-California:Barbera
"Mustard-seed aromas pierce the nose, which otherwise is mostly apple and pineapple. Lemon, green apple and passion fruit flavors are accented by the lightest touch of oregano and basil. For a cru, it's rather simple, with extremely light fruit on the finish and very little length or substance to the back end.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc

"Here's a country-style, rustic blend of Sangiovese, Canaiolo and Cabernet from the Maremma, and it fits the bill perfectly as an everyday red with some character. It's dry, full of cherry and plum fruit, and it finishes warm. Nothing too complex, but plenty to sink your teeth into.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Despite its modest alcohol level, this bottling speaks of ripe fruit. Lime and bergamot aromas bring a floral element, while the flavors are of tangerine and nectarine. A touch of residual sugar adds roundness to the mouthfeel.",Australia-South Australia:Riesling
"This bottling from a vineyard owned by the Fess Parker family is extremely gamy out of the gates, with raw lamb aromas lifted up by peppercorns and laid atop elderberry fruit. The lighter-bodied palate is framed by zesty acidity and a zippy pepper spice, with flavors of black currant and wild chaparral herbs.",US-California:Syrah
"Made with Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this opens with aromas of blackberry jam, iris and a whiff of new leather. The zesty palate shows black cherry and a hint of clove alongside brisk acidity and drying tannins that leave a sharp finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend

It's a simple, yet highly satisfying glass of red wine to drink over the next few years.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"An opaque purple color and charred, smoky aromas render this ripe-vintage Toro dark from the outset.

It's all about oak and slamming tannins now, so cellar and drink from 2020–2030.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"This wine is firm and closed up, with signs of heavy-handed extraction that give it a seriously dry character. It is hard to see these going away.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red

"The wood, with its heavy toast and licorice flavors, is dominant. That element makes for a wine that has weight but loses its fruit amid the firm extraction.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Coming from Waterbrook Estate, Blackrock and Summit View vineyards, this offers high-toned aromas, with notes of flower, soil and bittersweet chocolate. The palate is full of bold flavors backed by lively acidity and firm, slightly dry tannins.

The aromas don't all come together but this wine is worth exploring for the remarkable finish, which is about as good as it gets.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aged for a year in stainless-steel barrels, this wine is a combination of two vineyard blocks.

"The “X” designation refers to the number of clones in this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. You have to search for the richness—buried so deeply now—but it's there, like a pirate treasure of blackberries, black currants and cassis liqueur. Hard, thick and resistant now, it's framed by astringent tannins and a dryness that's almost arid. Charles Krug clearly built this wine to age, and there's no reason it shouldn't. Your window begins in 2018 and should last a very long time.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

Smooth and forward, it gathers itself and focuses through an engaging finish.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Sweet tangerine, tropical fruit and honey flavors mark this Chardonnay.

"Light in body, with a fine backbone of taut acidity, this is a throwback to a time when spätleses were slightly drier than today.

This would make a fine apéritif on its own, or could perhaps partner subtle seafood dishes.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling

"Upon opening, this smells oaky and lemony, although airing brings it around. Fresh and mildly astringent on the palate, this tastes oaky and briny at first, then more complex, deep and toasty as it spreads out.

"Mature black-skinned fruit, new leather, Mediterranean herb and dark spice are some of the aromas you'll find on this big, bold red.

"Savory aromas of beef jerky blend with raisin, grainy oak and sauciness on the nose of this Syrah-led blend. An exceedingly ripe palate feels inky with low energy.

"Extremely lifting and fluffy aromas of grape soda, very ripe olallieberries and nearly a bubblegum element arise on the nose of this accessible wine, which will appeal to lovers of many varietals. It's similarly poppy and easy to sip on the palate, with a strong acidic zing.",US-California:Syrah
"Bright and fresh, this is a totally fruity wine with a more serious edge at the end. Red cherries push through the crisp acidity that offers a zingy texture. The touch of minerality in the 40-year-old vines from the Chapoly vineyard granite soil gives an austere, structured aftertaste.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"A blend of Merlot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is indeed a sturdy red table wine. The tannins are dense and chewy, the fruit submerged beneath barrel flavors of toast, caramel and nougat. It spent 20 months in 50% new French oak.",US-Washington:Red Blend

"Brambly on the nose, with equally challenging and drying flavors of cranberry and rhubarb. There's very little to say about this stripped-down Cabernet other than that it's generally clean and not brutally offensive.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This barrel-fermented Viura smells so woody and grainy that it suggests turpentine and/or lacquer. The palate is light in body, but with resiny stickiness. Flavors of white table grapes, orange and raw oak finish severely woody.",Spain-Northern Spain:Viura
"This esteemed winery's annual bubbly is crafted much like its still Chardonnays, showing focused aromas of chalk, lemon zest and a telltale brie cheese rind dairy element. It's very yeasty and slightly sour on the mouthwateringly sharp palate, with squeezed limes, lemon pith and underripe kumquat flavors.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Cigar box and mulberry spice aromas lead the nose of this Cab, with fruity notes of black berry and cassis providing the backdrop. Full and lush in the mouth, the ripe black fruit carries through to the finish alongside accents of roasted coffee grounds. 550 cases imported.",South Africa-Stellenbosch:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Pinot's parts haven't found each other yet. There's big, ripe raspberry and cherry fruit, sweet, toasty oak, brisk acids and firm tannins, yet they form an unruly confederation. Stash this in the cellar until at least 2020.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A delicious Merlot, drily tannic and rich in blackberries, cherries and chocolate. Nearly as good as the winery's much more expensive Reserve. Great with grilled steak with sautéed mushrooms.",US-California:Merlot
"This wine is fresh, bright and light, with citrus and ripe yellow fruits. Crisp, light and aromatic, it's ready to drink.",France-Beaujolais:Chardonnay
"A big, juicy wine. Opens with young, almost jammy aromas of black cherry and black raspberry highlighted with earthier notes of tobacco. Turns long and persistent on the palate, as the fruity flavors are joined by those of grilled meat and tomato. Firm tannins hold it all together. This young, dense wine seems likely to improve for at least five years.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A consistent performer, Yalumba's Hand Picked Shiraz-Viognier seems slightly bigger and chunkier in 2008 than in the past, with bold fruit—blueberries and blackberries—accented by hints of mint. Expect some savory notes to develop over the next couple of years in bottle.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz-Viognier
"This single-vineyard wine from Dogliani, the spiritual home of Dolcetto, is made with wild yeasts. It's fragrant and structured, concluding with restrained wild-cherry, spice and mineral notes that come together with flair and finesse.",Italy-Piedmont:Dolcetto
"Masaréj is Castello del Poggio's top expression of Barbera d'Asti, but this vintage shows warm characteristics of earth, smoked bacon, bresaola, prunes and plums. It doesn't seem to have what it takes for long aging, so drink up.",Italy-Piedmont:Barbera
"Boedecker's Athena bottling is a very pretty wine, with a lovely entry offering pure, inviting cherry and berry fruit. Once in the mouth, it gently fades, just slightly disappointing as it seems to lose strength rather than gaining it. But the first impression is charming and delicious.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"High-toned tangerine and lime acidity cuts a sharp edge through this intensely ripe yet composed dry wine. It's zesty and green, but boasts rich yellow plum, melon and grapefruit flavors. It's delicious already but should continue to meld beautifully through 2025.",Germany-Pfalz:Riesling
"Aromas of coconut, vanilla and cassis lead into the dense palate along with black cherry jam, mocha and toast. Chewy drying tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2019.",Italy-Central Italy:Sangiovese
"Burnt caramel, vanilla and herbaceous dill notes lend an oaky feel to the dainty red-plum and violet flavors. The tannins are finely grained but persistent, extending the long, sour-cherry-flavored finish.",Germany-Baden:Spätburgunder
"Heady aromas of passion fruit and herb leap from the glass. The round palate doles out yellow peach, nectarine, mint and a note of candied ginger alongside fresh acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon
"Red berry, aromatic herb, pressed violet and dark spice aromas meld together in the glass. Firmly structured, the palate boasts intensity and energy, offering dark cherry, licorice and mint set against a backbone of fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity. It's well balanced but young so give this time to fully develop. Drink 2020–2032.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Extremely light on the nose, there are faint whiffs of yellow pear and lemon on this bottling from the Los Angeles coast. Yellow-apple skins, dried apple flesh and lime peels show on the sip, which is cut by a decent acidity and proves a straightforward take on the grape.",US-California:Viognier
"Soft and rounded, this is a wine that shows its ripe fruits upfront. It has a lightly textured character along with some spice for added interest. The aftertaste is fresh and crisp.",France-Bordeaux:Sauvignon Blanc
"The wine is dense with great fruit and accompanying structure. With its dark ripe berry fruits and full tannins, the wine is powerful although with great elegance. It is stylish, full of complexity ready to age well. Drink from 2024.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Earthy and rustic, this intensely tannic wine has a dry character. The fruit is all there, hiding behind this rough exterior. Allow the wine time to soften out and drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"This is a hearty, meaty wine that opens with aromas of smoked bacon, mesquite and A1 Steak Sauce. It feels smooth, rich and ends with a touch of bitter cherry.",Italy-Southern Italy:Aglianico
"Shows the rich flamboyance you expect in a Viognier, with enormously ripe tropical fruit, apricot, wildflower, vanilla and spice flavors. Easy to drink as a cocktail wine with hors d'oeuvres, like tempura dipped into soy sauce.",US-California:Viognier
"This robust wine features aromas of stewed plum, damp hay and anisette. These carry over to the warm palate, along with dried fruit flavors and the heat of evident alcohol that throws it off balance.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Fully ripe black-fruit aromas are rubbery and edgy. This feels jammy, heavy and simple. Flavors of syrupy blackberry and crème de cassis finish sweet and grapy with a sense of syrupy weight.",Spain-Northern Spain:Garnacha
"Thanks to the unique indigenous varieties used and the special double-fermentation process this wine undergoes, this delivers distinctive intensity and concentration, with spicy touches of cassis and toasted almond.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This frothy, straightforward wine offers citrus zest, yellow apple and canned pears packed in syrup. Zesty acidity gives it a bright finish.",Italy-Veneto:Glera
"Sweet in orange and papaya fruit flavors, yet lacking the vital acidity needed for balance. The result is cloying.",US-California:Sémillon
"There's a toughness to this wine that makes it a little hard to appreciate. The tannins are raw, and there's a green, herbal quality to the cherry and raspberry fruit. The oak seems to stand aside, and so does the acidity. It's all a bit ungainly now and is unlikely to improve with age, so drink up.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Dusty, yeasty apple and vanilla aromas are a touch briny and pickled. This feels mellow, with light vibrancy and effervescence. Direct white grape and apple flavors end soft.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"Dominated by the local Mourvèdre grapes, this is a ripe and complex wine. Its acidity is integrated with rich yellow fruits, spice and perfume. The wine is floral, poised and very stylish. Drink from late 2017.",France-Provence:Rosé
"From half an acre of vines within the Blanchot Grand Cru, this is a smooth, rounded wine. It has weight from intensely ripe fruits, along with structure. Beautifully sun-exposed vineyards add a warmth to the wine, but there's also a mineral texture, nervy acidity and tart apple-skin and green-plum flavors. While concentrated, it's still a young wine, so drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Very soft, this has a melted quality to the blackberry, cherry liqueur and cedar flavors. Everything about it is so fine, though it could have a firmer structure. Still, it's an elaborate wine that will pair well with beef or lamb. Drink now.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A blend of Grenache (50%) and Cinsault (20%) along with equal parts Mourvèdre and Syrah, this wine draws you into the glass with notes of smoked meat, bark, raspberry, blue fruit and peppery spices. It brings a rich, mouthful of generous fruit flavors that hit the delicious gong and then linger to hear it resonate.",US-Washington:Rhône-style Red Blend
"If the modern California style of exceptionally ripe fruit and sweet, smoky oak appeals to you, you'll love this wine. It's an explosion of pineapple jam, tangerine and vanilla cream flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Not very subtle, but flamboyant. Calling all shellfish to the dance floor.",US-California:Chardonnay
"With its tannins, this is initially a firm wine, but then ripe berry fruits emerge, followed by great acidity and freshness.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Made from two vineyards, Windsor Oaks and Rockin'B, this wine offers delightfully floral aromas of rose petal and grenadine syrup before expressing a fuller-bodied structure of tannin and oak. Still, it finishes lean in black cherry and plum.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Plump black cherry and plum flavors resonate through the core of this juicy, ripe Cabernet Franc. Its fruity forward style is approachable and appealing but there's a good dose of elegance as well. Brisk cranberry notes brighten the midpalate, leading a delicately tannic finish.",US-New York:Cabernet Franc
"Bracing and tangy, this light-bodied wine has distinct melon aromas, similar flavors and tasty accents of white pepper and fresh fennel. While nicely reserved it also has complexity and great balance.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"This single-vineyard blend includes Jaen's fruitiness and Touriga Nacional's strength. That makes for a smooth, juicy wine, richly endowed with the spice of wood aging but more generously with the red fruits of the Jaen grape. Dusty tannins show behind all this delicious fruit. Drink this concentrated wine now.",Portugal-Dão:Portuguese Red
"With a few years in bottle, this is maturing well. It has ripeness, the tannins beginning to soften into rich spice and damson jelly flavors. The acidity is still very present as is the dry core.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Light, crisp and fruity, this is a bright, citrus driven wine. It is dry, full of ripe apricot and grapefruit flavors. The wine is ready to drink.",Portugal-Vinho Verde:Loureiro
"A soft, melted mouthfeel and sweet flavors of raspberries and brown sugar mark this Zin. High alcohol gives it some heat, as well as a glycerine feel. The finish is dry.",US-California:Zinfandel
Vanilla and cookie dough flavors dominate. The fruit is light and simple cherry candy; the tannins are equally light. Quaffable and refreshing.,US-Washington:Merlot
"Sweet vanilla oak gives this full-bodied, tropical wine its signature, a luscious taste of fruit-forward approachability that risks becoming overdone. From Vine Hill Ridge Vineyard in the heart of the appellation, it exhibits the power and warmth of the vintage.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This wine is made from 50% Sémillon, 29% Sauvignon Blanc and 21% Sauvignon Blanc Musqué clone, the fruit sourced from both the Monte Rosso and Leveroni vineyards. It's fleshy and full of fig flavor, laced in mild lemon, quince and oaky vanilla.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon
"Champagne is the model for this ultraclassy wine. The aromas explode with toast, lees and the most delicately fragrant citrus and raspberry notes. It turns rich and subtle in the mouth. There’s a suggestion of fruit, but it’s really quite dry. The quality difference is in the harmony, elegance and balance. This is seriously good sparkling wine.",US-California:Champagne Blend
"Intense aromas of pressed broom, dried herb, hay and a whiff of tomato vine come together in the glass. The palate is fresh but rather closed, eventually revealing yellow apple skin, mineral and a saline note.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Friulano
"The nose has a yeasty, meaty character, while the palate is toasty. Rich flavors include ripe plum and vanilla followed by fragrant acidity at the end.",France-France Other:Chardonnay
"Saline, mineral, match stick and tropical fruit aromas define the bouquet. It feels plump but flat, with maderized flavors of white fruits that feature bitterness and not much kick. It's fleshy, remaining slightly bitter on the finish.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño
"The use of 100% Syrah gives a deep pink color that borders on purple. Aromas are rather strong too, with the flaky, buttered crust of a hot cherry pie running into the more bitter elements of citrus rinds. Those characters play leading roles on the palate as well, cherry candy toying with just-ripe grapefruit, providing tensions that keeps the sipping interesting. Just 72 cases produced.",US-California:Rosé
"A truly herbaceous, juicy wine from the cool climate of Touraine. It has bright, crisp, pure lemon flavors, light and fruity. A light minerality gives texture. A wine to drink now.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"This fragrant, light-bodied and savory Sicilian red opens with intense aromas of blue flower, rose and red berries. The bright, silky palate delivers juicy strawberry, crushed red cherry and white pepper alongside fresh acidity. Chill this for 20 minutes and sip on the deck for a perfect summer red.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Frappato
"Rounded in baked and dried fruit aromas, this is a soft, gentle wine with tangy acidity and swathes of ripe apple and orange citrus. A backbone of subtle oak gives it structure and complexity, finishing lean and bright, with a darker, richer twist of vanilla and clove in the mix.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Citrus freshness and frothy fizz make for an easygoing, feather-light and uncomplicated sparkler, perfect for informal gatherings. The finish is dry, clean and refreshing.",Austria-Österreichischer Sekt:Sparkling Blend
"Dark cola, black fruit and marzipan aromas give this a sweet bouquet. The palate is solid, with medium-strength tannins supporting cherry, blackberry and mocha flavors. Oak is no stranger to this wine, so expect ample vanilla and chocolate throughout. A bit herbal, which is common for Chilean Cabernet.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Clean, fruity and solid smelling, with a fresh, lightweight palate housing flavors of ginger, lime, lemongrass and powdered sugar. Easy on the finish. Textbook quaffing Cava if you like it a little sweet.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"This wine comes alive on the expansive, fleshy palate of black pepper and olive tapenade flavors. It walks a fine line between tenacious structure and high-cheekboned fruit—a mélange of raspberry, cassis and blueberry compote. The aromas are enticing and reminiscent of violets. Though it can be enjoyed now, it will evolve well through 2034.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's a wildland, coastal mountain taste to this wine, which brims with bone-dry, exotic, woodsy tastes of wild forest cherries, fennel, balsam, cola, volcanic minerals, raw beef and Asian spices, not to mention the sweet veneer of sandalwood. It's utterly distinct from other Pinots in its almost feral complexity, a wine that changes with every sniff and sip. Should develop through 2014. This is a great price for a Pinot Noir of this integrity and interest. Only 152 cases were produced, but it's worth the search.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This one's heavily about the oak. Comes out with spiced-up, minty aromas. Next up is a full and biting palate with buttery lead flavors followed by bitter black fruit. Flashes by quick on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Merlot
"Heaps of blueberry, blackberry and mocha flavors make up the palate of this dry, soft Merlot. A few drops of Petite Sirah, Malbec and Petit Verdot add layers of flavor and texture.",US-California:Merlot
"Dark pink-red in color, this wine has a ripe, sugary nose and a high-octane entry. It grows up to be tangy in citrus peel and fresh grapefruit and cherry, finishing dry.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is an exotic, flashy wine, marked by layers of ripe, sweet tropical fruit. Honey, peaches and mangoes are plump and mouthfilling, but end with elegance and finesse, making for a finely balanced wine worthy of the two-star accolade.",Germany-Mosel-Saar-Ruwer:Riesling
"This rather closed wine has layers of sulfur that have suppressed the fruit. It's cool, neutral and dull.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Just what the doctor ordered in a likeable, affordable white wine. Packs plenty of ripe spearmint and lemon flavors with enough acidity to make it bright and clean. A tiny amount of sugar will satisfy your sweet tooth without compromising the wine's basic dryness. Best Buy.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of apple, crushed stone and thyme come together on this vibrant white. The medium-bodied palate offers green pear, juicy nectarine, dried herb and flinty mineral alongside lively acidity. A note of bitter almond fills in the finish.",Italy-Central Italy:White Blend
"Firm and polished, this barrel-fermented wine is just rounded off enough, without damping the bright, almost crunchy fruit. There's a light touch of toast and the structure for further bottle age to improve it. Drink 2017–2025.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"This is a medium-bodied, plummy-tasting wine with mild raspberry, smoke and black-pepper flavors. Lighter than some, it's easy to enjoy.",US-California:Red Blend
"Floral scents, lemon zest, orange and pineapple swirl together, leading into a fruit-powered palate which reaches across the citrus spectrum and into papaya. Flavors are penetrating and the finish tight, so give it extra time to breathe.",US-Oregon:Pinot Gris
"There are just a few hints of pepper on this crisp, pear-scented dry white. This is made for a party with its light-bodied, easy-drinking style.",Austria-Burgenland:Grüner Veltliner
"This is a well-balanced wine, full of red fruits and with an attractive, deep salmon-pink color. It is ripe, showing plenty of fruit while also having a crisp texture and plenty of final acidity. The aftertaste is bright and lively.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Simple and satisfying with lots of ripe pineapple jam, orange sorbet, caramel, buttered toast, honey and cinnamon spices, in a creamy texture.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Chalky, mineral tones infuse the clean apple, Asian pear, white peach and melon rind aromas on the nose of this wine. It's pure and focused, with ample acidity that cuts through the ripe fruit flavors on the palate. Hints of orange blossom and clove-spiked citrus unfold on the finish. Drink now–2017.",South Africa-Stellenbosch:Chardonnay
"This is a structured wine, firm with tannins and still showing some of the wood-aging. Red-berry fruits are cut with crisper blueberries and considerable acidity. This is going to be a firm wine that is lightened by the fruit, and a very good representative of the vintage. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This Riserva Chianti Rufina offers clean, crisp aromas of wild berry and white cherry with distant renderings of spice and earth in the background. Pair this wine with roast chicken or pork.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"A 100% varietal wine, this has a biscuit-like, baked-bread quality to it, with a sweetness of tannin that threatens to overwhelm. The full body lacks in complexity and acidity.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Heavy aromas of baked berry fruits and raisin suggest a bit of overripeness. On the palate, that take is confirmed by chunky weight offset by natural acidity. Flavors of oak barrel, raisin and tart plum cover a wide spectrum, while this blend of Garnacha, Tempranillo and Carignan finishes long, with black-fruit flavors. Drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain:Red Blend
"Here's a Gavi with a heady fragrance of wild flowers, apple and white cherry. The round palate delivers creamy, ripe pear, green apple and mineral with a hint of lemon and herbs. Pair it with pasta topped with sun-dried tomato pesto.",Italy-Piedmont:Cortese
"The nose is slightly subdued with a faint touch of lemon balm and orange. The palate unpacks this with notes of both citrus and earth. There is something textured about that earthy feel, while all the freshness of lemon and orange zest dazzles the senses. This has purity and precision which lend a sense of weightlessness despite the undoubted power of the wine. The finish is wonderfully dry, refreshing and absolutely lip-smacking. Drink 2017–2030.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"From a small family estate named for the fireflies that live around the vineyard, this is crisp, with enough fruitiness to balance the acidity. It's light, refreshing and ready for warm-weather enjoyment.",France-France Other:Rosé
"A lovely wine, soft and charming, but far from simple. Although it has complex layers of cherries, blackberries, cassis and cedar, it also shows a fine structure of ripe, smooth tannins and supporting acidity. Drink now–2015 while it's fresh and forward.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Full bodied and well balanced, this wine has a broad, mouthfilling texture and enough concentration to carry its rich fruit notes into the finish. Cedar and black currant aromas meet black cherry and blackberry flavors, while a layer of fine-grained tannins frames the whole picture.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fruity and oaky, with pineapple cream, tangerine sorbet and buttered toast flavors. Made in a ripe, opulent California style.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Strikes an interesting balance between richness and austerity. Will fascinate true connoisseurs for its mineral-laden suggestions of dried lemons and kaffir limes, and the way sweet oak elaborates them. Crisp acidity provides the final balance of mouthwatering tartness. A true Chablis-style Chardonnay, at a fair price.",US-California:Chardonnay
"A barrel-aged Alvarinho, but one that is so delicately toasty that the fruit is what this ripe generous wine is all about. It is rich with citrus and pear flavors, zesty and tangy while also having room for a round ripe aftertaste. This is an impressive wine, ready to drink now.",Portugal-Vinho Verde:Alvarinho
"A dark, black-fruited wine, with the fruit hanging off the hard tannins. The wine is dark and concentrated, the fruit expressing itself as fragrant black currants. This dry wine is very firm and destined for a serious, long-term future.",Portugal-Port:Port
"The best of a very solid group of 2010 reds from StoneCap, this Syrah draws some inspiration from the Australian wines. Spicy and ripe, with lush black fruits and a lick of citrus. Vanilla and tobacco notes highlight the finish.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Very fruity and fresh in aroma, this elegant wine has light, crisp apple and lemon flavors, fresh-baked bread accents and lively acidity. A layered texture seems to blend in accents of almond and vanilla, increasing complexity with each sip. It's one of California's blue-chip bubblies.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"This cuvée has more complexity than its companion releases, perhaps owing to the inclusion of 10% whole clusters and/or the use of native (wild) yeast. Citrus, orange flesh and peel, and tart raspberry fruits are finished with a tannic burst.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Aromas include ripe black fruit, spice, savory herb and a balsamic note. The tight palate offers black raspberry, crushed blackberry, menthol and sage alongside a firmly tannic backbone. A licorice note signals the finish. It's still young and a little astringent on the close. Drink after 2016.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Conference pear and lemony acidity produce a clean-cut mouthfeel and real refreshment factor. The wine is concentrated but also is lean and soaring, supported by stony minerality.",Austria-Wachau:Grüner Veltliner
Ignaccio is a balanced and fresh Rosso di Montalcino with pretty tones of cherry and dried currant followed by black spice and wet earth. The wine would pair splendidly with pasta and creamy artichoke sauce.,Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Made in a very big, heavy and ripe style, this Pinot Noir offers waves of grilled blackberry, cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with sweet, smoky influences from oak barrels. It's delicious, but lacks delicacy and subtlety. Drink now.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This sophisticated effort maxxes out the potent cherry fruit with plenty of barrel toast. Much like the winery's reserve, the cherries are matched to roasted walnut flavors, with a hint of chipotle.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This is a Merlot-dominated Bordeaux blend. Along with pleasant, strawberry fruit you'll find scents of candied roses and hints of fresh herb. The length and detail bespeak a wine with medium-term aging potential. Baking spices dominate the finish, with a burst of heat from the near-15% alcohol.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Gritty aromas of asphalt, green peppercorn, saucy berry and hard spices precede a tight palate with grating tannins. This is oak-heavy, with sweet-and-saucy red-berry flavors. An oaky, tomatoey finish is rubbery in feel.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Easily one of the best Napa Valley Merlots out there. The cool vintage and southerly valley origins have played a role in giving a firm, dry structure to the cherry, currant, olive, mushu plum sauce and herb flavors. A quality wine, distinctive and complex, and for the price, a relative value.",US-California:Merlot
"Another strong entry in the emergent Cab-meets-Syrah category, this 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Syrah blend offers aromas of black plum, boysenberry, dried purple flowers and strong anise. The flavors are compelling, with baked boysenberry, strawberry and plum notes leading into roasted fennel bulbs and balsamic vinegar.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"Aromas of toast, sawdust, raspberry jam and menthol lead the way. The firm palate offers cherry liqueur, espresso and a hint of licorice while close-grained tannins provide the framework.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Despite the age, the color of this wine is still impressively vibrant and the ripe fruit and dense structure both speak of a wine that is still developing even nine years later. Such is longevity of a great Malbec. Blackberry fruit flavors charge through this wine that's reached the point of balance with the tannins. Drink now, although the wine will still be developing in 2018.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"A mix of Cabernet and Merlot, with small amounts of four other grapes, this is a soft red, with red and black fruit flavors. It's smooth and accessible, offering plenty of cocoa and sweet baking spice notes.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Candied, dusty aromas turn sweet and soapy if given time. The sugary feel to the palate stops just short of cloying, while candied raspberry, watermelon and brown sugar flavors end with milk chocolate and sweet red-fruit notes.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Sparkling Blend
"This blend is near-equal parts Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon along with a healthy dollop of Petit Verdot (18%). It shows a mix of fruit and savory elements, with notes of potting soil, green coffee bean, mocha, fresh herbs, licorice, generous barrel spices and red and black fruit—showing more with each swirl. The fruit and chocolate flavors are dense and rich, with bright acids and a firm core of tannins. The balance is spot-on and the finish lingers. It drinks beautifully now but you can expect it to age for another 20 years.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
This opens with a savory earth tone and drying layers of crushed stone and wet granite. There are also pretty aromas of violets and pressed blue flowers. It finishes with fine tannins and a slightly gritty texture.,Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"This attractive, fruity wine comes from vineyards in the Douro Superior region close to Spain. It is a fresh wine with red berry fruit flavors and bright acidity. It is still young although the fruitiness is enough to give a bright wine that is ready to drink now.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"From the firm whose iconic founder was the first to vinify and bottle 100% Grillo, this structured wine is fermented with native yeasts and aged in French oak barrels of varying size. It delivers intense sensations of lemon drop, apricot, honey and mineral and will develop more complexity over the next few years; drink now–2018.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Grillo
"The fruity characteristics are the star of this wine, with heady notes of forest berry, red plum and cherry that flood the nose and mouth. Accents of chocolate, menthol and sweet smoke add depth, but play a delicate supporting role to the fleshy fruit core. Medium weight, with fine tannins and a fairly easygoing structure.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Savory notes of pressed apple and golden toast accent this bristling, bright sparkling Chardonnay. On the palate, thick, dense mouth-filling foam carries flavors of zesty lemon and pear speckled with savory herbs.",US-New York:Chardonnay
"Curiously dusty wine, tasting of under-ripe cranberry with a coating of sweetness. While it is identifiably Sauvignon Blanc, it does seem to have missed out on the region's signature minerality. Screwcap.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"There is a fine combination of lightness and richness in this wine. The lightness comes from its fresh, crisp green flavors. The richness comes from the concentration, the flavor going deep down into the taut palate, acidity, mouth-filling green plums and spice. Screwcap.",Austria-Wachau:Grüner Veltliner
"Linear and mineral driven, this intriguing white opens with aromas of beeswax, acacia, citrus, stone fruit and a yeasty whiff of bread crust. On the expressive palate, a mineral note underscores juicy yellow peach, nectarine and apple. There's a lot going on and a lot to enjoy here.",Italy-Veneto:Garganega
"Big, and powerful, this has generous flavors of yellow fruit, pear and integrated spice. It has weight to go with its more fruity character. With wood influence, refreshing acidity and a suggestion of tannin, it will age over the next 2–3 years.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Add Aurora to your list of dry Sherries that won't steer you wrong. It is a concentrated, slightly more powerful style of manzanilla with pear, pepper and rosemary aromas as well as a true, refined palate. Flavors of fresh mushroom and nuts are dry and just fruity enough. Like a kiss from the sea.",Spain-Andalucia:Sherry
"Ripe and soft on the nose, this blend of Monastrell, Garnacha and Syrah is so easygoing that it lacks pop up front. Plump and fruity on the palate, this is low on structure and acidity. Jammy raspberry and strawberry flavors end in friendly fashion, but with low definition. Drink now.",Spain-Levante:Red Blend
"Good price for a wine this rich and pleasing. With masses of blackberries, cherries, currants, anise and cedar folded into firm tannins, it's ready to drink now. Just might be the best value you'll find in a Spring Mountain wine, red or white.",US-California:Meritage
"Coconut and vanilla are the lead aromas, while there's leather and ripe berry and cassis below the surface. Feels tight, juicy and prickly, with zesty acidity and typical Chilean Cabernet flavors of leafy berry, earth, tobacco and oaky vanilla. Feels snappy and tight as it finishes with oaky, leafy flavors.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley:Red Blend
"Alluring aromas of violet, rose, dark berry and a hint of cured meat emerge on this firmly structured wine. The palate is rather extracted, offering rich black cherry, chocolate, tobacco and sweet spice alongside grippy tannins.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Tough tannins set the scene for this firm and extracted wine, giving it a smokiness and a touch of bitter fruit. However, the wine has the weight to support the tannins, and it hints at future juicy fruit. Keep this for at least five years.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"From Vine Hill Vineyard, this wine is juicy in raspberry and vanilla, made in a fuller-bodied style with pronounced tannins on the finish. Let it open to express itself fully.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"One of the top Margaux wines, this is in top form, finely balanced and as elegant as it is powerful. It is darkly structured, dense yet balancing tannins with ripe black plums. It expresses the complexity of the vintage. A wine for serious, long-term aging.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The ethereal, aromatic lift of this wine is addictive. It appears like the sublimation of fresh, ripe apple. The dry, brisk palate adds streaks of lanolin and earthiness to that profound, glistening freshness and the distinctly phenolic texture. Drink and think. The wine will shine until at least 2025.",France-Alsace:Alsace white blend
"The reserve Chardonnay from Eola Hills gets an extra year in bottle, and it has a more elegant, vertical structure, with the fruit framed in toasty oak flavors and some tarragon spice. It's persistent as well; the flavors seem to gather strength in the midpalate and continue through a strong and moderately complex finish.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"This wine is a fine exposition of the structure and density of a serious Douro wine. A field blend, it is packed with dark berry fruits and sweet tannins, with a strong mineral element that reflects the tough schist of the vineyards. It's drinkable now, but the wine will be better in 2016.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"The winery is in eastern Oregon, near the Idaho border, but the grapes were sourced from an unnamed Willamette Valley vineyard. A bit high-toned, with sharply defined strawberry and cherry fruit, this finishes with a burst of caramel and mocha.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
Whiffs of bramble and earth lend a savory tone to fresh red berry and apple flavors in this dry-style rosé. It's brisk with acidity and refreshingly quaffable.,US-New York:Rosé
"This is one of the vintage's knockout rosés, thanks in part to the Grenache and Gamay grapes that make up the blend. It's pale pink in color, with supple lime pith, strawberry, chalk and melon aromas. The palate is tense with structure, its bubblegum and lemon peel flavors riding a wave of acidity that persists long into the finish.",US-California:Rosé
"A very nice Pinot. You might call it well-behaved. It's clean, dry and crisp, showing good coastal character in the acid-brightened cherry and pomegranate flavors that are enriched with a little smoky oak.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Despite the low alcohol reading, this comes across as dry rather than off dry. Apple, pear and white peach anchor a just-ripe-enough wine with highlights of citrus oil. There's good length and focus throughout.",US-Oregon:Riesling
"Initially dry and tannic, the wine shows dark fruits with blueberry flavors, smoke and spice. It is rich and dense, already with the fruit right up front. Drink now or better age.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Baked pear and sweet, baked apple make for an inviting opening. The same friendly duet plays on the off-dry palate all the way to the lingering finish. Along the way, there are highlights of zesty lemon and richer hints of honey and melon. It's simple, fun and even a little bit intriguing.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"Upfront earthy aromas of black olive render this Malbec's berry notes as secondary. This feels chunky, even a bit flabby. Flavors of black fruits and peppery spice finish with a note of oaky mint and drying tannins. Drink now through 2018.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"A tight line of margarita salt, lemon and sourdough toast show on the layered nose of this countywide blend that is one of the stronger performers in the Alma Rosa catalogue for the price. There is a steely texture to the sip, with flavors of wet wool, Marcona almond and tangerine blossom.",US-California:Chardonnay

"This powerful ripe wine has firm tannins that are so well integrated. With acidity and with rich black fruit, the wine is concentrated and dense. From a small parcel on the slope of Saint-Emilion, it is a wine to age for many years. Drink from 2026.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Named for the proprietor/winemaker's favorite two roses, the flowers not the wine, this is indeed a wholly floral experience, subtle and delicately crafted to exude wild strawberry, orange and lime. Dry and refreshingly crisp in acidity, it's a light take on beautiful complexity.",US-California:Rosé

"The 2006 Zachary's Ladder is 65% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot. Beautifully defined, sharp and tight. Still compact, dense, hard and young, but loaded with mixed flavors of black cherry, iron and rock. The tannins are tough and hard, the wine is firm and focused.",US-Washington:Red Blend

It's the perfect accompaniment to Asian-fusion fare.",US-California:Viognier
"Giacosa Fratelli (to be distinguished from the venerable house of Bruno Giacosa) tends to make good, solid wines but never anything really earth shattering. This proved to be one of his best, a lovely nose of dark fruit, chocolate, soy and smoked meat. Quite soft on the palate, but rich and layered,and although it showed a touch of mid palate hollowness, the finish was good if somewhat chunky. Needs 3-5 years to really come round.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Upon opening, this wine showed some funky low tones that blew off after a while to reveal an unusual mix of aromas, including cotton candy, stewed prunes and fresh nuts. The light-to-medium-bodied palate is more classic, with razor-like acidity and raspberry and cherry flavors. Delicious cherry-berry finish. Try with beef stew.

"Scents of ripe plum, espresso, cake spice, menthol and a whiff of toasted oak lead the nose.

"This opens with a pleasing toasty aroma, following through on the palate. That deft touch of French oak (33% new) frames a solid core of strawberry preserves and Bing cherry fruit. It resonates on through a stylish, textural finish. Enjoy this immediately, and tuck away a few bottles to drink in five years.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Gritty, granular, medicinal aromas smell reedy and like crushed vitamins. A choppy palate and flavors of plum, grape juice and raspberry end with cutting tannins and the essence of raspberry.",Spain-Northern Spain:Garnacha
"Good for simple everyday drinking, this wine is slightly sweet but crisp with delicate citrus, peach, vanilla and honey flavors.",US-California:Pinot Grigio
Light volatile aromas distract from this blend of Seven Hills (75%) and Les Collines vineyards. The fruit flavors seem a bit leaner than expected and also somewhat dried out.,US-Washington:Syrah

"The mocha, spice and dark raspberry aromas seem quite locked-up at present. The red and black fruit flavors meanwhile show subtlety and depth.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Planted in 1983, this is the original Willamette Valley Vineyards estate vineyard.

"Verdicchio is celebrated for its crisp, green aromas that resemble lime, kiwi and cut grass. This expression offers those notes, with an added touch of lemon candy.",Italy-Central Italy:Verdicchio
"Subdued aromas of red berry and rhubarb take shape in the glass. The reserved palate offers up crushed cherry, green tea and a hint of vanilla alongside fresh acidity and slightly astringent tannins.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Nero
"Almost difficult at first, this smells a lot like iodine, sweaty horse and stalky berry fruits. Although bumpy and hard, this is big and full in body. Roasted, herbal, peppery black-fruit flavors come back with an underripe stalky note on the finish.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Carmenère
"This fruity wine boasts flavors of mango, pineapple and apricot. It is full and ripe, with bright fruitiness and ample acidity. Some wood aging adds an attractive toasty accent to this warm wine.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese White

"A beautifully balanced wine, its acidity lacing through the smooth apricot and orange zest flavors and riper red fruits. It does show richness and weight, although always with great freshness.",France-Provence:Rosé
"Smells and tastes Porty, with caramelized raisin and black currant flavors. And with nearly 17% alcohol, it's hot.",US-California:Zinfandel
"A very fine Pinot Noir, dry and elegantly constructed, but it needs a little time in the cellar. That's due to the tannins, which are thick and noticeable in the way they create an astringency through the finish. The flavors are exceptionally rich, suggesting cherries, raspberries and tobacco, with a welcome sweetness from toasty oak.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Here's a complex, layered wine that impresses for sheer power. It floods the mouth with ripe flavors of black currants, blackberries, black cherries, dark chocolate, anise and cedar that finish deep and long. Delicious and dry, but quite closed now in tannins, and needs time. Best after 2009, at least.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Cherries and mushrooms play the lead roles in this silky-textured wine. Hints of cinnamon, brown sugar and mocha speak to oak aging, but this is driven by fruit, not barrels. Drink now–2019.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Pinot Noir

"Light and bright, this fruity wine has a more bitter element that gives a sharper character that will hopefully round out. At the back, plenty of acidity leaves a crisp aftertaste.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"A lovely Zinfandel, soft and dry, with luscious cherry, raspberry and sandalwood flavors, dusted with pepper and cocoa. Easy to drink and versatile with everything from pizza to a grilled steak.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Briny saltwater aromas dominate a mild mostly fruitless nose. This feels basic and round, with a lemony streak. Mild nectarine flavors don't amount to much, while this is simple and generic on the finish.",Chile-Central Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"This medium-bodied wine has a slightly dusty mouthfeel, which gives its palate just enough shape to highlight the flavors of dried dark-skinned fruit. It's a little pruney, but would probably work fine with stews or hard cheeses.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Spicy in character, this is rich, smooth and weighty. Because of its richness, it seems sweet. For a contrast, the acidity lends a light, crisp aftertaste.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer

"On the nose, this Carmenère is integrated and earthy, with cedar, black cherry, baked plum and spice aromas.

Drink through 2019.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Carmenère
"Along with the typical warmth of an Alentejo wine comes an earthy character that is less attractive. There are juicy rhubarb and redcurrant tones, but they are engulfed by its rustic character. Drink now.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"This savory white opens with aromas of acacia flower, crushed stone and citrus zest. The ripe round palate gives pear, chopped herb, baked pineapple and a flinty (almost smoky) note.",Italy-Veneto:Garganega
"A very pretty expression of Cabernet Franc with notes of cherry, chocolate and floral notes. It's elegant in style with a textured, satiny mouthfeel and a tart, lingering finish.",US-Washington:Cabernet Franc
"There's a lot of tropicality on the nose of this blend of 82% Roussanne, 10% Viognier and 8% Sauvignon Blanc, including mango, guava, coconut and banana chips. Those elements also show on the palate, but are honed in by a grippy texture and crisp acidity.",US-California:White Blend
"While blossom and melon aromas on this Gewürztraminer are subdued, the palate is a veritable explosion of jasmine, lychee and grapefruit flavors. Silky, rich and mouth-filling, it's balanced neatly by fresh citrus acidity and a bold, phenolic finish.",US-New York:Gewürztraminer
"Concentrated swells of peach and honey sweeten this bright, sunny off-dry kabinett. While crisp, almost lacy, in mouthfeel, stark, lemony acidity drives a piercing finish. Drink now.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling

"Earthy, warm and generously oaked, with berry aromas that bring leather and smoke. The palate is healthy and tight, with spiky tannins and herbal black fruit flavors. Grippy on the finish, with olive and spice. Very much a good-quality, typically styled Chilean Cabernet.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This barrique-aged Chianti Classico shows cherry and espresso aromas. It has very ripe cherry and raspberry flavors that are just shy of overripe, along with vanilla and coffee notes. You'll also find drying wood tannins that cut the palate short. David Bowler Wines, Lemma Wine Company.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"A tasty tang of toasted oak adds a great top note to this full-flavored and full-bodied wine, so that it seems to build complexity from the bass notes of ripe pear, to the butter and cinnamon in the middle and up to the wrapping of spicy, smoky oak.",US-California:Chardonnay

"A bit harsh in the mouth and soft, which emphasizes the extracted fruit and makes the wine taste syrupy in blackberries and licorice.",US-California:Red Blend
"Blended from several inland sites, this is a good value in spice-driven Shiraz. Cinnamon, clove and vanilla lead the way, backed by strawberry and raspberry fruit. The finish is long, tart and slightly dusty, marked by just a hint of maple syrup. Drink now–2018.",Australia-Victoria:Shiraz
"Notions of ripe fresh pears and pear compote on the nose segue into the more pliable fruitiness of ripe mirabelle plums. This is off-dry but offset by a little phenolic grip and a lively streak of freshness. Nose, palate and finish all speak of golden mirabelles.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer

"Simple and fruity, this has tangy a tangy raspberry flavor. It's light and zesty, with a fine, fresh aftertaste.",France-Provence:Rosé
"Lightly roasted, earthy and slightly nutty up front, this smells of buttery oak along with plum and cherry.

"Hanzell says this Sebella Chardonnay is meant to drink now, while their regular Chardonnay, which is famously ageable, develops in the cellar. That's strange logic, because the wine is so close to the regular Chardonnay as to be nearly indistinguishable. It's bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally, with citrus, green apple and pear flavors. Give it 3–5 years.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Here's a quirky but alluring Ripasso with offbeat aromas of black olive and eucalyptus folded between dark aromas of ripe fruit, tobacco and moist earth. It offers a long-lasting but medium-bodied mouthfeel that would match braised meat or stew.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"

"Rarely do you come across something like this: mature and complex Malbec from Cafayate. Earthy aromas of plum, prune, raisin and tobacco give this an Old World bouquet. Saturated but with enough acidity to maintain balance, this tastes rooty, chocolaty and earthy, with mocha, toast and toffee flavors on a heady finish. Drink now.",Argentina-Other:Malbec

"There is more fruit than structure in this wine, giving the palate a bright, red-berried character and soft tannins. It's juicy, but there's also some smokiness. A blend of Zweigelt, Blaufränkisch and St Laurent, it is ready to drink now. Screwcap.",Austria-Burgenland:Austrian Red Blend
"With its tight minerality and vivid green fruits, this is a fine representative of the freshness and richness of 2006. While Bouchard Père is generous with the wood, it does not dominate because the fruit flavor texture and finishing freshness are so important.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Touches of unripe vegetal aromas and flavors compromise this wine, despite some jammy blackberry and cherry flavors. Because of its thinness, its high alcohol content makes it feel hot. Drink now.",US-California:Zinfandel

"Lavish yet not overdone aromas of vanilla, plumeria, dried banana and yellow peach arise from the glass in this blend of 45% Viognier, 45% Marsanne and 10% Roussanne.

Prugnolo Gentile (another name for Sangiovese) is blended with small percentages of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon to produce a firmly intense wine with black fruit aromas and spicy cardamom. There's a gritty quality to the tannins and overall texture.,Italy-Tuscany:Prugnolo Gentile
"Theoretically a very light rosé, the “Eye of the Partridge” is really a Pinot Noir blanc in this vintage, and joins a growing cohort of such wines from Oregon.

On the finish, a delightful detail of carpaccio appears.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This ripe, creamy wine has apricot flavors laced with citrus acidity. Lightly textured, it is still developing and needs to age for the next few months. Drink from the end of 2016.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay

"This is a simple but delicious Pinot Noir. It has candied cherry flavors that are sweet and sour, with lots of toasty, vanilla-scented oak. Drink up.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Easygoing and fresh, with black fruit, herbs, spice and smoked meat on the nose. The palate is generally smooth and proper, while the cherry cola, mince meat and other savory flavors work well together. Nothing outrageous, but gets it more right than wrong. Definitely smells and tastes like Carmenère.",Chile-Rapel Valley:Carmenère

The palate is tart with plum skin, asphalt and black rocks, a very intriguing style though not for those seeking a hearty Syrah.",US-California:Syrah
"It's soft and simple, with earthy flavors of mushrooms, cola and raspberries that lead to a dry, fairly tannic finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This simple wine has juicy blueberry and baked cherry flavors at its core, a lushness on the palate that is supported by firm tannins and oak.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Harsh and hot, with sweet and sour flavors of oranges and mint.",US-California:Petite Sirah

"Offered in remembrance of winery co-founder, Emily Miner, this wine is softened by 5% Cabernet Franc, the grapes coming from a handful of vineyards, including Stagecoach and Emilio's Terrace. Dried herb, graphite and sagebrush highlight a tight structure that's grippy and savory, with understated oak. Drink now through 2023.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fresh smells of blue raspberry and black licorice characterize the nose. On the palate, it's heavily tannic, beginning with some cherry before becoming distractingly grippy. Hold until 2017.",US-California:Merlot
"Gritty berry aromas are solid but a bit underwhelming for a wine of this price. Heavy, sticky and tannic on the palate, this tastes of herbal berry fruits and a ton of oak. That woodiness reverberates on the finish via maple, resin and toast flavors, while hard tannins make this more about power than finesse. Drink through 2025.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon
"An evocatively perfumed wine, with aromas of pine, eucalyptus and spice. To taste, it is open, generous, its tannins cushioned inside ripe, jelly black fruits. Everything mingles well, the core of dryness an essential component of the richness of the wine.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"It's been a while since we've reviewed this wine, so this is a fine comeback. Plum, blackberry and rubber aromas are solid, but the real star is the palate, which is smooth and thick, with lush dark fruit flavors and a smoky background. Good, slightly herbal and long on the finish.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Carmenère

The components are balanced and the flavors pure and well integrated. The length and balance suggest that this should drink well at least through 2022.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This is as serious as Grüner gets. It's a very rich wine, fully structured, packed with ripe apricot flavors with a touch of lime. The texture is dense, mineral still very young. With concentration and young acidity, it needs to age. Drink from 2017.",Austria-Kamptal:Grüner Veltliner

"Simultaneously snappy and creamy on the nose. The palate is a touch tangy and raw, but there's enough clean Garnacha fruit coming in raspberry/cherry flavors that it warrants more than a single pass.

A super value, and just plain delicious.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Black fruit, clove, char and mocha are the primary aromas on this heavily oaked, saturated Monastrell.

Flavorful to the max but a bit too soft to be considered excellent.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Coming from Two Blondes Vineyard, aromas of baking spice, barrel spice, herb, mesquite and cherry are followed by elegant smooth-feeling fruit flavors. Light bacon notes provide unusual accents. It's intriguing, though the variety is hard to find.",US-Washington:Malbec
"Aromas offer an assortment of high-toned black licorice, woodspice and dark-cherry notes. The rich black-fruit flavors reflect the warm vintage while staying in balance.",US-Washington:Cabernet Franc
"A dense, baked, raisiny nose is ultra ripe but also a bit flabby and damp-smelling. A big, grabby mouth-filler, this offers baked, oaky flavors of blackberry, fig and chocolate, finishing with lingering chocolate and prune. Drink this chunky, superripe Priorat sooner rather than later.",Spain-Catalonia:Red Blend
"Produced from vines planted in 1900 (MCM in Roman numerals), this is a serious, major wine.

"All red cherry and banana fruit, this is a soft, juicy and bright wine. Attractive and fresh, just edged with a slightly dry texture.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay

The herbal side of Cabernet is noted without being intrusive. Classic, deep and expressive.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Vivid fruit flavors meet spicy new oak accents in this full-bodied, extroverted GSM. It smells like toasted bread, cloves and cinnamon, and tastes like ripe blackberries and smoked bacon while a very firm, grippy, nicely tannic texture completes the picture.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Principally Grenache (55%) and Mourvèdre (43%) topped off with a pinch of Viognier, this wine brings barrel-forward aromas of vanilla, toast and char along with red fruit. The cherry and plum flavors are lush, full and creamy but they struggle to get beyond the oak treatment.",US-Washington:Red Blend

"This classy Walla Walla Syrah is still young and tightly wound, with juicy acids and flavors of tart berry and wild mountain fruit.

"Crisp, mineral and tight, this is still a young bottling. It is dry, full of citrus-fruit flavors and with a fine burst of acidity that cuts through the wine. Let this delicious wine settle for a few more months to add more fruit to the texture. Drink from late 2018.",France-Champagne:Chardonnay

Albeit more informal, this luminous and fresh Pinot Grigio offers pristine aromas of stone fruit and citrus.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Grigio

"Stash this in the cellar for a while, because even though it's well over three years old, it's still a big, immature wine. Dry and tannic, it explodes with jammy blackberries, cherries, chocolate, cola, licorice, orange zest and pepper flavors, wrapped into sweet, smoky oak. The parts should begin to come together by the end of 2009.",US-California:Syrah

"One word describes this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend—huge. It's thick and dense in the mouth, with considerable tannins framing ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, currants, green olives, mocha and toasty oak.

Hints of cinnamon wind through the finish, and overall the impression is of a pretty, lively and slightly sweet wine without pretense.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Ripe, sweet-smelling and “muy moderno,” but by no means is this Syrah-led warrior only fruit, bulk and oak. Spanish wine writer Victor de la Serna's wine gets better all the time. This vintage is like berry cake in a glass, but it's not short on anything, including acidity and tannic structure. Expect a blast of fruit flavor, intensity in reserve, and some forward oak, vanilla and butter. Should settle into form over the next 18 months.",Spain-Central Spain:Red Blend
"A big, super-rich wine that concentrates on its vanilla and spice aspects, the fruit coming through as ripe quince and apricots flavored with pepper. The acidity is muted, appearing only at the end, to give a vibrant lift to this impressive wine. Glass stopper.",Austria-Kamptal:Grüner Veltliner

"This is a juicy and formidably tannic version of the variety, from a famed vineyard known also for Zinfandel. Dry oak and intrusively harsh texture need mellowing before the more gentle notions of dried herb and black cherry can shine.",US-California:Cabernet Franc
"One of a pair of wines from this producer paying homage to neighboring regions, this wine references the Malbec of Cahors. It is softer than some Malbecs, bringing out the grape's fruitiness and acidity rather than its structure. That makes it a candidate for drinking young, starting from early 2018.",France-Southwest France:Malbec

"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling from tech power couple T.J. and Valeta Rodgers offers rich aromas of dried Mission fig, elderberry and black cherry, along with clay, loam and purple flowers.

"Concentrated chocolate and licorice flavors characterize this wine, which shows signs of extraction along with a burn from the alcohol. Its fruit is the high point, with a burst of ripe blackberry juice, plus a black-currant-like tautness. The superripe Merlot will need several years to soften.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"The expected cut-grass element shows on the nose of this wine from the longtime organic estate, but it also features riper, warmer aromas of nectarine, fragrant lemon skins and a slate minerality. There's lots of energetic pop on the sip, which shows more grass alongside lime juice, pith and skin.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"This blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre, Carignan, Counoise, Grenache and Cinsault immediately appeals with its aromas of plum, candied raspberry and garrigue, with no oak influence anywhere in sight. It's fruit laden, focused and supple, with a feel that dazzles the senses and pure fruit flavors that just won't quit.",US-Washington:Rhône-style Red Blend

"Raspberries, cherries, cola, tea, rhubarb pie, licorice, vanilla and sweet leather flavors flood the mouth, wrapped in a delicately silky, complex texture, and the finish goes on and on in oak-inspired fruit and Asian spices. Compellingly delicious; drinks now and through 2009.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"The wine is structured with firm tannins as well as ripe fruit. Juicy and concentrated, it has a spicy character that comes from the wood aging. In the Mayé Eymery family since 1854, the wine is from six parcels on the estate. Give this fresh as well as rich wine until 2019.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This slowly reveals aromas of pressed rose, star anise, ripe berry and a menthol note. On the firm, straightforward palate, hints of licorice and clove add interest to dried black cherry.

It should age for up to 20 years.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Named The Teacher to honor the late Stan Clarke—a viticulturalist, winemaker and mentor to many in the Washington wine business—this is pure Cabernet. Astringent and tannic when first opened, it expands with air to reveal good varietal flavors of cassis and black cherry, with light herb and a streak of licorice. Slightly volatile and leathery, with good concentration.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dark like a cave in color, this big red blend consists of Zinfandel, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Merlot, all sourced from vineyards in Lodi and Clarksburg. Oaky and tannic, not overdone alcohol-wise, the cherry flavors are just right for the backyard barbecue or other casual meat-eating gathering.",US-California:Red Blend

"Very rich, very flamboyant, a Chardonnay that rocks your palate with flavor, yet has the acidic structure and dryness to keep it from going over the top. Pure Bien Nacido in the wealth of tropical fruit and spice flavors, so nicely balanced with a deft touch of oak. It represents a step above the '05 and is a wine to watch.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Earthy and a touch gritty smelling on first take, this gets riper, cleaner and better the longer it catches air. A full slightly tannic palate is mildly abrasive, while tea, herbal berry and chocolaty oak flavors are appealing. A spicy peppery chocolaty finish is not shedding its drying tannins. Drink through 2022.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"This sound, Port-style wine is made from Zinfandel. It shows briary flavors of wild red and black berries, milk chocolate and Christmas plum pudding, with spices of cinnamon, anise and nutmeg. Could use greater structure, as it's a bit soft.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Tilled soil, forest floor, mature black-skinned fruit, leather and a truffle note come together in the glass. The firmly structured palate presents juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, vanilla and an earthy hint of game while assertive, close-grained tannins provide support. Give it a few years for the tannins to relax then enjoy. Drink 2019–2023.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Slightly more advanced notes stand out: a herbal tinge of sun-warmed, wild thyme has crept into the citrus peel which utterly dominates the palate. This sleek Smaragd has just started on its long ascent. It has the toned muscle and the stamina to go on and on—those who have enjoyed older vintages know of its near eternal youthfulness. On the aftertaste, herbal notes assert themselves again: dried tisane of verbena and dried apple punctuate with pleasant accents.",Austria-Wachau:Riesling

"Situated at the highest point of the Entre-deux-Mers region, the estate is dominated by the ripe Merlot in this wine. It is fruity and soft with lively acidity and gentle tannins.

"With 7% residual sugar and 11% alcohol, this is a Riesling to enjoy with spicy noodle dishes. Sweetness notwithstanding, it's a substantial wine with grip and definition. Melon and peach flavors roll smoothly into notes of caramel and honey. This is rich and delicious.",US-Washington:Riesling
"Bright cherry and wild berry are lavished in thick layers, adding intensity and persistency. This modern Chianti Classico is 20% (the maximum allowed) Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.

"A generously ripe wine with 8% Petite Sirah, this has a softly layered entry that reveals strong aromas of black olive and plum, before delving headfirst into spicy blackberry cobbler. Complex and smooth, it offers heightened acidity and a richly chocolate finish.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Shows the fine varietal characteristics of dryness, silkiness and fruitiness you want in a nice Russian River Pinot, with suggestions of cherries, currants, root beer and smoky oak. There's also a streak of wintergreen tartness that seems to limit the cellar-worthiness. Best now and through 2010.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A blend of 61% Cabernet Franc and 39% Merlot, this has scents of black fruit and green bell pepper that are characteristic of many Bordeaux-style blends, with underpinnings of savory spice and char. The full-bodied palate has a soft, chocolaty core, boasting medium-grained tannins and easy acids that lend enough lift.",US-Virginia:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"90-92. Barrel sample. This wine is laden with tannins yet shows juicy, crisp red-berry flavors. It finishes with great structure.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"With its black pepper aromas and dry, hard tannins that make the mouth pucker, this is an atypical Rutherford Cabernet. But it's a very good, even a noble one. As tough as it is, it possesses a rich core of black currant that lasts through a long finish. Unusual and distinctive, it should hold its own for a decade.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"There is 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay in this sparkling Brut. Golden-apple in color, it offers flavors and aromas that follow suit, rich in ripe apple, hazelnut and chestnut with a layering of natural sweetness on the finish.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"A vineyard farmed by the family, Rockpile Ridge is set at the 1,200-foot elevation and planted to nine blocks of the variety, harvested and fermented separately. In this vintage, that leads to full-bodied, well-developed flavors of blackberry dotted in black-peppery meat and dusty tannin.",US-California:Zinfandel

"Baked apple with cinnamon and caramel make this immediately seductive. On the palate, faint notes of baked plum lurk teasingly in the background.

A disarming, astonishing and utterly delicious wine.",Austria-Burgenland:Zweigelt
"Flinty notes of reduction are top aromas, then citrus-fuelled pepperiness ensues. This is lively, lithe and brisk with lip-smacking freshness and a total refreshment factor. It has the tension of a high-wire. These are Riesling acrobatics in a glass. Bravo.",Austria-Wachau:Riesling
"Rich and juicy, this wine holds excellent potential. With its ripe red-berry fruit, balanced tannins and acidity, and spice from the wood aging, it will become a concentrated wine. Drink from 2020.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Michael David makes bombastically huge wines, but here they've mastered the style, making a black-as-night Syrah true to it's roots, with flavors of dark red fruit, bacon and toast, with a wall of vanilla and oak. It's juicy, jammy and surprisingly well integrated, a wine that's ready to drink now, preferably with a sizzling tri-tip.",US-California:Syrah

"Subdued aromas of citrus, acacia flower and a whiff of almond come together on this wine. The vibrant palate offers yellow apple, pear and lemon zest alongside bright acidity and a firm perlage.",Italy-Veneto:Glera
"Typical of the huge power of Guiraud, this is one of the richest Sauternes in 2005. The wine is rich and intense, the dry edge of botrytis just dominating the sweetness. Flavors of honey, almonds and peaches give the wine extra complexity.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Subtle hints of ripe, winter-stored apple on the nose lead to an equally apple-dominated palate that shows soft pepper spice. A wonderful midpalate texture and baked-apple richness are countered by lemon freshness. This is very appetizing and cries out for soft cheeses.",France-Alsace:White Blend
"While the concentrated flavors of peaches and sweet pears are pleasant, whiffs of smoke and toasted nuts lend a savory, rather atypical character to this dry Gewürz. It's dry and brisk, with soft, lemony acidity.",US-New York:Gewürztraminer

"Although this wine is labeled Brut, it is in fact right at the driest end of that category. Bone dry, therefore, while full of white fruits and crisp lemon zest flavors. The texture is tight, steely and speaks strongly of the chalk of the soil. It is still young, so this vintage wine can be drunk now for its fruitiness or left until 2016 for a more rounded, toasty character.",France-Champagne:Chardonnay
This nonvintage Riesling offers light apple flavors and a hint of spice.,US-Washington:Riesling
"Very ripe flavors of berries and figs dominate this Cab-centric Bordeaux blend, along with intriguing side notes suggesting melon and cassis, smoke and mocha. It's a big, sexy wine, its fruit flavors backed with thick, ripe, but chalky tannins. If there is a downside, it is that it comes off as a bit monolithic.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"This has aromas of medicinal herb, red berry and a whiff of adhesive bandage that carry over to the palate along with mature apple and a hint of orange zest. Bitter almond closes the finish.",Italy-Lombardy:Pinot Nero

"Floral in aromas and yet darkly savory in cherry and clove, this full-bodied wine holds layered acidity and balanced oak at its core.

Drink now through 2024.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Sunbaked plum and currant aromas are a touch spicy. In the mouth, this blend of 50% Monastrell, 25% Syrah and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon is full, tannic and mostly well balanced. Dense spicy plume and black-fruit plum flavors finish with rubbery grabby tannins.",Spain-Levante:Red Blend

"Named after the Knights Templar who were headquartered in the Tejo region of Portugal in the Middle Ages, this estate has produced a fruity, soft and rounded white wine. It has an attractively aromatic character from the inclusion of Riesling and Moscatel in the blend. Wait until the end of 2015 before drinking.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese White
"Roast beef, black currant, caked purple flowers, caramel and fudge come together on the wondrous nose of this blend of 75% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. Strong chocolate flavors kick off the palate, followed by blueberry, violet, espresso, dill and licorice, all clinging to sticky, mouthcoating tannins. It delivers lots of body and power.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"There's a slightly smoky, fume character to this wine's otherwise ripe aromas of stone fruit, melon and fig, giving an extra layer of complexity. And despite the ripe aromas, this wine is crisp and grassy on the palate, delivering a long finish with finely delineated flavors.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"This playful blend of air-dried white grapes (Prosecco and Incrocio Manzoni) offers simple aromas of honey and peach backed by some dried hay and citrus. Made with organically-grown grapes, this dessert wine is sweet and thick on the close.",Italy-Veneto:White Blend
"Vibrant aromas of spice, cranberry and plum lead into a vivid, juicy, youthful wine with plenty of tangy fruit. The acids are way out in front, but the fruit has a zip to it, and there is little or no suggestion of new wood to get in the way.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir

"This warm-climate Viura hits with plodding barrel aromas and flavors but there's not a lot of high-quality natural material to support that much faux/forced oak. Along the way it hints at mealy apple, spice, cinnamon powder and resin. A lot of noise but not much music.",Spain-Northern Spain:Viura
"There's a slightly scorched character to this wine that I had a tough time getting past. There's solid plummy fruit, but also recurring hints of freshly sawn lumber and burnt coffee. It's full bodied, with plenty of astringent tannins, so it might age past this current stage, and it's possible this rating could look stingy in a few years.",Australia-South Australia:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Chard did not go through malolactic fermentation, allowing the acidity to stand up to what otherwise would be an overripe wine. It's strong in tropical fruits, peaches, brown sugar, vanilla bean and buttered toast flavors that are soft, direct and one-dimensional.",US-California:Chardonnay
"There's a toothpasty sweetness to this Zin, like a raspberry mint candy. Also odd is that it's already throwing significant sediment even though it's still a young wine. Eccentric, but it has its charms.",US-California:Zinfandel

This is perfectly good, healthy and adequately fruity, yet woody.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"A designation used only when a vintage deserves, this reserve is definitely worthy. Almost a decade after bottling, it offers an intensity of chocolate, cinnamon and clove against soft, mellowed and structured tannin. Dusty sage and a bramble of blackberry complete the picture. It may have another five to seven years of beauty left within, but why wait?",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
This Nero d'Avola opens with a bright note of forest berry or bramble and continues with solid consistency and plush density. The tannins are polished and tight and the wine would pair with roasted chicken or pork.,Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nero d'Avola
"Fresh, with an attractive line of acidity that complements the spice and rich texture. It's dry on the finish, remaining crisp and ripe. This is a real food wine.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"Baked blackberry, vanilla, caramel and tar on the nose make for a very inviting entry into this rich Syrah from Bibiana González Rave, whose father-in-law, Gary Pisoni, co-developed this vineyard. A firm structure to the sip gives backbone to the lush flavors of dark berry, purple flowers, smoky campfire, maple and bacon fat.",US-California:Syrah

"Crisp, toasty aromas of black cherry and cassis are impressive. This is a full-bodied Malbec with edgy tannins that stop short of being hard. Berry, chocolate and woodspice flavors finish smooth, long and complex, with a welcome note of cedar. Drink through 2020.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec

"This huge, rich Zinfandel is ripe—nearly overripe—with dry raisin, blackberry and currant flavors. There's a curious bitterness to the finish that must come from the shriveled grape skins, which add to the wine's complexity. The vineyard is on the cooler, hillier western side of Paso Robles. Not a Zin for everyone, it's nevertheless a classic example of its genre.",US-California:Zinfandel
"A rare finding of this variety in California, this wine is golden-orange in color and offers resin-like sweetness that may not appeal to everybody.",US-California:Rosé

"The flint and chalk nature of the soil shows in this wine. From old vines well situated in the Premier Cru of Montmains, it has concentration and a tight, young texture that will need to develop. It is fresh and full of citrus now, although a riper, creamy character will be coming through as it matures. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay

"Cool rooty aromas of cola and tree bark grace the nose on this ripe but still not fully mature Cabernet Sauvignon (with 5% Merlot). In the mouth, this is choppy due to sandpaper tannins.

Drink or hold through 2022.",Spain-Northern Spain:Red Blend
"Initially this smells closed, charred, oaky and minty more than lush and fruity, but with airing things get reversed. The palate is rich, ripped and juicy, with excellent structure. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, spice and reedy tobacco finish dry, powerful and with a strong note of licorice. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain:Mencía
"This is great Petite Sirah, and classically Dry Creek Valley in style. It has the weight and texture of a fine Cabernet, with gorgeously smooth tannins, but it's the flavors that really make you reach for another glass.

It finishes with additional herbal kick and heat.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Carmenère

Defines the lighter style of California Pinot, in a gracious, elegant style.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Just four barrels were produced of this reserve, which sports a distinctive black label. The fruit is chunky and scented strongly with cinnamon. Even with extended airing, the wine feels diffuse, and the flavors thin out rather quickly. A bit disappointing given the vintage.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir

"Wild berry, dark spice and Mediterranean herb aromas lift out of the glass, accented by a whiff of new leather. The enveloping, full-bodied palate doles out fleshy black cherry, star anise, pipe tobacco and cinnamon notes, framed by chewy tannins. Drink 2020–2027.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese

Drink from 2019.",France-Southwest France:Malbec

"Too much volatility, and too much oak take over here, obliterating the fruit. As a result, flavors are thin, the finish sour.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon

It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"The third vintage of this wine is 100% varietal, with the fruit coming from Stone Tree, Cold Creek and Beverly vineyards. Aromas of coffee, vanilla, clove, dark plum and spice lead to concentrated, layered but still elegant fruit flavors.",US-Washington:Merlot
"From a very fine Port vineyard, this is an attractive wine from what is not a great Port vintage. It has perfumed fruits and gentle tannins that give a red fruit character to the wine. The wine is in a style that can almost be drunk young for its fruit, red plums and dried raisins spiced with acidity and a easy structure. Drink now, although for the true vintage Port experience, wait until 2025.",Portugal-Port:Port
"Very deep in color and spicy-smoky in flavor, this full-bodied wine is packed with dark-fruit flavors like blackberry and blueberry. Aromas like grilled beef and spicy flavors like cardamom and smoke give it a bold character that's hard to deny.",US-California:Red Blend
"Aromas of oak, stewed prune, raisin and a balsamic note lead the nose. The mature straightforward palate offers raspberry jam, black cherry extract and anise alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo

"This chalky-textured wine has bright, citrusy acidity to contrast its warmer tropical fruit character. Balanced and fruity, it will be ready to drink from late 2017.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese White

This wine has a jammy character with acidity that is unbalanced. Wine is made in cement tanks and aged in cement tanks and new and up to three-year-old French oak barrels.,France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Aromas of herbs, dates and licorice lead to reserved, silky-feeling flavors that show multiple layers and detail on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (59%), Merlot (26%) and Cabernet Franc. It's only ramps up with additional time in the glass.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Here's a wine that delivers big, ripe fruity tones such as sticky black cherry and blackberry comfiture but that leaves just enough room for those distinctive Sardinian notes of Mediterranean herbs. Pair this wine with red meat, especially lamb, and roasts.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Red Blend
"structured Brunello, it opens with aromas of forest floor, black berry, crushed flowers and mint. The palate delivers restrained wild cherry accented with clove and Mediterranean spices alongside bracing, tightly knit tannins that need to unwind. Drink 2016–2021.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Bright olallieberrries, fresh lilacs and crushed graphite show on the rather boisterous nose of this bottling. The wine is quite soft upon the sip, starting a tad sweet and then gaining more serious notes of oregano, tarragon, mint and anise, all presented with strong acidity.",US-California:Primitivo
"There is an initial smoky character, followed by a burst of ripe, rich black fruits, giving the wine weight and a dark, brooding core. Black plum and berry fruits, considerable acidity and a delicate final perfume flesh out this wine's character. For serious aging.",Portugal-Port:Port
"This is two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one-third Merlot, all sourced from the estate's DuBrul vineyard. It's drinking quite well, though clearly heading into secondary fruit flavors that reflect its ongoing maturation. Cherries, plums and cassis fruits mingle, along with silky, polished tannins. Though it can be cellared indefinitely, it may be at its most delicious drinking peak currently.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Named after famed Horse Heaven Hills grower Mimi Nye, this wine brings aromas of toast, custard and pineapple. Fruit and barrel flavors weave together on the palate, carrying through the finish.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"Soft notes of apple are bedded on a creamy, biscuity background of mellow richness. The structure of Pinot Noir shines through and makes for an elegant if not overly fruited wine. Fine bubbles make for a very smooth mouthfeel, all the way to the dry, refreshing finish.",France-Alsace:Pinot Noir
"Richness and ripeness are welcome traits in this full-bodied, generously flavored and smoothly textured wine. Prune and blackberry aromas continue into the palate and linger a bit on the finish.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Mourvèdre is a very difficult variety to get right, but Venteux's 2010 is right up there with the state's best. It's dry and medium bodied, with complex cherry, mocha, licorice and bacon flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Might even gain some traction with 2–3 years in the cellar.",US-California:Mourvèdre
"A strong, smoky set of aromas gets this going in the proper direction. There's also spice, earth, herbal aromas and leather to give it variety. The palate is deep and big, with blackberry, smoked meat and richness. Smooth on the finish, with black olive and additional herbal accents.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Carmenère

"Full-bodied and robust, this has the tannicly rustic nature of an old-fashioned red. It is completely dry, with earthy flavors of dark stone fruits, currants, coffee, licorice, herbs and pepper.",US-California:Zinfandel
"J has taken the unusual step of blending Pinot Noir with Pinot Meunier, which is not so strange, but also with Pinotage, which is practically unheard of. The addition of the latter certainly makes the wine darker, heavier and more tannic than it ordinarily would be. It also brings an earthiness to Pinot's vibrant cherries. It's an oddball, but a charming one to drink with rich winter stews.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"From a multi-aspected, redwood-surrounded site with peeks of the Pacific Ocean, Stuller traffics in aromas of baked bread and strawberry preserves, its acidity high-toned and full of freshness. Still young and looking for further development in the glass, it's savory and soft, aged in once-to-four-times used French oak.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"This broad wine has apple and pear flavors and a smooth texture. It's all ripe and creamy fruit, with well-balanced acidity.",France-France Other:Chardonnay
"Ripe grape jelly notes lead this big-boned Shiraz, followed by licorice and dry, brittle oak. The acid and tannins are in balance on the palate, while the oak is a little prominent. Despite that, plenty of juicy fruit follows through to the finish. Drink now–2022.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz

"A 100% varietal wine, this features big oak and dry tannins around a rustic core of full-bodied black cherry and dried plum. Savory tobacco and tea provide a sultry edge to the proceedings, before tartness comes to bear on the finish. Enjoy now through 2018.",US-California:Sangiovese

"A big, modern-style contender with burly berry, lemon, coconut, dill and blackberry on the bouquet. Lush and cushioned in the mouth, with meaty, dark flavors of roasted blackberry, espresso and fudge. Chewy and dense on the finale, but not overly hard or tannic. Drink now through 2015.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tinta de Toro
"The artist label Syrah is usually Dunham's best, as this vineyard is well-established as one of the premier sites in Washington for Syrah. Scents of violets and black cherry introduce a dense, hard, tightly wound, muscular effort that needs a generous amount of breathing time. It rolls through the palate on a train of well-defined fruit, spice and chocolate, all nicely integrated. Supple and long.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Closed aromatically at first, this medium-bodied wine develops dark plum and cocoa notes amidst a juicy mid palate. Dusty tannins end things nicely. There's not a lot of red wine out there of this quality at this price.",US-California:Red Blend
"Shapely and balanced, this bright Brunello shows a clean style that is reinforced by pristine aromas of forest fruit, cranberry, white cherry, cola, ginger and a spicy touch of ground white pepper. Bright acidity creates a cooling sensation in the mouth and would pair well with creamy or cheesy pasta dishes.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"This crisp wine has plenty of acidity as well as lively fruits. The structure and texture are light and lifted, with a clean aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This expression is beautifully integrated and balanced, with notes of forest fruit and cassis that are set against touches of tar, licorice, brown sugar and cola. The lush and opulent finish delivers an impressive load of dark chocolate and exotic spice.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Rich in spicy, briary berry-cherry and chocolate fruit, with ultra-smooth tannins, and just enough acidity to cut through barbecue sauce. It's a bit sweet and Porty on its own.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This wine inspires a pairing with foods that have a sweet cheese or butter element. It is well shaped and opulent, with loads of crushed black pepper, dried fruit and  dusty mineral nuances.",Italy-Southern Italy:Aglianico
"This is a lovely, well-crafted wine from a fine site in the heart of the appellation, originally planted by Jim Barbour. It opens with richly inviting vanilla cream and clarified butter notes before soft tannin and subtle oak come into play. The fruit is lively, with strawberry and cherry flavors.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Caramel and butter dominate the flavor mix, imparting the suggestion of movie popcorn and buttered toast, partially balanced by crisp pineapple and citrus fruit.",Australia-Western Australia:Chardonnay
This easygoing off-dry Riesling boasts pretty orange blossom and white-peach perfume. Crisp stone-fruit flavors on the palate are accented by honey and bee pollen. The finish is long and zesty.,US-New York:Riesling
"This is an ebullient wine, full of herb, grapefruit and wet-earth aromas as well as very tangy yet sweet-seeming citrus flavors. It has good concentration and stays fresh through the finish.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"A wine made in dedication from a loving wife to her husband, Andretta opens with dark concentration and generous aromas of dark licorice, cherry fruit, leather, tobacco, teriyaki and spice. The inky color is dark and daunting, but the wine is actually more nuanced and elegant than you'd expect, with balanced acidity and fine tannins.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"This is Syrah with great purity of fruit, especially blueberry. The fruit is thick and tongue-coating, though well positioned with supporting acidity. It's a rich, supple wine with tannins and acids that are refined and in perfect proportion.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Big and solid, this is very firm in character. It has weight, density and dry tannins. At the same more juicy black fruits and acidity emerge from this mineral textured wine. Powered by its structure, it could well age for 3–5 years.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Named after a green oak (Eouve in the local Provencal language), this wine is brightly aromatic, with a caramel flavor and tight acidity. The 15% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend has given the wine some structure, which needs to soften a little. Drink from late 2017.",France-Provence:Rosé
The wine has a fine smoky character lying over the blackberry fruits. It has the potential to be rich with generous fruits and balanced tannins. The aftertaste is juicy and crisp.,France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Superripe Merlot has pushed up the alcohol in this wine. It gives a rich, opulent texture of blackberry jam flavors that are well balanced by the acidity and perfumed character. The broad, generous character gets a fresh lift from the final acidity. Drink from 2018. This Guinjard family wine is 95% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon from a 19-acre vineyard.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"It takes a while for the friendly, pure pear fruit to show itself. Once apparent, it shines and is wonderfully sunny, light and balanced. Fresh acidity brightens and lifts everything and makes the fruit flavors finish dry with overtones of green apple.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"Mar de Palha (seaweed) is a reminder of the closeness of the ocean to the Chocapalha estate. This is a rich, wood-aged wine, full of dark plum and berry fruits with almost-sweet tannins. It's ready to drink in a rich, young fruit way, although it will be even better from 2016.",Portugal-Lisboa:Portuguese Red
"While there is some botrytis here, this wine is not heavily into that style. Rather it shows freshness, with its white currant and grapefruit acidity and delicate perfume. There is a fine core of sweet apple skin tannins to finish.",France-Southwest France:White Blend
"Sourced from the Hop Kiln Vineyard on Westside Road, this crisp, creamy white is seductive and balanced, a refreshing sip of white peach and almond. Aromatic in honeysuckle and orange blossom, it leaves a suggestion of exotic spice on the finish.",US-California:Pinot Gris

"With flavors of wild blackberry and cherry, pepper, cinnamon, currant and heady cassis, this is a classic example of warm-climate Zin. It's high in alcohol and a little soft, but it is delicious. Serve it at a barbeque with burgers, ribs, chops, chicken and sausages.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Ripe berry, new leather, dark spice and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find in this full-bodied red. The firm palate offers black cherry, fresh mint and clove set against a backbone of fine-grained tannins that lend polish and structure. It's already impressive but will continue to develop. Drink 2020–2030.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"An overtone of leesy yeast quickly gives way to lemony freshness, rounded out by hints of yellow plum and peach. Citrus also continues to be the focus on the palate: fresh zest of ripe lemons and Meyer lemons just edged by peppery spice. This is taut and very linear, streamlined, concentrated and slender but still tightly wound. This will relax into more spice and fruit with a little while in bottle. Right now it is a zesty, evocative mouthful of promise.",Austria-Wachau:Grüner Veltliner
"This Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre blend shows hot alcohol and superripe flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate and raisins. It's a big, rich, thick wine that sticks to the gums, almost syrupy, but fully dry. Decant it and drink with stews, casseroles, barbecue.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is the winery's reserve bottling, representing the best five barrels of the vintage. Supple and refined, it frames its young berry fruit flavors in elegant tannins. Nicely focused and still a bit raw, this wine will reward some further years of aging.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"An ambitious wine that aims for the fences and hits a double. It's soft and super-fruity, with the sweet, extracted flavors of blackberries and cherries, liberally enhanced with oak, that characterize modern Napa cult-style Cabs. But it lacks some depth and complexity, especially at this inflated price.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sourced from several vineyards within the AVA, this shows lightly peppery Bing cherries with streaks of sassafras, cola and dark chocolate. The wine gains amplitude and weight as it breathes open. The finish brings flavors of cherry pie and a hint of butter.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This is a meaty and mature Negroamaro with ripe notes of black olive, earth and leather. It has raw, gritty tannins and chewy succulence with some bitter cherry on the close.",Italy-Southern Italy:Negroamaro
"Concentrated, inky and charred on the nose, this is a ripe and heady Rioja with strong barrel influences. Blackberry, cassis and roasted black-plum flavors are appropriate given the wine's hefty build. Finishing flavors of coffee, bitter chocolate and baking spices are long and thorough. Drink this powerful Tempranillo-led blend through 2030.",Spain-Northern Spain:Red Blend
"A heavy, powerful wine, with very concentrated tannins. Flavors of licorice, bitter chocolate and black plums give a sense of richness and opulence. Still young, the aromas are yeasty, but these should open up for a rich, dense wine.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this opulent wine opens with aromas of black currant, graphite and baking spice. The juicy concentrated palate delivers black cherry, blackberry, tobacco and licorice framed in bold polished tannins. Drink now through 2023.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"This is so chocolaty and rich, it's impossible to resist a second or third glass. Although it's heady in alcohol, there's an excellent burst of acidity, and the texture is pure velvet. The blackberry tart, orange zest, spice and sandalwood flavors change continuously as the wine warms in the glass.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"This wine offers light medicinal aromas followed by red raspberry, cherry and woodspice. It's creamy in feel and richly flavorful, with smooth tannins and a finish that lingers.",US-Washington:Cabernet Franc
"Thistle makes a spicy, herbal, earthy style of Pinot Noir, so don't look for sweet, ripe, jammy flavors. The fruit tastes like the tart, wild berries of the Northwest, and it's backed with tart acidity and chewy tannins. But the concentration, focus and detail of the wine elevate it, and it persists in the mouth far longer than you anticipate.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This smooth wine has plenty of varietal character, from the grassy, citrus-like aromas to the lemon and green-apple flavors. Balanced and flavorful, it should pair well with seafood, goat cheese and other food choices.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Very ripe in blackberries and cherries, with a nice coating of toasty oak, with a long, spicy finish. The texture is a bit aggressive, with sandpapery tannins. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink now–2015.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Woodsy spicy black-fruit aromas include notes of balsam wood. This is deep and layered but not too heavy; flavors of chocolaty oak, peppercorn and blackberry finish with a rich helping of oak-based mocha and coffee. Drink through 2020.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Carmenère
"Leesy fleshy papaya aromas come with a touch of sulfur and harshness. This feels solid, albeit modest in bubbles. Flavors of apple and green melon are lasting and steady on the finish.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"A rich, bacony, black fruit monster with deep, molten flavors and immense body and tannic grab. A bruising wine with boysenberry, blackberry, mint, licorice and chocolate for primary flavors, and then lemony oak as a backdrop. Young, tannic and wild now; best from 2011 through 2015.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
The nose of juicy plum promises ripe fruit. The palate follows with a generous softness. There is ease on this light body and lots of freshness. Enjoy while aromas are at their peak.,France-Alsace:Pinot Blanc
"Lightly spicy and quite refreshing, this is a gentle wine, with a mix of melon and white peach fruit. Simple but perfect for every day.",US-Washington:Pinot Gris
"One of the producer's more delicate offerings, this wine from a coastal site is crisp and crunchy in wet stone, black tea and light-bodied renderings of red cherry and pomegranate. Along the way it tells a tale of citrus tanginess and sculptured minerality, finishing with the slightest backbone of textured tannin.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Condensed up front, with aromas of berry compote and molasses. So why is this so tangy and tart in the mouth? Maybe the grapes weren't as ripe as they seem from the nose, and in the end it fails the all-important balance/wholesomeness test.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Sharp scents of saddle leather lead into a tannic, earthy wine that remains stubbornly closed even after some hours.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Reticent aromas of kiwi and herb are followed by tart, medium bodied citrus flavors. The concentration isn't as dense as it could be.",US-Washington:Sauvignon Blanc
"Though low in alcohol even by David Hill standards, this excellent Pinot Gris does not lack fruit or flavor. Ripe and tasting of pretty pear and orange fruit, it shows evidence of some well-balanced residual sugar. Vivid acidity cuts through to a satisfying finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Gris

"Light cream, peach and malolactic aromas lead to a medium-bodied nuanced palate. It has plenty of subtleties to explore, with a finish that stretches out.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"An abundance of everything marks this best-barrel selection, which always is the winery's most expensive Chardonnay. The richness of the tropical fruit and apricot flavors is obvious. So is the oak. The result is as opulent a Chardonnay as California is capable of producing, but one that, awesome as it is, nonetheless lacks the interest of Testarossa's single-vineyard Chardonnays.",US-California:Chardonnay
"A very perfumed, fragrant and refreshing wine. It is full in the mouth, ripe, smelling of hedgerow blossoms and having a touch of spring in its fruits. Ready to drink, but also keep until 2016.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"This late harvest wine shows both intense acidity and intense richness. Honey, perfumed lemon and ripe apple notes come together. Still young, it's going to need time for the acidity to soften, so wait to drink until 2020.",France-Southwest France:Petit Manseng

"This wine is calm and cool. It tastes very smooth in texture and has soothing, simple fruit flavors and medium body.",US-California:Pinot Blanc
"This is the kind of wine Franciscan produces so well and reliably. As far as Merlots go, it shows the soft approachability and supple tannins you expect. Flavorwise, it's appealing in ripe red cherries, sweet red licorice and smoky oak. A very nice restaurant wine, and easy to find, with more than 20,000 cases produced.",US-California:Merlot
"Another terrific value from the Costières de Nîmes, this features exquisite scents of grilled herbs—think thyme, rosemary, lavender—with ripe blueberries and roasted meat. It's open-knit and velvety on the palate already, so drink it now through 2018.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend

"Soft and a bit sweet in jammy blackberries and cherries, with lots of pepper. Compromised by some unripe green mint flavors.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Full-bodied, complex and delicious, with extraordinarily ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, chocolate, grilled meat, tamari, violets, sweet fresh herbs and black pepper. Quite dry and tannic now, with a youthful, primary fruit character that suggests ageability. Best 2010–2012.",US-California:Syrah
"This is the blended Bordeaux from Calvet, one of the oldest wine names in the city. It's full and ripe, a rounded wine that has good berry fruits as well as a drier, firmer core. At the end, a more smoky character appears.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This majority-Syrah was fermented with a tiny handful of Viognier, both grown on a certified-organic estate vineyard. With a touch of licorice and leather in the mix, it offers funk that may or may not be of interest to every palate and should be enjoyed sooner rather than later.",US-California:Syrah
"This is soft, with candy and raspbery flavors. Its acidity offers some freshness along with light sweetness on the finish. Drink now.",France-Provence:Rosé
"Rubbery black-fruit aromas come with a distinct and strong whiff of bacon. In the mouth, this is full, angular and highly tannic. A bacon-like flavor leads plum and saucy tomato notes, while this is chunky and scrubbing on the finish, with a flavor of clove.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fresh and full of lime on the nose, and overall this is simple, smooth and gives you little reason to worry or fuss. The palate is smooth, creamy and a little low on acids, thus the lemon-lime and melon flavors have a fullness that's sweet and good.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"A rich blend that features toasty oak, vanilla and butterscotch on the nose. On the palate, it serves up a pleasing lineup of melon, apple, honey, spice and toast flavors. Creamy rich on the finish, fleshy and seductive. -J.M.",US-California:Chardonnay
"A blend of Pinot Noir and Touriga Nacional, crisply flavored with raspberries and fresh acidity. A dry rosé, which finishes with a bright lift.",Portugal-Bairrada:Portuguese Red

"The nose on this wine from the Willow Creek area plays between the lighter elements of bright red cherries and heavier hints of tar, with a bit of sour plum thrown in as well. The palate is loaded with chalky tannins, offering flavors of black cherries and licorice, but it could use some more time in bottle.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is the prototype for an over-the-top, roasted, charred Tempranillo. The nose smells directly of burnt coffee, charcoal and grilled beef. It's super-chunky on the tongue, with dominating roasted black fruit flavors. It has its merits but is still too blackened for our liking.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"This is a GSM blend—about two-thirds Syrah—loaded with juicy acidity. The sappy, deep raspberry fruit sinks into the palate, racy and penetrating. It suggests that this is a wine to cellar for awhile. At the moment it suddenly hits a hard stop—a wall of slate and graphite.",US-Washington:G-S-M
"A rich, ripe wine, striated with yellow fruits, acidity and spice from wood. It is warm and generous, while not losing sight of its origins in the streak of minerality. A fine, attractive wine that could do with another year's aging.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"From this top Bergerac producer comes this powerful blend. With its 30% Malbec, it has intense tannins and a firm, solid structure, with dense and richly concentrated blackberry fruit. It does need to age for at least five years.",France-Southwest France:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Smoky oak renderings segue into aromas of prune, raisin, black tea and mature berry fruit. You'll also get spice and a touch of maple syrup, molasses and smoked beef jerky on the nose. The tannins are firm and thick and have been shaped by the hot Sicilian sunshine.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nero d'Avola

"This shows cranberry and herb aromas, along with a floral top note. The palate comes off as sweet and liquorous, with lightly grainy tannins providing support.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"The “least” of Lane Tanner's range of Pinots, but complex and delicious. Ripe berry and spice flavors are rich, and there's a tangy earthiness suggesting sauteed mushrooms. Very dry and crisp, with a silky texture and a long, smooth finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Medium-bodied and a little viscous in the mouth, this value Chard is no fruit bomb, as are many others at this price. It's rather interesting—look for white stone fruit and floral notes on the palate, and peach and passion fruit notes on the nose. Finishes with a peppery-herbaceous bite.",Australia-Australia Other:Chardonnay
"Briny aromas of oyster shell blend with green onion, lime and matchstick scents on this sulfuric-smelling SB. Tangy and round, with an oily note to the mouthfeel, this tastes of salty lime, tangerine, saline solution and pickle brine.",Chile-Leyda Valley:Sauvignon Blanc

"Nottingham's biggest Cab production at 375 cases, this is a mix of Cabs from four different Livermore Valley vineyards, including three that Nottingham vineyard designates, and about half the price. But spring for the good stuff. This still-closed Cab, with small percentages of Petite Sirah, Merlot and Syrah, is very herbal and savory, with plenty of tannin and tobacco.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Steel and honey meld from nose to finish in this light-footed dry Riesling. The palate boasts spine-tingling lime and lemon flavors intensified by a concentrated sheen of petrol. It's a spry, deeply mineral wine that finishes with remarkable persistence.",Germany-Rheingau:Riesling
"Voluptuous white peach and lighter butter notes form a classic nose set against a chalky backbone of lemon verbena and pink apple skins. The palate is tightly knit with lime skins, quinine and pink grapefruit pith, proving versatile and tartly acid-driven in style.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Intriguing aromas of white spring flower, ripe orchard fruit and a smoky whiff of gunflint lift out of the glass. The polished palate delivers juicy white peach, green apple, white almond a mineral note suggesting wet stone. It's a lovely wine.",Italy-Lombardy:Turbiana
"Light and smoky, this is a fruit-forward, soft wine. Berry flavors are balanced by the stalky texture. It's young, although very ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley:Cabernet Franc
"This lovely Verdicchio has the wine's trademark floral fragrance of broom and acacia flowers, along with a whiff of beeswax. The rich palate boasts creamy apple, yellow peach and tropical fruit flavors accompanied by energizing mineral notes and crisp acidity.",Italy-Central Italy:Verdicchio
"This opens with aromas suggesting underbrush, scorched earth, chopped herb and dried berry. The straightforward palate delivers concentrated black cherry, black currant and dark spice set against rounded tannins. A coffee note signals the close.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"This is very flavorful, fruity and full bodied. It maintains a sleek texture in spite of considerable tannins that keep it feeling dry. Aromas are like wild berries and cherry blossoms, the flavors are exotic and very ripe, and the finish keeps adding more fruit nuances.",US-California:Red Blend
"This wine is dark garnet in the glass, with aromas of raspberry and boysenberry that set the palate up for flavors of eucalyptus, thyme, oregano and black cherry. The flavor profile leans a little too far towards the herbal end of the spectrum, but it is ultimately a pleasant and easy-drinking wine.",Israel-Galilee:Merlot
"The ripeness of the grapes ran away in this wine, so that despite high alcohol, it still retains what tastes like residual sugar. The result is an excessively sweet wine. It's almost like a minor Port.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Here's your basic Sierra Zin, slightly sweet and rustic, with edgy tannins and minty, green pepper flavors. Riper notes of blackberries, cherries and raspberries help the score.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Showing the hard tannins and dryness of a young Petite Sirah, this is the kind of wine you normally would cellar. But there's a little streak of green unripeness that suggests aging will lead nowhere. So drink it now with big, lusty fare.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"This wine is no shrinking violet on the nose, resplendent in fresh roses and strawberry-raspberry. It confounds in its ability to provide huge flavor and personality while retaining a freshness and high level of acidity on the palate. A leathery, savory component speaks quietly amid the suggestions of cinnamon and cigar.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Light-bodied and yet offering a depth of complexity, this is resplendent in rhubarb and spicy anise, layered and textured in silky waves of fleshy flavor. A well balanced and approachable selection that's enjoyable now.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Firmly tannic wine, with balancing ripe fruit well under the structured layers. The weight of the wine comes from the rich and generous black plum fruit and acidity. A wine for long-term aging.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Soft and fruity, this is an attractive red-fruit flavored wine. It has touches of spice over the bright acidity and red-currant fruit. The tannins are still young although not enough to subdue the spirits of the lively fruit. Drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley:Cabernet Franc
"Ripe, densely structured wine, balancing tannins, acidity and red plum and cherry fruit flavors. There's a strong mineral edge here, a wine that needs 2–3 years of aging, to round out its edges.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Dark, gummy and full of heavily applied green oak, this wine has a candied, murky, resiny persona. And that's too bad, because it has potential; yet the tannins, wood resin, mesquite and beefy black fruit are all too dominant and thus it never settles or shows much harmony.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Fay's expression of Nebbiolo (locally known as Chiavennasca) offers distinctive aromas of lead pencil, chopped mint, rosemary, forest floor and leafy bramble. The mineral backbone is impressive and lends a sensation of purity and elegance. Age this beauty for 10 years or more.",Italy-Lombardy:Nebbiolo
"Intense yellow stone fruit, grapefruit, smoky flint and nutmeg aromas jump out of the glass. The bright, generous palate doles out juicy apricot, mature peach and orange zest notes, framed by tangy acidity. A mineral note lifts the lingering finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Kerner
"Here's an Amarone with raw notes of cherry and root beer backed by mesquite smoke, spice, leather and cigar box. It's a very sweet, succulent wine with soft tannins and a long, chewy finish.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This is one of the drier, more structured Merlots from any Napa appellation in recent memory. Far from being a soft, gooey fruit bomb, its marked by big-time tannins, with herb, leather, olive tapenade, cherry and dark unsweetened chocolate flavors. It might strike fruit fans as austere, but true aficionados will recognize a great mountain wine of enormous complexity.",US-California:Merlot
"Smooth as silk, all estate-grown, this classy Pinot lists five Dijon clones, Pommard, Wadenswil and “Suitcase clone La Tache” on its tech sheet. Vibrant and spicy, with cherries galore (sounds like a James Bond heroine) and a round, full, lush and satisfying mouthfeel. This is the one to drink now, while you cellar the Cuvée Giselle.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Airy and creamy aromas of sliced pluot, Asian pear, fresh orange rind and a touch of wet bread make for a compelling and zesty bubbly. The sip starts with a citrusy tang, continues with riper flashes of nectarine on the midpalate and shows a yeasty wash throughout. There's serious textural grip to the palate.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"Soupy berry aromas with cheesy oak notes make for an earthy, challenging nose. This feels full, grabby and highly tannic. Medicinal berry and cherry flavors are accented by brown-sugar sweetness and chocolaty spice on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Citrus and apple flavors dominate this tight, mineral, crisp wine. It has a refreshing feel with acidity that's well integrated into the fruitiness, as well as a light texture. Drink now.",France-Alsace:Sparkling Blend
"A new take on Harveys Bristol Cream. Instead of you adding a twist of orange with the final pour, they've done it for you. But as with many infused drinks, the aromas are kind of artificial and the flavors run straight to candied and never come back. Worth a go if you like orange as a lead flavor—serve on the rocks.",Spain-Andalucia:Sherry
"This is an easy, extremely thin Valpolicella that offers bright cherry and berry aromas and a lean, citrusy finish. Those informal qualities gear this wine to a pairing with cheesy pizza and sausage.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This is a good, dry wine with moderate fruit flavors, a straightforward texture and medium body. It has mild lemon and apple notes in the aroma and on the palate.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"This beautifully balanced wine has a fine texture of steely acidity and ripe fruit tones. Like many Pouilly-Fumé wines, it needs time to mature further to bring out the great fruit and the fine structure that will make this an impressive wine. Drink from 2018",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Stalky, herbal aromas infiltrate mild red-berry scents. This is crisp, juicy and light on the palate, with tart strawberry, cherry and raspberry flavors. A touch of oak and cocoa powder appear on a lightweight finish.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Pinot Noir
"From parcels of old vines in the Côte des Blancs, this limited-edition wine is a beautiful Chardonnay. It is finely woven, tightly textured and crisp in apple skin and lemon notes. Concentration from the low-yielding vines gives great depth and the potential to still age well. Drink this exceptional wine from 2017.",France-Champagne:Chardonnay
"Made in a light but complex style, this is a delightful Merlot to drink with just about anything that calls for a full-bodied red wine. It's dry and elegant, with an herbal tinge to the cherries and tobacco.",US-California:Merlot
"A yeasty nose smells all right but somewhat artificial and not that fruity. A low-acid palate has flavors of melon and grape skins, but the total package seems a touch nutty and prematurely stale. A flat finish is consistent with what came before.",Spain-Northern Spain:Rosé
"This is Sojourn's most successful 2010 Pinot Noir, because it's the ripest and most satisfying. It shows rich, tantalizing raspberry, cherry and cola flavors that are brightened by brisk acidity. It earns extra points for its complexity.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"With its light color and cool feel, this well-balanced wine comes from a parcel of 30-year-old vines. The smoky tannins and intense acidity give a wine that will develop well and slowly. It's still young with its red-berry fruits and fresh aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",France-Loire Valley:Pinot Noir
"This full-flavored blend is 65% Grenache and the balance is mostly Syrah, with a little Mourvèdre. It opens with a rustic nose and full earthy, horsey flavors. There’s a very typical Rhône-ish brambly quality to the dark-berry fruit, and the finish is long and flavorful. Quite approachable right now; it should drink well for the next 4 to 8 years, maybe longer.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Earthy, youthful aromas lead to a wine that's ripe while still finding its fruity character. The potential for the citrus and apricot flavors is there and should develop by mid-2015.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese White
"A blend of 60% Sangiovese and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has aromas of sunbaked earth, dried herb, dark berry and a whiff of underbrush. The soft straightforward palate offers juicy black cherry and a hint of spice framed in easygoing tannins. Drink soon.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"A rugged wine, with harsh tannins and a green, unripe taste to the cherry-berry flavors.",US-California:Red Blend
"Very funky and confounding at first, but then it opens to reveal smoke, stone fruit and mineral aromas. The mouth is quite spicy, with green herbs accenting citrus and mineral. The tangy lemon finish has a chalky grip to it, which only adds to the overall complexity of this unique Napa white.",US-California:Fumé Blanc
"A full, fleshy, lushly fruited Pinot Noir, streaked with espresso and caramel from barrel aging. The fruit and overall structure are up to the challenge of the wood; lots of black cherry and even hints of cassis running through the core. A finish with some noticeable heat supports the 15.4% alcohol reading, but it's a tasty bottle of wine.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Albariño is not known for its aging potential, and this fairly stale offering from 2010 is proof that the textbook is correct. Aromas of white fruits, corn and hay set up a chunky palate with flavors of melon and mango that are yeasty and slightly oxidized.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño
"Simple and sweet, this Primitivo has jammy flavors of black raspberries, cherries and chocolate. It's a little heavy and soft.",US-California:Primitivo

"This is a layered and complex estate-driven wine. Its firm, sizable tannin foundation promises longevity and enviable structure, while allowing for a plush, lush exuberance of cherry clafoutis, cardamom and salted caramel. Enjoy best 2022 through 2029.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"The cool Côte de Lechet, facing north, produces a classically steely Chablis. This is still young, very tight and nervy, its acidity prominent even though the texture is ripe. Aging will bring balance between the crisp character and the richer green and white fruits. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"With a ruby-clear color and a light mouthfeel, this low-alcohol Pinot also is a little light in flavor. The cherries and red currants are compromised by a problematic mushroom taste.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is a strawberry-pink-colored wine with candied flavors balanced by acidity. It is fruity, crisp and light in character.",France-Bordeaux:Rosé
"This is a fantastic and confident Sauvignon with penetrating notes of chopped herbs, white peppercorn and mint backed by luscious exotic fruit. The wine is unreserved and direct and imparts a creamy, smooth feel in the mouth with a zesty, spicy finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon
"92-94 Concentrated tannins, very rich, very firm, very dry at this stage. There is a more juicy character underneath, offering the potential of rich berry fruits. There's a new wood, smoky aftertaste.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Only 120 cases of this wine from the Sonoma Coast, where cool weather limits ripeness. There are Burgundian aromas of grilled meat, raw meat and mushroom, with dark berries. Very dry, but with a glyceriney sweetness, it's light and supple on the palate. Might age; might not. This is still unexplored territory for Pinot Noir.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Here is a dark, smoky, meaty Syrah, smooth in the mouth and showing plenty of black cherry fruit. The silkiness plays nicely against flavors that are dark with olive, espresso and cacao, and highlighted with hints of orange peel and pepper.",US-Washington:Syrah
"This is classic in herbaceous aromas and flavors, rich in juicy blackberry and blueberry while also offering savory pencil shavings and dark chocolate. Leathered, firm tannins complete the picture, providing structure and integration to a wall of well-managed oak.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Raw herbal spicy aromas come with a heavy draping of savory oak. This Bonarda feels full, rustic and a touch creamy. Dry spicy barrel-heavy flavors outweigh fruit on this oaky smoky red wine.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Bonarda
"This pleasant and straightforward Chardonnay comes in a hock bottle for no apparent reason. It's accented with pine needle aromas and flavors of resin and crisp apple. Forward and fruity, the time in barrel seems to have mostly just rounded it off, without adding noticeable flavors.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"Light strawberry fruit is heavily cloaked in flavors of butter and toast from eight months in oak. The wood flavors cover but do not entirely mask the bitter herbal notes, and the tannins seem disjointed and not fully integrated.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"As with many Margaux in 2007, this wine is all fruit, very little tannin. That brings out the attractive black currant flavors, but does mean that it is likely to be mature in the short term.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This blend of 45% Cabernet Franc, 44% Merlot and 11% Cabernet Sauvignon impresses with its accents of dried herbs, cherry and bittersweet chocolate. It's palate-coating in feel, with a dazzling sense of texture backed by fine-grained tannins.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Smooth and pleasantly herbal, this is a silky wine with a mix of blueberry, plum and cherry fruit. It spent 20 months in barrel, which lends a light chocolate note to the fruit. Velvety, delicate and most delightful, it should be consumed while it retains its youthful freshness.",US-Oregon:Merlot
"Sengia Rossa is a blend of Corvina, Rondinella, Merlot and other varieties that shows plush, rich concentration and a soft, velvety feel. Aromas here include black cherry, cassis, leather, tobacco and a touch of licorice.",Italy-Veneto:Red Blend
"Big and bold in character, this full-bodied and abundantly tannic wine looks black to the rim and smells like pencil shavings, leather and wood smoke. The flavors are dry but enticing, with dark chocolate, charred beef and black cherry. It needs until at least 2022 to peak.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"Amarone Alteo is a dark, savory red wine with masculine aromas of spice, tobacco, leather, licorice and loads of jammy fruit and black currant. In fact, the brightness of the fruit is ultimately what distinguishes this lush, powerful (with 17.5% alcohol) blend.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This wine presents aromas of flowers and purple fruit that are almost animalistic in nature. The palate boasts bright acidity and firm but far from inaccessible tannins. It's the purity, however, that most impresses.",US-Washington:Petite Sirah
"Mt. Difficulty's Pinots have resisted the trend toward ever-softer textures, even in this, the winery's entry-level bottling. Instead, the wine is firmly structured. Savory, dark-skinned plum fruit is accented by plenty of briary spice. Drink from 2014–2020.",New Zealand-Central Otago:Pinot Noir
"Coming in an oddly shaped, presumably old-style bottle, this blend of 51% Syrah, 39% Grenache, 7% Alicante Bouschet and 3% Petite Sirah packs a deep, rich nose full of blueberry syrup, vanilla and nutmeg, almost approaching brandy. Framed by a solid tannic structure, flavors hover on cola and cherries before hitting the spearmint-powered finish.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Leather, truffle, baked plum and a whiff of cake spice lead the nose on this robust, accessible wine. The meaty, monolithic palate also has rustic charm and juicy appeal, offering fleshy wild cherry, raspberry confiture, anise and chopped herb alongside chewy tannins. Drink sooner rather than later.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"An estate-grown 81% Merlot (the rest Cabernet Sauvignon), this wine takes time to come around in the glass, the alcohol overpowering the fruit at first. But in time, the red fruit and soft tannins mellow and make themselves known and this mostly-Merlot becomes a savory, food-friendly quaff.",US-California:Merlot
"Here is an intense and powerful Primitivo with a burnt note of popcorn and toasted nut backed by maple syrup and cooked plums. The density is not too heavy, which helps render this wine more approachable and food friendly.",Italy-Southern Italy:Primitivo
"This wine is hugely robust in concentration and power, a study in mountain-grown brambly berry and serious tannin. Bark, pencil and a wealth of spiced plum form the core of its character, with secondary elements of cherry and cigar box coming into play over time. Enjoy best beginning in 2024 through 2034.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Sagrantino passito offers a thick, austere nose that is ripe with notes of blackberry pie, plum cake, Indian spice, bramble and delicate nut. You can taste the tannins that are characteristic of this variety and that give the wine its heft and structure. Pair it with aged pecorino.",Italy-Central Italy:Sagrantino
"A savory blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of scorched earth, meat juices, leather, black fruit and spices. The dense, low-acid palate delivers black currants and fleshy black cherry accented with black pepper and mocha alongside soft, round tannins. Drink now through 2017.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"A vivid peach color telegraphs that this is not your ordinary Pinot Gris. The wine smells like peach skin and prosciutto, and is light bodied but steeped in exotic flavors of dried flowers, apricot and sea salt. It has a firm mouthfeel, noticeable astringency and an almost meaty character. It's not for the faint of heart, but fascinating.",US-California:Pinot Gris
"Jammy in orange, apricot and pineapple fruits, this Chard has an overlay of oak that brings notes of sweet buttered toast and vanilla. It's a simple wine, but has fine acidity.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Lombrone Riserva is an earthy, nicely concentrated wine that needs more time to age and integrate. It shows great structure with tight tannins and a long, beautiful finish characterized by cherry and delicate spicy shadings.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This single-vineyard wine, rounded and rich, is smooth, spicy and full of quince and lychee flavors that are developing well. Concentrated and dense, it will be best in late 2014.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"Among the four Rieslings designated as off dry, this shows the most sweetness on the palate, with a slightly granular mouthfeel, like crystallized cane sugar. It accents the round fruit flavors of Meyer lemon and satsuma orange, which overflow the midpalate and run into a lingering finish with a touch of orange pekoe tea.",US-Oregon:Riesling
"Meaty and leathery, with sweet, salty bacon notes meshing with intense wild blackberry fruit, this Syrah is delicious and sexy. The tannins are wonderfully plush and refined, like satin. It's perfect to drink now with short ribs of beef or any kind of beef or lamb stew.",US-California:Syrah
"A reserve-level vineyard selection, this incorporates a bit of the stiff, herbal character common in this AVA. Chewy fruit is balanced against firm tannins and succulent acids. This will benefit from another couple of years in the bottle.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This lovely expression of the grape blends in 21% Sémillon, adding a juicy, fleshy texture that's hard to forget. With a cradling of oak, it has a rich body met and balanced by crisp acidity, amid defined flavors of apple skin, melon and pineapple.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Peach, melon and vanilla cookie aromas are mild, simple and a touch mealy. The mouthfeel on this basic Albariño is fleshy and plump, with adequate acidity. Sweet apple and tropical fruit flavors are lasting and stay the course.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño
"Made with grapes cultivated with organic and biodynamic methods, this opens with aromas of pressed white flower, honey, toasted hazelnut and mature orchard fruit. The vibrant, linear palate doles out mature yellow apple, honeydew melon and white almond alongside bright acidity.",Italy-Piedmont:Cortese
"This very ripe, jammy blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Syrah smells rich and concentrated. In the mouth, however, it's syrupy and low in acidity, while flavors of cassis and blueberry push up against candied before finishing dense and extremely ripe. Drink now through 2019.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Red Blend
"Black cherry, clove and smoked meat aromas are rolled up into one wondrously savory scent in this 50-50 blend of Mourvèdre and Syrah. Flavors of beef roasted in blackberry and Sherry sauce sprinkled with oregano and marjoram entertain the complex palate.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"This comes out of the bottle with a little bit of funk, so give it a brief decanting prior to serving. Once the sweaty sock aroma blows off, it delivers modest cherry fruit and a peppery spice component that's reminiscent of nasturtium blossoms, a supple, round texture and a mouthwatering finish.",New Zealand-Central Otago:Pinot Noir
"One of the first Super Tuscan wines, this iconic blend of 80% Sangiovese, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc opens with aromas of scorched earth, underbrush, ripe plum and a whiff of blue iris. The palate offers dried black cherry, prune, mocha, licorice and clove. Assertive but refined tannins provide the framework. Drink 2016–2021.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Oaky and dense, this wine is sourced from the Nunes Vineyard, a fine site in the heart of the appellation. Raspberry and blueberry jam sway between a juicy midpalate, integrated with the oak and yet toasty, before boasting a vanilla-cherry finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Violet, rose, cherry, baking spice, Alpine herb and mineral are some of the aromas and flavors you'll find on this radiant Nebbiolo. Bright acidity and silky tannins balance the juicy palate. It's elegant and boasts great depth, but will continue to evolve for years. Drink through 2030.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"This gorgeously crafted, full-bodied Tempranillo is a modern beauty. Marzipan, wood grain, baking spice and black-fruit aromas make for a spectacular bouquet, while a ripped, strapping palate is raring to go. Flavors of blackened toast, fine wood, black plum and blackberry finish with gusto and notes of licorice, baking spices and cracked black peppercorn linger on the finish. Hold until 2017, then drink through 2026.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Tropical fruit aromas are suggestive of bath soap and body oil. This feels obtuse, with depth and an oily sensation to the palate. Chunky, ripe, oily flavors of melon and orange finish loud and ripe, with a deeper set of tropical fruit flavors than your average Argentine Torrontés.",Argentina-Other:Torrontés
"Borra demonstrates its mastery with whites in this interesting, perfect mélange of sweetness and zip. Made in a dry style, the sweetness is mostly in the aromatics, which imply peach-colored roses, and inviting mouthfeel, which imparts subtle grapefruit and stone fruit amidst all the crispness.",US-California:Gewürztraminer
"There's a distinctive herbal accent that gives this wine background notes of forest floor, bramble, tight berries and mint. They pair well with the delicate cherry-driven tones of Tuscany's native Sangiovese and make for a complex, layered wine. It has a raw, nervous quality that will relax with a few more years in the bottle.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"An attractive, lightly structured cru wine that has juicy cherry fruits. It is balanced, ripe with acidity and gentle tannins in equal measure. Drink from late 2017.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Michael David's new Cabernet Sauvignon brand has the winery's signature toasted oak and coconut-kissed tannins. But it's interestingly tamed, bearing bursts of black cherry and blackberry that effortlessly hit your palate in between quiet gusts of vanilla spice.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"The second wine of Château Meyney comes from one of the top estates of the appellation. From selected parcels and barrels of wine, this shows the same sense of structure as the top wine, while the fruitiness is developing more quickly. The black currant and plum-juice flavors are already bursting from the tannins. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Coffee, toast, nut, forest floor and fleshy plum aromas waft out of the glass. The big, round palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry jam, licorice and chopped herb alongside ripe, loosely knit tannins. It's straightforward for a Brunello but it has a juicy, immediate appeal. Drink now through 2020.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"92-94 A rich and firm wine, packed with dark tannins, wood flavors, very concentrated and dense. The sweet, smoky character comes through to give opulent black fruits.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Light, fresh, soft and already very drinkable. The initial taste is dominated by citrus, and then it rounds out, adding toast, green fruits and a definite sophistication for a simple white Burgundy.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Gorgeously aromatic with notes of white blossoms and waxy lime and lemon skins, this dry, delicately composed Riesling is a stunner. Tart mango and and tangerine flavors are juicy on the palate, accented with lemon verbena and a lingering waxiness. It finishes remarkably long with a streak of lemon acidity and a zesty astringency. Delicious now for its youth and exuberance, but likely to develop well over through 2021–2024.",US-New York:Riesling
"So enormously delicious, it will be hard to keep from drinking this gorgeous Cabernet right away, and that's just fine. It's composed of the most intensly concentrated flavors of blueberries and blackberries—dense, pure and slightly heady with a liqueur-like alcohol. The tannins are classic Diamond Mountain, firm and minerally, while oak plays the perfect role of the buttered toast and sweetly charred supporting character. Despite its immediate attraction, it's best cellared for 6–8 years, at the very least. Fans of old Cabernets will still be loving it in 2029.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dry, acidic and harsh, this wine's cherry-skin flavors have a tannic bitterness. It tastes like an old-style Chianti, without the charm.",US-California:Sangiovese
"This is mild and lightly citric smelling, with an ocean spray note on the bouquet. On the palate, it is fresh and deep, with a note of nectarine. The finish is solid, but loses some fruit and gains some bitterness.",Chile-Curicó Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Already the structure is beginning to make way for ripe plum and damson fruits. With its firm structure, this is a complex and concentrated wine that will need to age over at least four years.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine consists of all five red Bordeaux varieties plus 5% Syrah. Tart, soft and juicy with black and red cherry fruit, it's direct in its delivery of dried herb and licorice—flavors that complement the robust ripeness and density.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"From a vineyard site at the southern end of Oakville, where it touches Yountville, this is a gloriously dusty, smooth and age-worthy wine, bright in crisp red cherry and cranberry while offering deeper, darker elements of licorice and toffee. Concentrated, it's substantial and yet balanced, with something to say on the long finish.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Superripe, almost sweet, this has good acidity and firm, fuzzy tannins that help balance the jammy cherry, raspberry and cola flavors. Good with a slightly sweet barbecue sauce on ribs and chicken.",US-California:Zinfandel

"Aromas of minty oak, pastry and jammy raspberry set up a palate that's racy, juicy and somewhat raw feeling, with plum and raspberry flavors. It's woody on the finish, with a spice flavor.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tinto Fino
"The wine's label sports a black and white image of a city skyline, and the wine inside the bottle might make for a decent glass pour at an urban bistro. There's a lot of vanilla flavor and some pleasant black cherry fruit.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"To call this Cabernet huge is an understatement. The tannins are hard and dramatic. As for the fruit, you can hardly find strong enough descriptors. It shows blackberry jam and black currants, cassis liqueur and minerals raised to fabulous mountain concentration. Violets and oak add to the equation. Somehow it all balances out, resulting in a wine of unusual grace and power. But it needs age. Drink 2019–2031, if not beyond.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A blend of Olsen Vineyard in the Yakima Valley and Clifton Hill on the Wahluke Slope, the aromas are generous, with notes of dark plum, smoke and baking spice. The palate is weighty and full, with palate-coating purple-fruit flavors that show pleasing depth, density and length.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Brisk in acids, with lush, long hangtime lemon, kiwi, tangerine and vanilla flavors. It's all upfront in this drily delicious Chardonnay.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Pepper, acidity and tannins are the stars of this young, unresolved Syrah. Under all that is a solid core of blackberries and blueberries that have a slight baked quality, like fruit in a pie. The wine needs time to knit together. A blend mainly of Morgan's cool Double L Vineyard and the fine Paraiso Vineyard, at the warmer, opposite end of the appellation, it should hit its stride in mid-2009.",US-California:Syrah
"This Pinot shows basic varietal character, displaying ripe, opulent raspberry and cherry pie flavors, with a touch of toasty oak. It's soft enough to drink now.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Sugary flavors of orange and apricot jam mark this simple wine. It's oaky and creamy, with good acidity.",US-California:Chardonnay
"In terms of price, this wine can be considered the entry-level wine for the increasing range of Douro wines form this famed Port estate. This wine is all about fruit—bright red fruits—and just a touch of spice and toast from the wood aging. Drink the wine from early 2018.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"This winery always manages to pack in rich fruit and hearty spice. This bottling shows bay leaf, anise, pine needle and black tea aromas that accent a core of plum. That hearty dark fruit carries through to the palate as well, but warms up with earthy soil, licorice and minty fudge flavors. A luscious, lingering mouthful.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A rustic Chardonnay, with a sweet-and-sour orange sauce flavor and a creamy texture.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Fine, soft and round, this is a simple Pinot Blanc that's fruity and creamy. Apples and pears dominate the fruit flavors, with a texture that is open and ready to drink.",France-Alsace:Pinot Blanc

"Quiet on the nose, this wine speaks louder on the palate, where it delivers melon, pear and citrus flavors. It's balanced and clean, a light, refreshing white to serve as an apéritif or alongside mild fish dishes.",Germany-Franken:Silvaner
"Very sweet in white sugared orange and vanilla flavors, like a honey-nut candy bar. Will satisfy Chard lovers with a sweet tooth",US-California:Chardonnay
"Extra sweetness and density give this wine a full and generous personality. Dry Proseccos usually show a little extra peach juice and nectarine, as this wine does, without being heavy or cloying.",Italy-Veneto:Glera
"The 2010 Select is a step ahead of Torii Mor's single vineyard offerings, but holds to the common thread of hard, tart, tight wines with little flesh on their bones. Here the raspberry and strawberry fruit pokes through the herbs and tannins enough to warrant drinking sooner while waiting for the others to (possibly) soften up.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Crisp, steely and linear with grapefruit and pineapple flavors, this is a refreshing Pinot Gris from one of Lake County's newer sub-appellations. It's an interesting contrast to the winery's upfront and fruity Pinot Grigio. On the finish there's a hint of tree nuts.",US-California:Pinot Gris
"This attractive, fruity wine has refreshing acidity and clean lemon and orange zest flavors. It has a creamy side as well, giving a smooth, soft aftertaste that balances with the fresh acidity. Drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Easy, fresh and approachable, this screw cap Sicilian red opens with raspberry, cherry and toasted almond aromas. There's a touch of bitterness on the finish.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nero d'Avola
"This is a great project dedicated to and featuring the winery's workers, who are named on the bottles, although the wine itself is a tad sweet. Baked black cherry, licorice and caramel aromas lead to a palate ripe with purple berry and cocoa dust flavors. An easy to quaff and light-bodied red.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lychee and tropical fruit aromas are heavy and rubbery. Ditto the palate, which weighs in soft. Generic tropical flavors of lychee and papaya are mellow at best and finish with bitterness.",Argentina-Other:Torrontés
"The fresh, peardrop-scented nose of this bottling is appetizing. Similarly clean flavors brighten its dry and easy-drinking palate: green pear, lemon flesh and zest. A friendly, light summer wine.",Austria-Niederösterreich:Grüner Veltliner
"This 100% varietal wine sees a hearty dose of new oak and is built for the long term. It leans classic in its elegant layers of dried herb, red currant and pomegranate flavor. Boldly structured, it pleases rather than challenges the palate.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Struck flint and crushed mineral tones reverberate through this bristling Kabinett. While zesty and linear in style, it boasts revitalizing sweet-tart grapefruit and lime flavors. Drink now through 2021.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"A standout in Melrose's well-made, affordable lineup, this captures attractive scents and flavors of English breakfast tea with lemon highlights, and a streak of honey. Residual sugar is 18 g/L.",US-Oregon:Riesling
"Aromas of raspberry jam are a bit stretched out and unusual for a Rioja. In the mouth, this is fresh and fruity, but a bit light on substance. Savory red-fruit flavors end comfortably, with a good texture.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"Full-bodied and embued with tannins supple to the point of creaminess, this dark-fruited Shiraz offers flavors of leather, cola, espresso and bits of black olive and tar. Ready to drink.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
A bitter green element to this otherwise medium-sized wine detracts from any of its fruit.,US-California:Pinot Noir
"The dark garnet color seems right for a wine that smells like black cherries and black-skinned plums, and tastes deep and rich. Both the flavors and the texture seem shaped by subtly spicy oak. Fine-grained tannins add a velvety touch and the finish lingers.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"From a 25-acre site on the western flank of Rutherford, this wine includes 2% Malbec. With sanguine cassis, cranberry and cinnamon touches, it's a soft, round and velvety expression of the hearty variety, finishing with notes of coffee and dark chocolate.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"96-98 Barrel sample. A powerful wine, packed with tannins from structured Cabernet fruits. It exudes muscularity, intensity and concentration. The wood element is present. Maybe the final freshness is missing.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Light wood-aging has given this wine some rich structure while keeping its natural fruity character. Black currant fruitiness dominates the attractive juicy nature of the wine with its smooth texture and final acidity. Drink from 2016.,France-Southwest France:Malbec
"Dark, meaty and mellow on the nose, with blackberry and a distant hint of tomato leaf. It's a fraction candied and scratchy in the mouth, but the mildly herbal plum and cherry flavors are solid. Sweet and slightly smoky on the finish, with fading substance the longer it goes.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"The Comté Tolosan PDI covers vines throughout the southwest wine region. This Malbec is a ripe, structured wine that is rich with ripe black fruit flavors. It has an edge of minerality as well as juicy berry fruits and generous tannins. The wine is ready to drink.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"Typical varietal aromas of black-skinned berry, blue flower a spice note waft out of the glass. The straightforward, easygoing palate conveys mature black cherry, raspberry jam and a light note of ground pepper alongside soft, round tannins. Simple but well made, it makes an ideal quaffing wine.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nero d'Avola
Floral hints of acacia blossom play with ripe pear notes on the nose. The palate offers pleasant spritz and a real twist of that white pepper desired in Grüner Veltliner—ideal for summer days and immediate drinking.,Austria-Niederösterreich:Grüner Veltliner
"This mouthfilling red features lashings of oak, but the bountiful blackberry and blueberry fruit still shines, framed by notes of maple syrup and vanilla. The finish delivers a powerful finale of tannin, but the bold fruit powers through. Drink now–2015.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
"Toast, dried sage, menthol and a whiff of coconut lead the nose. The raw, extracted palate offers roasted coffee bean, espresso, anise, coconut and hints of dried berry but it lacks fruit richness. Burly, astringent tannins give it a bitter, mouth-puckering finish.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Leather, spice, tobacco and tea emerge from the nose of this Sicilian blend of Nero d'Avola, Syrah, Merlot, Cabernet and Petit Verdot. You'll get aromas of clove, allspice and vanilla behind vibrant blueberry and raspberry.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Red Blend
"This medium-bodied Barossa blend displays supple tannins and a silky finish, making it immediately accessible. Hints of smoke and sweat and complexity to the currant aromas and flavors.",Australia-South Australia:Red Blend
"This plump-textured blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier features aromas and flavors of apricot, melon, mango and ginger. Drink it over the next nine months for its appealing, forward fruit nature.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style White Blend
"The fruit sources—Klipsun and Gamache—are excellently displayed in this white that includes 8% Sémillon. A bracing, cool blast of citrus, white peach, melon and cucumber is buoyed with crisp minerality. The wine spent seven months in 15% new French oak.",US-Washington:Sauvignon Blanc
"A wonderfully savory touch of fragrant wild thyme precedes the tangerine peel notes on the nose of this promising and aromatically scented wine. The palate comes through with tangy zesty tangerine and bright fresh lemon. This is streamlined and taut, muscular but svelte. This just fills palate and mind with its fizzing, vibrant citrus notes that shine on the absolutely dry concentrated palate. Lots of refreshment and excitement here. Drink 2017–2030.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"Red cherries, sagebrush and dried violets show on the nose of this clonal selection. The medium-bodied palate offers even-keeled flavors of red cherry, cranberry and cracked pepper, providing lots of flavorful action on a relatively light frame.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"At more than four years of age, this Syrah is very dry. It's also tannic, with a hard, astringent bite to the blackberries. Somewhat rustic, it seems unlikely to develop in the bottle.",US-California:Syrah
"Candied berry aromas are clean and pleasant. This is solid on the palate, with a bit of reduction. Jammy plum, cassis and spice flavors finish slightly raw in feel, with an oaky shading.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Malbec
"Almost too much of a good thing, Passo is a thick, jammy and modern blend of traditional Italian grapes and international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. This is a bold, big wine with a thick, chewy mouthfeel that should be paired with aged cheese or succulent meat.",Italy-Veneto:Red Blend
"Not a cookie-cutter wine, this tastes very alive and exuberant. It offers an aroma like fresh-baked scones, with very tangy flavors like orange and pineapple. That also makes it lively in texture, with lots of bright acidity derived from the grapes. Slightly nutty nuances develop on the finish, which is exceptionally long. It's a rare wine that has no added sulfites.",US-California:Chardonnay
"From a selection of vineyard sites and clones, this wine offers juicy acidity behind a wave of plummy red and black cherry, an earthy foundation keeping things real. Oak and tannins are well integrated, and plenty of clove flavor make for a spicy finish. This gets extra attention for the awesome label.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This tiny-production wine shows an attention to detail in the vineyard and cellar. The clonal selection shines, given partial barrel-fermentation, partial stainless steel, all aged in mostly neutral French oak. Honeysuckle aromas jump from the glass, followed by viscous, juicy tropical elements of mango and lychee. It finishes dry and lemony.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Floral aromas of wisteria and lychee are tropical and musky. In the mouth, this unoaked Chardonnay feels oily but also citrusy. Flavors of lychee and lime finish similarly, conveying tropical overtones.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Chardonnay
"Lively, enticing, this wine offers aromas and flavors of apples and pears and a smack of spice. The wine's elegant balance of fruit, sugar and acid gives it a food pairing advantage—partner it with everything from fresh grilled seafood to spicy ethnic cuisine. A lingering spicy finish seals the deal.",US-New York:Riesling
"While intensely ripe on the nose, this beautifully balanced Bordeaux-style blend offsets luscious fruit with dazzling acidity and a rigid frame of fine tannins. Black plum, cherry and currant flavors are succulent but pristine, penetrating deeply through a long finish. Drinks well now but should improve through 2021.",US-New York:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A six-grape Rhône blend, this does not lose focus or intensity. It strikes the palate head-on with flavors of dried leaf, prune, cooked cherry, cinnamon and mocha. But despite the raisin/prune flavors, it does not seem overripe or in any way over the hill. Rather, these superripe flavors have somehow been tamed, the alcohol is just over 14%, and the wine leaves a sinuous, sensuous trail of flavor as it moves through the palate.",US-Washington:Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is a small, family-run estate situated in the heart of the appellation, with a bent for making elegantly styled wines. Here, in its fourth vintage, small amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc are blended in to provide a concentration of high-toned raspberry, cherry and cassis atop soft layers of integrated tannin and oak. The wine remains rich and velvety through a long finish.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A real success, this 100% Merlot, sourced from the Stillwater Creek and Conner Lee vineyards, is exotically scented with a rich mix of baking spices, coffee, dust, pencil lead and cedar. Lots of oak influence, but it plays well against the tart and mellow berry flavors. There is a suggestion of dried leaf, perhaps an indication of older vines.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Toasted hazelnut, golden apple and citrus scents lift out of the glass. The linear, elegant palate delivers ripe pear, lemon zest, bread crust and mineral alongside a refined perlage. It finishes crisp and dry.",Italy-Lombardy:Sparkling Blend
"Just slightly off-dry, this excellent bottle mixes its ripe lemon, orange and papaya fruit with breakfast tea-like flavors. Its acidity is ample enough to keep the sweetness at bay, making it a fine, all-purpose wine that should please a wide variety of palates.",US-Oregon:Riesling
"Engaging aromas of red rose, iris, wild berry, cinnamon and a balsamic note waft out of the glass while juicy cherry, white pepper, anise and chopped mint drive the spicy, polished palate. Firm but refined tannins provide structure. Drink 2017–2021.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"This wine needs some time to open up after pouring to fully express itself. With time, rich notes of black currant, brambly berry and black cherry grace the nose and mouth, with a touch of licorice root and espesso unfolding after swallow.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon:Rhône-style Red Blend
"A sweet toffee flavor dominates this wine. It is soft, round and smooth. Dried prune and sultana add to the wine's richness. The aftertaste is soft and fruity.",Portugal-Port:Port
"This impressive wine combines power and style. It has a classic Bordeaux-like aroma that's subtly spicy, very clean, complex and precise. Then loads of red and black fruit flavors come out, seeming almost sweet for a moment until those firm tannins and lively acidity kick in to add a textural grip. The finish lingers, with light spicy oak notes that fade slowly. Best now through 2020.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a ripe, rounded and firmly tannic wine. It has weight and a dense texture, with a black plum flavor. With its fruits, sweet tannins and solid structure, it's likely to age well over several years.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The nose of this Russian River Valley, single-vineyard offering shows positive dark berry fruit bearing mild meaty accents.  Made in a lighter style, the flavors follow the aromatic opening and the wine finishes dry with medium tannins, red berry and tea notes.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Clean and crisp apricot, nectarine and green-melon aromas are typical for the variety. The solid, fresh palate is crystal clear, while flavors of peach and nectarine finish as smooth as glass.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño
"Coming from 11 different vineyards, Doug Margerum's blend of 43% Grenache, 41% Syrah, 9% Mourvèdre, 4% Counoise and 3% Cinsault offers squeezed olallieberries and dried oregano on the nose. The palate shows lots of boysenberry jam, leveled by pine-sap and herbal elements as well.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"From two blocks of a vineyard above Freestone that's strongly influenced by the ocean, this wine is marked by leathery pepper, baked cherry and an exotic mix of savory spice. Medium-bodied, it has a density that's both plush and lush.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"The Lorna Marie is the winery's reserve, and it has exceptional concentration and depth. Berry and cherry dominate, spiced up with a pumpkin pie accent. Round, rich and full, yet moderate in alcohol, this is a fine expression of Oregon Pinot Noir in a challenging vintage.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This bottling from Kick-on Ranch is fresh and easy on the nose, with lemon-lime soda, crisp Asian pear and sweet jicama aromas, making for a refreshing experience that almost everyone can enjoy. It's light in body and acid-powered on the palate, with Pink Lady apple hints.",US-California:Riesling
"Sarmassa is among Barolo's top vineyard crus with south-facing slopes and white, relatively unfertile soils that help restrict yields. You can taste the evident mineral vein in this Barolo that appears as a dusty afterthought to the wine's aromas of black fruit, pepper and licorice. It's a ripe wine with firm tannins that need to unwind: drink after 2018.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Sweaty, austere and tannic, this wine has more depth and mass than the other reds from Goose Ridge, but still falls away quickly, leaving residual flavors of leaf, chalky acids and an unpleasant sweatiness.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made with 70% Sangiovese, 15% Syrah and 15% Merlot, this opens with aromas of black currant, freshly cut grass and a whiff of thyme. The easygoing palates doles out juicy black cherry, clove and a hint of smoke set against smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"From nose to palate, smoke and dusty mineral notes extend a savory, regal tone to this dry, full-bodied Riesling. It's richly textured, almost oily, on the palate, but refreshed by spine-tingling streaks of pineapple, lemon and tangerine flavors. The finish is long and penetrating. Drink now through 2020.",Germany-Rheinhessen:Riesling
"A bit light in aromas, this appellation blend slowly shows dried cranberry, slight raspberry, juniper and wet earth. The clean but simple flavors surround iron, more dried cranberry and a pinch of dried herbs.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is an herbal, low-alcohol style. Tart wild berry, lemony citrus, fresh herbs and a streak of iron combine gracefully. This is a new trend in Oregon, emphasizing non-intervention, subtle detail, low alcohol and neutral oak, and here it's been done well.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"The deep, almost tawny gold color, coupled with a slight pétillance, signals that this is no ordinary GV. It went through four days of whole cluster maceration before being fermented with wild yeasts in new 500-liter Austrian oak puncheons. It's rich, toasty and lively in the mouth, yet smoothed out with the oxidative impact of the time in wood. A generous and flavorful wine, it shows toast and nuts and caramelized highlights along with light apple-butter fruit.",US-Oregon:Grüner Veltliner
"Eclisse (a terrific blend of Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Friulano) offers creamy density and luscious aromas of mature fruit, yellow flower and honey. It would make a perfect pairing to lobster tail with butter.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:White Blend
"An average, everyday Cabernet, okay for the price. It's soft and a little sweet, with sugared blackberry tea flavors.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"The perfumed scent of ripe, red-cheeked Mirabelle plums is joined by some lovely bitter notes of fir honey. The palate shows the typical 2014 freshness, adding passion fruit, pear peel, honeycomb and grapefruit pith to this aromatic tableau. In between, seams of pepper and honeysuckle are highlighted by bright, zesty acidity. The wine offers an irresistible contradiction of structure and enthusiasm.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"Nice fruit flavors show yellow fruits, stone fruits, some melon and hints of apricot. The wine is 100% varietal, 13.5% alcohol, and sourced from the Upland vineyard on Snipes Mountain. Overall good balance and length.",US-Washington:Viognier
"The notes of ash, cherry, and plum are faint and soft in feel but it's well priced for the quality and delivers enough tannic heft to live up to its name.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A wine that succeeds in combining great depth of flavor and structure with an impressive array of flavors. On top of the tannins is juicy black fruit, cocoa, a welter of spice and ripeness. The acidity and new wood put the wine into a more modern style. Wait for at least 5–7 years.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"With judicious wood aging, this is a rich wine. Red berry and red-currant fruits dominate the acidity, giving a wine that is ripe and juicy. The aftertaste brings in attractive red cherries and acidity. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"This is a tough, chewy Merlot, a bit of a stylistic departure for Walla Walla Vintners. Perhaps it's the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, or perhaps just the result of the challenging 2010 vintage in the Walla Walla Valley. But the greenish tannins bring a lot of herbal flavors to the forefront, and tend to bury the fruit.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Reedy weedy aromas include notes of motor oil and leafy berry fruits. This tastes as weedy as it smells, with underripe herbal berry flavors that never shed an overriding green essence.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe, with jammy red fruits, this is an attractively fruity wine. It has maraschino cherry flavors, intertwined with acidity to give structure, a fresh character and soft tannins. Drink this year.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"This is Buena Vista's basic Carneros Pinot, but it's certainly a wine worth investigating. Dry and tart in acidity, it has flavors of cranberries, sour-cherry candy, oak, and earthier notes of rhubarb and heirloom tomatoes that give it savoriness. Drink now until 2015–2016.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Laced with baked apples, ginger and savory spices, there's something unique about the nose on this off-dry Riesling. On the palate, honeyed apples and pears combine with a tart lemon-lime acidity and a hint of bitterness on the finish.",US-New York:Riesling
"A very subdued nose suggests some dried orange peel but the palate is full of life: there is bracing, bright and lemon-scented acidity on the dry palate and drenched stone. There is concentration and a texture of the finest, purest citrus oil. This is wonderfully mature and ready now but has the stuffing to last. Drink 2016–2020.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"There's a very appealing sense of hickory smoke to this wine, which comes from a block planted in 1973 on this historic vineyard. Red cherry, mulberry, sweet sage and cola also play into the nose. Rich sandalwood flavors show on the palate, as does cedar, thyme, smoke and tart berry elements.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A big wine, but some persistent sulphur and earthiness on the nose results in aromas of leather, scrambled eggs and tobacco. Rugged on the palate, but that's to be expected for a big-boned Malbec like this. Flavors of blackberry and black cherry are supported by powerful oak, leather and an infusion of herbs. Drinkable now and best through 2010.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"88-90 Barrel sample. An intensely spicy wine, full of exotic flavors, dried prunes, figs and a powerful layer of cinammon. The wine certainly has character.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Along with a slightly oxidative character, this perfumed wine has a ripe yellow fruit and spice edge. It is already delicious to drink.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"With dry tannins, this 100% Gamay also has plenty of fruit that will give acidity and red-cherry flavors. For the next few months, it needs to soften and round out. Drink from 2016.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Toast, roasted coffee bean and anisette aromas lift from the glass. The tense palate offers dried cherry, toasted oak, star anise and a hint of white pepper alongside bracing tannins.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"The Réserve Personnelle line from Bott Frères decidedly greater intensity than the Tradition range. This Riesling exhibits great fruitiness allied with a very mineral structure and tight acidity. The wine has a future, so drink now and until 2019.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"A blend of 60% Sémillon and 40% Sauvignon Blanc, this is barrel-fermented, with the Sémillon component being put through malolactic fermentation. The result is a medium-bodied white with a smoky, buttery bouquet and flavors of peach, passion fruit and grapefruit. Drink now.",US-California:Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc
"The wine is dominated by crisp, herbal flavors. With acidity, citrus notes and just a touch of spice, it's fruity and bright. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Seductive aromas of raspberries, sandalwood, graphite and a pinch of allspice entertain the nose on this wine. The spiced wood character carries to the palate, where dried strawberries and pomegranate add riper fruit elements.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is a gamy wine that shows ripe fruit with a barnyard accent. It's quite full and forward with red berry flavors, bright acidity and a sense of structure.",France-Provence:Rhône-style Red Blend
"This rustic wine is overripe in prunes and raisins, and hot in alcohol. It's also as sweet as a minor Port.",US-California:Syrah
"Dark, rubbery aromas are offset by a floral berry component. Grabby tannins are a big part of this Cabernet's chunky palate. Flavors of hickory, café mocha and roasted berry fruits finish chocolaty and with residual tannins.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"High-toned and already considerably far down the aging path, this 98% pure Merlot (2% Cabernet Sauvignon) brings the heat (14.9% alcohol) and packs substantial, earthy tannins. The fruit flavors remain on the lighter side of strawberry and raspberry, with a strong herbal component running through the middle and into the finish.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Dark and delicious, this wine pulls everything together for a flavorful, even graceful character that's not at all oaky. It smells like dark berries, has hints of violet and tastes like crushed blackberries and dark chocolate. The texture is richly—rather than stiffly—tannic, and the finish lingers nicely.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"Ballentine consistently makes one of the best Chenins in California, and while this 2009 seems rushed to market, it's a good alternative to Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio. Shows bright, zesty acidity framing citrus, green bean and wildflower flavors, and the finish is totally dry.",US-California:Chenin Blanc
"Here's one of the most ageworthy wines of the vintage. A 100% Cabernet, its grapes come from a vineyard in eastern St. Helena, off the Silverado Trail. Cab's usual blackberries and cassis are there, along with classic elements of green olives and herbs, with a funkiness that adds an umami tang. Very finely constructed, very complex, spicy and delicious. Give it six years, at least.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Pear and vanilla aromas are what you'd call basic, and there's a briney note as well. Feels about medium, with mild acidity and a dilute quality to the palate feel. Tastes of lime and green banana, with brine and fresh bell pepper thrown in.",Chile-Central Valley:Chardonnay
"Bright cherry aromas and flavors.  Light and easy to drink, with a bit of green stemminess on the finish that adds character.",US-New York:Red Blend
"This well-priced effort is loaded with flavors, in a forward, fruit-powered style. Streaks of root beer, cola, earth and citrus create a nicely layered mouthfeel, but it's the ripe, sweet fruit that really shines here. It's perfect for drinking now through 2020.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This block selection is supple, almost silky, and coats the palate with lip-licking cherry-fruit goodness. Streaks of hazelnut and nougat extend the finish. This delicious wine spent 15 months in 50% new French oak.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"An aromatic and fruity wine with bright lemon and apple flavors. Light and fresh, it needs to let its fruitiness calm down. Wait until the end of 2014.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese White
"A delicious blend of 55% Cabernet Franc, 27% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Sauvignon and a dash of Petit Verdot opens with aromas of concentrated black plum, blackberry, blue flowers and a whiff of leather. The juicy palate doles out fleshy black cherries, crushed raspberries, white pepper, clove and grilled herb while velvety tannins provide the framework. A licorice note marks the close.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Ripe black cherry and a hint of menthol in both the aromas and the flavors give this brawny wine a unique personality. It has bold fruit, ample tannins for texture and good acidity for balance. This is tasty now but will age well through at least 2023.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Youthful and bright, this shows the lean, bright side of the Famiglia Zingarelli line. You can really taste those Sangiovese characteristics thanks to lively tones of wild berry, raspberry, blue flower, wild mushroom and subtle spice. That zesty acidity makes the wine perfect for cheesy pasta or lasagna.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"An impressively rich, firmly tannic and dark wine. It shows less of the Cabernet Franc perfume than of its strong structure and black currant fruits. There is an austere line of minerality that shows the wine's youth. Keep this wine for 4–5 years.",France-Loire Valley:Cabernet Franc
"From Montemaggiore Vineyard on the western hills of the appellation, and containing 5% Viognier, this is a well-made wine, nicely rustic in a dirty, rowdy mix of black pepper and earth. Dense, thick layers of cocoa play with floral notes of lavender and rose, finishing softly. This will age well through 2023.",US-California:Syrah
"Delicate scents of red berry, blue flower, forest floor and menthol lead the nose. The no-frills palate offers juicy wild cherry, star anise and cured meat framed in firm acidity and close-grained tannins.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"For the price, you get a fair deal with this dry, clean wine. It has flavors of cherries and oak and spice, and goes down nice and easy.",US-California:Cabernet Franc
"It's keen in acidity and somewhat overripe, with the taste of prune macaroons. It's also pretty tannic. Doesn't seem likely to develop with age.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This opens with subdued aromas that suggest chamomile flower, passion fruit and a whiff of adhesive bandage. The lean, stringy palate shows notes of crunchy celery, grapefruit and a hint of stone alongside nervous acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon
Vines planted in 1947 are the source of this dark and concentrated wine. It has a strongly smoky character with dry tannins. They contrast with the potential of the red cherry and berry fruits that are ripe and juicy. The wine is developing well and should be ready to drink from 2019.,France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Rich and opulent, showing masses of honeydew melon, orange crème, vanilla and spicy flavors. Really seductive, so easy to like. A touch of oak adds just the right note of smoke. Great with roast pork.",US-California:Grenache Blanc
"Beaver Creek makes a variation of Fairytale every vintage and this one, sourced from Napa Valley, is 41% Merlot, 36% Zinfandel and 23% Syrah, a mix that seems to work very nicely here. The wine's Zin almost tastes as if it has mountain tannins; the wine is overall herbal and earthy, ripe and sturdy with balanced fruit.",US-California:Red Blend
"This is a big, bold and dry wine that will pair well with roast lamb chops or grilled steaks. Spice rack aromas and generous blackberry, boysenberry and black-cherry flavors ride a velvety texture of fine-grained tannins. It has good concentration, layers of flavor and a lip-smacking texture.",US-California:Red Blend
"The aromas provide notes of baking spice, vanilla, licorice and dark fruit that are starting to show some bottle age. Full-bodied dried red-fruit and cranberry flavors lead to a tart finish.",US-Washington:Syrah
"96-98 Barrel sample. A wine that shows intense spice, with ginger and grated nutmeg. This lies over the top of the ripest yellow fruits, added to mango, sweet pears and a fresh, final character. Complex wine with an immense future.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Dense aromas of berries come with graphite and peppery scents, with notes of wood smoke and grilled meat. This feels full and a touch rough and rugged, with raspberry and plum flavors matched by herbal and burnt accents. It's forward and toasted on the finish, with coffee, herb and animal notes.

"There's a dusky walnut edge on the deep color, and aromas are lightly floral and strawberry-like with a slight smoky note. However, the flavors are quite savory, smoky, earthy and meaty, building a wild taste profile. These accompany a medium body and firm texture with light tannins and acidity.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend

"This is a serious Toro wine with smooth, dark, leathery aromas along with hints of wintergreen, licorice and berry pastry. It feels rich and layered, with complex flavors of licorice gum drop, nutmeg, chocolate and blackberry. Almost decadent but not over the top or too tannic.

"Heavy and tannic, with baked cherry-berry flavors and a sharp finish.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Girardet's Bush Vine series explores recent plantings of Spanish and Italian varieties.

"Mer Soleil Chards seem to get bigger, riper and oakier every year. Of course, this is the winery's style, and when it works, the results can be fabulously rich, but this caramelized wine seems a little top-heavy.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Ripe, loamy blackberry, prune and cassis aromas lead to a structured palate that boasts big, firm tannins. This offers dark, ripe flavors of wild berry, black plum and chocolate prior to a toasty finish that's largely subtle and smooth. Drink through 2021.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec

"Creamy notes hover over red apple on the beautifully dry palate. The body is rounded and almost rich, with a touch of bitterness creeping into the autolytic, bready background. This is rounded enough for food and will be very versatile, especially with roast or grilled salmon dishes.",France-Alsace:Sparkling Blend

"A pure startling cherry note rises from the glass. It is flanked by notes of autumn forest, tar and dried orange rind. Evidently, there is some development and evolution here. The palate is alive and fills not only the mouth but all the senses with its alluring aromas, yet it is firmly anchored in earthier tones. The body is svelte and fresh: its fine-boned structure is as much down to fresh acidity as it is to finely flexed tannins. This is profound, lasting and delicious but also deliciously light.",France-Alsace:Pinot Noir
"Aromatic and richly fruity, this has surprising weight that gives the palate a round and smooth quality. The acidity is there, although it is covered by the superrich fruit.",France-Southwest France:Bordeaux-style White Blend

"Allegrini's base Valpolicella blend stands out in a crowd thanks to its richer, darker and extracted overall appearance. It shows medium length and density with fresh fruit flavors and a touch of savory barbecue spice on the close.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Made from fruit selected across this southern Burgundy appellation, this wine has a touch of minerality and more attractive white fruit. It's rich, soft, full-bodied and fruity. Drink now.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This winery is at the extreme edge of the pick-early, low-alcohol movement, which can make the wines challenging for the usual California Pinot fan. But this Pinot begins on familar territory, with heady aromas of dried violet and scarlet rose, damp forest floor, and cinnamon-laced cranberry sauce, managing to be both brisk and funky. The flavors are light and tart, but will pick up more savory characteristics from 2018–2024.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A blend of Loin de l'Oeil and Sauvignon Blanc has produced a ripe and soft but balanced wine from a vineyard owned by the Wine Museum of Paris. It has refreshing melon and white-plum fruits, and an aromatic character that is rich and full bodied. Drink now.",France-Southwest France:White Blend

"Scott Paul's largest production Pinot Noir is a nicely balanced, silky wine, fermented with wild yeasts and structured for elegance. Raspberry, black cherry, a touch of blood orange and a lick of molasses all contribute.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Black as night, with chunky, sweet, candied aromas as well as notes of bacon, shoe polish and cough medicine. This is a classic modern-styled wine with intense roasted berry, herb and exotic spice flavors. Licorine, prune, coffee and oak emerge on the broad finish. Very ripe yet it does a good job of straddling the line between big and overripe.",Spain-Central Spain:Red Blend
"Bread, vanilla cookie and pear scents drive the bouquet on this nature Cava. A citrusy, medium-bodied palate shows flavors of cider, brined apple and mixed citrus fruits, while the finish is salty, with notes of orange and grapefruit.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"It's been a while since Torres Chile has made a Chardonnay this good. Minerally and toasty is the best way to describe this structured white. Good acidity keeps it upright, while plenty of barrel, cinnamon, apple and lemon character give it a Burgundian leaning. This is woody, racy and very lively now. Drink in 2014–15.",Chile-Limarí Valley:Chardonnay
"A bit austere, this is an undeniably crisp offering. Delicate herbal notes accent underripe pineapple and white grapefruit, then end on a dry, stony note.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"With its 50% Sémillon, this ripe wine has the potential to be rich. It has a perfumed, fruity character at this stage, emphasizing flowery fruits along with citrus. As it develops, it will fill out comfortably. Drink from 2016.",France-Southwest France:Bordeaux-style White Blend

"Ripe plum and berry aromas are wrapped in a bed of creamy, spicy, cheesy oak and related vanilla and tobacco scents. This is full and generous on the palate, but also a touch acidic. Plum, boysenberry and cherry flavors finish with spice, toast and blackened notes. Drink through 2021.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec

"Roasted, leathery and rubbery berry aromas are gritty and short on brightness. This feels rugged but good. Jammy cassis and cherry flavors show notes of cocoa and herbs.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Camigliano's Brunellos are always distinctive thanks to the estate's positioning on the lower slopes of the Montalcino denomination in a location prized for grape-growing since ancient times. The beautiful 2007 riserva shows dark chocolate, bright cherry and leather. The oak influences still need time to settle down.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Brilliant. That crisp, tart Edna Valley acidity provides the perfect counterpoint to the orange, peach, apricot, honeysuckle flower and mineral flavors. This unoaked Riesling is a joy to drink. The winemaker suggests Mexican dishes, but it's super-versatile.",US-California:Riesling
"A late-harvest wine from 40-year-old vines, this is balanced with a totally refreshing touch of acidity and lemon curd. It is light and fruity, just hinting at honey and apricots. The aftertaste has a great lift of acidity.",France-Southwest France:White Blend
Zisola is a Nero d'Avola that is aged 10 months in oak for soft sophistication and creamy aromas of red fruit and spice. The wine is evolved and layered and shows great depth and personality.,Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nero d'Avola

"Those who buy this wine because it has a cool label will not be disappointed by the fresh 'n' clean aromas of lemon rind, chalk, nectarine, pink peach and lemonade. The tight and bright palate is also a plus, with a limestone character cutting the ripe apple fruit, proving even-keeled and easy to drink.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Umani Ronchi makes some of the best Verdicchio you will find in the United States today. There's a sweet candied quality to the bouquet that is followed by ripe fruit and pineapple. In the mouth, the wine is smooth and silky.",Italy-Central Italy:Verdicchio
"This wine has strong burnt-toast flavors, giving a hard edge and tough tannins. Less extraction might have helped. With some months, the buttered toast taste will give way to a more fruity character. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"It opens with aromas of beeswax, acacia flower and lightly toasted oak. The smooth, structured palate offers lemon drop, white peach, papaya and a subtle note of vanilla and spice.",Italy-Lombardy:Turbiana

The petillance is faint on this Cava. Aromas of sweat and bread introduce flavors of pink grapefruit and tart apple. An abrasive mouthfeel delivers generic citrus flavors.,Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"Mid-gold in color. Quite a broad bouquet - ripe stone fruit honey, white flowers and a strong stony mineral focus. Sweet, smooth, rich texture yet crisp, refreshing and brimming with lively flavors. Very long, persistent with complex layers that linger on the finish.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"This is the winery's best Nebula in years. While it's still a little on the soft, sweet side, the cool vintage has resonated in the wine's flavor, giving it a good structure housing cherry, currant and sandalwood flavors. Drink now.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lightly structured, this is a balanced, ripe wine. It has profited from the good vintage to offer strawberry, raspberry and citrus flavors that are well balanced and textured. Drink this attractive wine now.",France-Bordeaux:Rosé
"Cool herbal aromas of blackberry and cola are minty. This feels narrow, with hard tannins that aren't ready to reconcile now. Herbal salty flavors of meaty berry fruits are warm, spicy and steadfast with herbal notes through the finish. Drink through 2020.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Red Blend
"Strong raisin and prune flavors give this wine a late-harvest character, while fruit acidity and tannin makes the texture grippy.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fairly shy aromas of blackberry juice, uncracked peppercorns and dried lilacs show on the nose of this bottling by Ryan Render.

Cracked pepper also arises, making this a Syrah that will please many palates.",US-California:Syrah
"With the faux leather label and over-the-top carrying case, this Amarone emphasizes its packaging.

The finish is long and silky.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"

"Barrel aromas are out front on this 100% varietal wine, with notes of wood spice, vanilla, pencil lead and baking spice followed by dark plum. The flavors are dense, dark and palate coating. The wood shows quite prominently on the palate as well but if you can get beyond it, there are good things happening.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Aromas of pineapple, ripe melon and lemon create a balanced bouquet, while the citrus and banana on the palate make for a ripe and ready offering. The finish is long, clean and fresh, and the mouthfeel is good and lean, and overall quite crisp. Standard fare, but a good example of Chardonnay.",Chile-Curicó Valley:Chardonnay

"A touch of French oak brings a honeyed, vanilla smokiness to this wine, but the star really is the fruit. It's rich and forward with pineapples, peaches and mangoes, and made brilliant by crisp acidity. This is a good price for a Chardonnnay of this quality.",US-California:Chardonnay
"A smooth, creamy wine that is Burgundian in style, with its judicious use of wood and great structure. The fruits—lemon, yellow and green plum—are beautifully balanced with the tension of the minerality. This wine will develop more complexity with age; drink from 2015.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese White
"Hard, stringy tannins give a tough astringency to this 100% Cabernet. Partly they're from grape skins and partly from 100% new oak barrels. There's a huge core of black currants, however, and the finish is dry and balanced. Will it age? Almost certainly. Give it at least eight years in a good cellar, and it could go well beyond that.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Clove and beef jerky aromas are odd and forceful. A globular palate lacks form and balance, while this tastes oddly and singularly of clove.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This white invites you in with floral, citrus and tame tropical aromas and flavors; otherwise it's soft, mid weight and integrated in oak. Made from Mendocino Wine Company's estate La Ribera vineyard, the grapes show off elevated minerality on the finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Joe Barton, who's made Grey Wolf wines since 1994, launched this brand inspired by pop songs in 2011. This Counting Crows ode delivers aromas of raspberry-laced black tea, clove and cardamom. It's soft and inviting on the palate, with anise, mocha and blackberry flavors that finish with a wash of tobacco. It was still quite tight after hours of being opened, perhaps due to the 35% whole cluster maceration. Drink 2017–2023.",US-California:Grenache
"This wine is a blend of Merlot (28%), Cabernet Franc (26%), Petit Verdot (21%), Cabernet Sauvignon (15%) and Tempranillo. Aromas of red fruit, herbs, pencil eraser and tobacco are followed by full-feeling red and black fruit flavors backed by grainy tannins.",US-Washington:Red Blend

"A huge improvement over prior vintages. Opens with powerful blackberry and balsamic aromas along with char. Feels comfortable, with toasty, oaky blackberry flavors accented by spice and pepper. Toasted and chocolaty on the finish. A full-bodied, smoky bruiser; only 290 cases made.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Tempranillo
"This is a ripe wine, packing tannins as well as black fruits into a rich package. Black cherries and black plums are paired with a core of dry tannins. The acidity comes right through to give the wine its potential. The wine comes from a very stony vineyard and this shows in its tight mineral aftertaste. Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Granted, this is a young wine, but on first impression it imparts a raw, burly earthiness that's hard to completely embrace, with a sense of cooked mushrooms and sour cherry around soft, light-bodied tannins. Give it plenty of air.",US-California:Grenache
"Tropical in personality, with a leanness of pineapple and guava, this wine holds a concentration of oak-influenced flavor and texture at its heart. It ends generously sultry in sweet Tahitian vanilla.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Not many varietal Marsannes are made in California, and this one is impressive. Savory, earthy nuances—rather than fruity ones—dominate, giving it a distinctive flavor profile. It starts with dried herb and mineral aromas, brings in fennel bulb and white pepper flavors and wraps it all with a luscious texture that powers a long, lingering finish.",US-California:Marsanne
"This barrel selection evokes the AVA's black-cherry fruit character nicely, keeping it lively and balanced, with excellent depth. Tasting the wine is like gazing into a deep pool; the flavors keep pushing further into the finish. Streaks of coffee and milk chocolate are in the mix, but it's the excellent fruit that captures your attention and holds it.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This lightly sweet wine has an intense oaky, peppery, smoky aroma and the flavors come out the same way. The beefy, liquid-smoke character should match ribs in barbecue sauce.",US-California:Red Blend
"This is a fun, flavorful blend of 63% Merlot, 14% Syrah, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Petit Verdot and 4% Malbec. Soft, juicy red fruit meets sizable tannin and leathery oak laced in vanilla.",US-California:Red Blend
"Good complex flavors, and nicely dry, with intricately layered black cherry tart, red licorice, cherry liqueur, milk chocolate, pepper and sandalwood flavors that finish long and spicy. Feels a bit too soft for aging, but nice now.",US-California:Syrah
"Dark berry, mint, menthol and a balsamic note are just some of the aromas you'll get on this gorgeous wine. The full-bodied palate delivers ripe black cherry, clove, ground pepper and anise alongside firm, refined tannins. Give it time to fully develop. Drink 2019–2026.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Williams  Selyem's track record with this bottling is excellent. While this 2012 has notes of raisins, they're more of a seasoning than the main ingredient. It's a robust, lusty wine, filled with blackberries, dark chocolate, anise and pepper, yet balanced. It will age through 2024.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Put this one in the cellar for a good six years, at the very least. Right now, it's tight and tannic, with dramatically layered blackberry, currant, dark chocolate, mint and cedar flavors.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Seeming delicate at first, barely-there whiffs of lemon peel and green herb turn riper and sunnier on this dry, medium-bodied Riesling. The palate is quite unctuous, dripping with white peach and grapefruit nectar. A cool strike of steel extends from midpalate to finish, lending mineral elegance to this ripe, rich wine.",US-New York:Riesling
"The lyra system of training vines is designed to give the fruit maximum exposure. With that and the vines' placement on the steep Heiligenstein hill, it's no surprise that this wine is ripe and rich. Perfumed, intense and generous, this will age for many years.",Austria-Kamptal:Riesling
"This lightly built wine is fully expressive, with floral aromas and bright layers of black cherry, peppery clove and toasted oak. Balanced and unhindered, it will work well at the table.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is the winery's estate-grown Cabernet Sauvignon, and it opens rather stiff and herbal. It's a taut, dark and deep wine that rewards decanting, showing good concentration and dense layers of brambly berries, licorice and espresso. Age for at least another decade.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Hickory is the lead aroma, followed by notes of leather, earthy berry and spice. It feels juicy, lively and traditional, with a fine body-to-acid ratio. This offers classic Rioja flavors of red fruit, tomato, tobacco, dill and vanilla, with a long, consistent finish. It's healthy and drinkable now through 2017.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"Tapiz's best wine to date, and the first one to shoot higher than the basic or reserve level. Aromas of fresh balsam wood, ripe blackberry and cola are clean and deep. Feels just right, with rich, rewarding flavors of molten berry, chocolate and coffee. Finishes warm, toasty and with focus. Has it all; drink now through 2015.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Red Blend
"Really dark, vibrant purple in color, with oak-inflected notes of cedar, vanilla and chocolate layered over black cherries. It's on the soft, slightly sweet side, but offers an easy-to-drink mouthful of sparkling Shiraz.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
"Loads of black fruit intensity is backed by soft notes of chocolate, leather and spice. The wine boasts a very plump and round style that makes it a pleasure to savor.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Purely varietal, this is a soft and peppery wine, with tastes of berry and chocolate. Despite the relatively high alcohol, it feels light and simple, without depth or complexity.",US-Washington:Sangiovese
"This is a rich wine, just beginning to mature. With berry fruits, some firm tannins and acidity, the wine is ripe, still showing some stalkiness and with a dry firm aftertaste. Drink starting from 2018.",France-Provence:Provence red blend
"Richer and more austere than the regular brut, and bone dry, it has a steely elegance. The aromas are delicate but suggest citrus fruits and a touch of strawberry. It’s very well balanced, with crisp acidity. There’s just the slightest hint of fruit on the finish, and then it turns dry and austere again.",US-California:Champagne Blend
"This forward, full-bodied Rosso opens with aromas that recall resin, mature black plums, incense and spearmint. The one-dimensional palate delivers black cherry and vanilla alongside velvety tannins. It closes on a sugary-sweet note.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"A lovely rosé, dry and crisp, with peach skin, orange, strawberry and white pepper flavors, highlighted by brisk acidity. Would score higher if not for a certain heaviness.",US-California:Mourvèdre
"Made from Petite Sirah, Tempranillo and Tannat, this beautiy illustrates the type of blended red wine that is putting Paso Robles on the map. It's filled with cherry pie, cola and mushroom flavors that combine rich fruit with a subtle earthiness. Don't bother to age this wine, just drink it now with mushroom risotto or a rich lamb ragout.",US-California:Red Blend
"Though this is pure Cabernet from an excellent Walla Walla vineyard, the flavors seem rather harsh and quite astringent. The dark fruit is cloaked in bitter, chalky tannins that require some rich food to cut through.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This blend of 80% Grenache, 10% Roussanne and 10% Clairette is medium-bodied and silky in texture. The nose features hints of crushed stone, underripe pear and melon, then fills out with slightly riper notes on the palate. Drink now.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style White Blend
"Concentrated in black currant, cedar and olive, this has subdued tannins that are chalky and smooth. The aroma takes on pretty lavender and violet connotations that allure. Dried herb and black pepper mingle on the finish. This wine is lovely now, but should cellar nicely through 2020.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Hailing from the winery's In the Rocks Vineyard, this wine opens with aromas of nori, black olive and blackberry that evolve into herb and plum. The dark fruit flavors are sweet and concentrated, lightly tacky in feel, backed by velvety-soft tannins.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Loads of pineapple jam and roasted peach flavors in this rich, oaky Chardonnay. Nothing shy about its fruity power, with rich vanilla and caramel oak barrel influences. Could use greater complexity and nuance.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Sweet cherry and raspberry flavors, with soft tannins. The acidity melds into the ripe fruits, in a wine that is rounded and ready to drink.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Comprised of Viognier, Marsanne and Roussanne, this is an exuberantly fruity wine. It has powerful, ripe flavors of tropical fruits, citrus, peaches, oak and vanilla. Like ambrosia in the glass, it's honeyed and opulent.",US-California:Rhône-style White Blend
"While soft on entry with slightly pulpy, sweet plum flavors, this Cab Franc gains intensity on the midpalate as spicy bramble notes and soft tannins accumulate. Approachable in style, it's a pleasant everyday red with just a hint of leafy green on the finish.",US-New York:Cabernet Franc
"Lots of rich, ripe varietal flavor in this dry, tannic young Cabernet. It's strong in blackberries and cassis, with a cedary edge that has the scent of a cigar box. Firm enough to develop some bottle complexity over the next 6 years or so.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A bit too pungent and sweaty to score higher, with pronounced and aggressive nettley aromas and flavors. It's round in the mouth, finishing herbal and green. Some will no doubt praise it for these same qualities.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"The Two Vines Chardonnay is simple, clean and reliable. Suggestions of green apple and white peach appear on the palate.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"Tart and fruity, this Riesling bears flavors of apple and white peach, with an extra dimension of citrus rind. Balanced and lively, the fruit rules the day.",US-Oregon:Riesling
Dried peach and apple flavors peek out timidly through layers of crushed minerals and spice on this earthy semisweet Riesling. It's delicate and spry in mouthfeel with a brisk lemon-tea note that brightens the finish.,US-New York:Riesling
"A soft, light-footed entry is followed by extracted, yet still finely-knit tannins—presently, black cherry fruit is hidden behind them, but a juicy acidity promises they will come to the surface before long.",Austria-Burgenland:St. Laurent
"Fosco comes in beautiful packaging complete with a big red wax seal on the front of the bottle. The wine shows rich concentration and aromas of red fruit and a touch of natural rubber or tar. In the mouth, it shows tart, crisp and simple characteristics.",Italy-Piedmont:Dolcetto
"What would convince a producer to call a wine Jovly seems to be a mystery. That said, the wine is fresh, rounded with plenty of orange juice acidity, honey and a soft finish. Screwcap.",France-Loire Valley:Chenin Blanc
"As a Corton-Charlemagne should be, this is big and opulent. The minerality is quite present, a fresh addition to a wine that has more to do with ripe, racy tropical and yellow fruits that fill the mouth. It is not a wine for aging, maybe 2–3 years, but is certainly delicious now.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Light and clear in color, this wine veers into cool-climate, restrained territory in its well-defined lines of sage, dried herb and stemmy earth. Dry tannins give an oomph of power beneath traces of dried rose.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Shea, as always, is a full-bodied, fruit-driven Pinot with a broad midpalate showing blackberry fruit and citrusy acids. It falls away rather quickly, leaving a stony impression, but is missing the concentration of Shea bottlings from other vintners.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Smooth-textured Port, with sweet red fruits under the brown sugar, nut and spirit flavors. This is certainly on the sweet side, with a velvet feel to it.",Portugal-Port:Port
"This powerful rich wine is finely structured and concentrated. It has weight from solid tannins that contrast with the high tones of the ripe red-cherry fruits. From a single parcel, this cru wine is dense, both firm and fresh. Drink from late 2017.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"This has a noticeable scent of tackroom leather that carries into the flavors, somewhat muting the black-cherry fruit. For such a young wine it is already on the way to drying out. Some interesting accents of pipe tobacco, smoke and coffee run through the finish. It's now at its best, so drink up.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Broad berry/cherry fruit flavors open up quickly, with lighter accents of compost and leather. This is a smooth, somewhat loose-knit wine, with pretty baking spices decorating the finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"An attractive blend that includes 20% Cabernet Franc, this is a soft perfumed wine. It has spice and toast from the wood aging which will integrate better in the coming months. The black fruits and acidity are already well in place. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Named on whim after a peacock's feathers and hence a fan, this attractive wine is full of bright fruit and the proper stony mineral structure typical of the Dão. The wood aging has given the wine extra richness without losing the fruit. Drink this finely wrought wine from 2019.",Portugal-Dão:Portuguese Red
"Tomero is a new line from the Carlos Pulenta group, and this one sings the tale of Salta with sincerity. You get telling acacia and lychee aromas, but none of the cheap perfume that can sometimes ruin the variety. The palate is lightly oily but linear, while the papaya, citrus and melon flavors just roll along.",Argentina-Other:Torrontés
"Brooding aromas of herbs, dark cherries and flowers are followed by supple, polished dark-fruit flavors. It's a promising wine from this young growing region.",US-Washington:Cabernet Franc
"Touches of yellow apple and sponge cake entice on the nose. The palate adds ripe, friendly and appetizing notes of yellow plum and lemon alongside creamy fizz set against a softly autolytic background. This presents a lovely union of fruit, freshness and development. Full of flavor, is has a dry, lemony finish.",France-Alsace:Sparkling Blend
"Full, textured nose mixes cherries and herbs, very clean and complex. The vines are almost 80 years old, and yield a briary, wild berry quality to the fruit. Balanced and complex wine, which unfolds in lingering layers through a long, satisfying finish.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This Chardonnay is made in a leaner, lower alcohol style. In place of the fat, rich fruit of some Chards you'll find a tart minerality, with the citrus and peach flavors containing hints of sweet green peas. Gains extra points for elegance.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Crushed minerals and steel reverberate amidst concentrated lime and lemon in this racy, laser-edged Riesling. Dry and taut on the palate, it finishes long with spine tingling acidity and revitalizing tangs of mineral intensity.",Germany-Rheinhessen:Riesling
"This winery has been making rosé for more than two decades, and nails the recipe especially well this vintage. The brilliant salmon-pink wine shows watermelon, light red cherry and a stony quality on the nose, while the grippy palate engages from the get-go with red plum, riverstone and gravel on the tip of the sip. Strawberry flavors carry through the strong acidity, and the finish is all about texture.",US-California:Rosé
"This brilliant wine is dry and tart in acidity, minerally, and supremely refined in Meyer lemons, pears, limes and tart apples. It's not one of those fat Chardonnays that melts in the mouth, but instead has firm texture and elegant complexity. It makes a beautiful accompaniment to grilled salmon, crab cakes, or a simple but glorious roasted chicken. Don't drink it too cold.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Approachable and harmonious, this Cabernet offers leather and barnyard notes on a restrained nose while plum and earth on the palate are surrounded by creamy-soft tannins. Surprisingly long finish. Try with roasted veal.",Australia-South Australia:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This has a balsamic nose of menthol, eucalyptus, new leather and chopped herb. On the palate, vibrant white pepper and licorice notes accent a core of Morello cherry and crushed raspberry fruit. It has a backbone of firm, polished tannins and bright acidity and will only improve over next decade.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"91-93 Ripe, soft fruit and tannins that come from fruit rather than wood. The acidity is a dominant factor, with great wafts of bright black currant fruits and final tannins.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is an outstanding Protagonist, 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Ciel du Cheval Syrah. As with other J. Bookwalter reds, it is loaded with an appealing toast scent, and is amply endowed with black cherry and cassis fruit. This is a luscious wine with terrific concentration and length, finishing with perfectly ripe tannins.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"From the vineyard on the slope above Château Pavie, this is a beautiful, juicy and ripe wine. It has a mineral character with great swathes of black-currant fruit. This is a very fine wine, well delineated, ripe and with a delicious red-currant aftertaste. Drink from 2026.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Somewhat hard-edged wine, showing the sharpness of young Chenin Blanc. It has a future, though, as this edge drops away, because there is some good weight as well as bright fresh final acidity. Keep for several months.",France-Loire Valley:Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay
"On the nose, high-toned pineapple and tropical fruit dominate Casa Larga's Gewürz. The palate is refreshing but simple with lots of apple juice flavors laced with a hint of wax and jasmine blossoms.",US-New York:Gewürztraminer
"There is some bitterness to this wine, with almond and quince flavors. Caramel and soft fruitiness lead to a more creamy character. Not for aging.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Super-spicy, offering a blast of white and black pepper, briary blackberry, black cherry sour candy, cola and coffee flavors wrapped into vigorous tannins. Retains the basically rustic nature of Barbera, but it's one of the better ones out there. Try as a smoother alternative to Zinfandel.",US-California:Barbera
"Lovely aromatics mix floral, fruit and barrel components in equal proportion. The wine has some solid tannins, and sits in the mouth with a bit of gravitas. Wild cherry, raspberry, fresh herb, and a little stiffness to the finish. Definitely a wine to age a few more years.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This is Blue Plate's first red wine after a couple successful vintages of Clarksburg Chenin Blanc. It's an impressive wine and one hell of a deal. Light in color with a pretty nose of flowery raspberry and strawberry, it's softly textured and delicious with a long finish, a wine to savor but not take too seriously, simply drink and enjoy.",US-California:Grenache
"Shy aromas of green banana, lime and lychee set up a pleasant, lifted palate. Flavors of lime, lychee, honeydew and mango precede a mild, refreshing finish. Drink now.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Torrontés
"Steely and perfumed, this wine sees only 20% new French oak, remaining vibrantly fresh. Baked apple and lemon pith veer into grapefruit on the palate, with spiciness to the finish that's both brash and loud.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This leads with light baking spice and apple pie aromas. The palate is broad, with abundant vanilla flavors that suggest strong oak influence.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"This hallmark Chianti Classico boasts a heady perfume of violet, underbrush, peach blossom and clove. The palate delivers bright red fruit, pepper and cinnamon with crushed cherry in the forefront. It's nicely balanced and should develop complexity over the next few years but is already delicious.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Sweetened with a concentration of juicy, ripe pineapple and tropical fruit on both the nose and palate, this is an uncomplicated and fruity off-dry Riesling. A tart, zingy acidity balances the sweetness on the finish.",US-New York:Riesling
"Crisp acids and finely ground tannins give this young Cab great structure, making it feel balanced and elegant. It's also a very ripe wine, showing lush blackberry, cassis and cherry flavors. The wine is big enough to easily support its significant amount of flashy new oak. Drink now through 2010.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made with 100% dried Zibibbo grapes, this elegant dessert wine offers intense aromas of ripe apricot, lemon jam and acacia honey. The fresh balanced palate doles out juicy layers of tangerine zest, candied fig and a touch of cinnamon.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Zibibbo
"A distinctly aromatic nose tells of honeysuckle while the dry, light palate is sherbety and less defined. Drink this easygoing wine soon, while aromas are fresh.",France-Alsace:Alsace white blend
"This is still closed but reveals restrained dark fruit and cocoa aromas. The palate is also closed down, showing only hints of blackberry and espresso, with massive tannins and evident alcohol. It lacks freshness and seems tired, although it could be in a mute phase. Hold and try after 2016.",Italy-Central Italy:Montepulciano
"This winery not only makes a bunch of single vineyard bottlings, but also tries to show off different styles. This one shows sweeter white peach, ripe cantaloupe, lush mango and a touch of vanilla on the nose. The palate is ripe and round with more mango, melon, papaya and banana flavors, yet that opulence is bound by chalky structure and lots of back-end acid.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Apricot and peach fruits dominate this creamy, soft wine. It's smooth, lightly toasty and ready to drink.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This light-bodied wine sings in bright, citrus-laden overtones, with enough length and complexity to intrigue. Rocky minerality overlays lemon pith and a delightful crispness that makes for a food friendly, celebratory selection.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Lots of ripe, sweet jammy cherry and raspberry fruit in this polished Pinot. Crisp acidity gives it a fortunate balance. It's for drinking now.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Made with a blend of Nerello Mascalese from different vineyard sites, or contrade, as well as various vintages, this special ""Vigna Alta"" Etna red shows elegant tones of small berry, black pepper and crushed stone. The wine represents the best of a natural, biodynamic and organic winemaking tradition that is taking hold in Sicily.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nerello Mascalese
"This mildly aromatic blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Vermentino marries apple and lime flavors into a fresh, citrusy white that persists nicely on the finish. Drink now.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style White Blend
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec is overtly woody smelling in support of chunky earthy berry aromas. A full, racy, balanced palate deals structured tannins and salty plum flavors backed by a heavy dose of wood spice. On the finish, this is dry, oaky and tannic. It's good now, but will be best from 2020–2025.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Violet and floral boysenberry aromas show earthiness and leather after airing. This feels supple and deep, with just enough acidic lift. Toasty, blackened cassis and blueberry flavors show a hint of bacon, while toast, spice and chocolate flavors grace a solid finish. Drink through 2024.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Black cherry, smoked beef jerky, burned caramel and a touch of maduro cigar show on the nose of this study of a popular Syrah clone. The palate is equally savory, with smoked meats, blackberry fruit, crushed black pepper, soy and a tarry edge, bolstered by sparkling acidity.",US-California:Syrah

"Dry, clean and tart, this has cherry, Dr. Pepper and vanilla flavors.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"While this Cab may be a touch soupy and heavy on the nose, aromas of coffee grounds and berry fruits are good. A full, blocky palate features cheek-rubbing tannins, while this tastes of coffee, chocolate and herbal berry fruits. For everyday purposes, this makes the grade.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's a sharp, brambly quality to this Brunello that recalls aromas of forest floor, chopped herb and wild berries. You'll also get mineral tones, slight graphite tones and the mouthfeel is both drying and polished. Pair this wine with Porcini risotto or pork medallions.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"There is juicy blackberry at the core of this Cab, 2% Petit Verdot blended in for concentration and color. Dusty, the accompanying flavor players include clove and herb.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Savory, baked aromas of raisin, leather and spice control the nose on this traditional Rioja GR. The palate shows lively acidity and flavors of savory spices, oak, rubber and baked berries that finish with pulse and layering. This isn't great but it's a very good, classic Tempranillo.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"A finely structured wine, well spiced with ripe berry fruits and intense but balanced acidity. This is stylish, attractive and is worth aging for 3-4 years.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"It's hard not to jump up and down about the outstanding value represented here, a wine made from Dutton Ranch fruit that's juicy and generous in baked strawberry, earth and rose petals. A grippy structure provides weight around nuanced, spicy cherry-pie flavor and plenty of body to satisfy.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is a small property under the same ownership as Château Paloumey. It is unusual in the 20% Petit Verdot that goes into the blend. That gives the wine its deep color and rich generous black-plum fruit. Solid and dense, the wine will age well. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"As with so many wines from Blaye, this is dominated by Merlot. That gives a ripe full wine that is spicy and full of black-plum fruits. Firm tannins still show through the fruits that are balanced by acidity. The wine still needs to age, so drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Classic varietal aromas of tomato leaf, hay and passion fruit lead the nose on this fragrant white. The elegantly structured palate offers grapefruit, white peach and mineral alongside crisp acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon

"White spring flower and yellow stone fruit aromas lead the nose. The lively, straightforward palate shows peach and a hint of bitter almond accompanied by brisk acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Grigio
"There is just a touch of peach amidst the green and yellow apple notes. The palate adds a stony earthy touch, as well as a hint of lanoline, and has an impressive core of fruit that radiates throughout this wine with pure apple flavor and crisp freshness. This strikes a high soprano note of absolute purity. The body is taut and bone-dry, the finish is clean and lasting. Gorgeous now but totally built to last. Drink now through 2035.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"In a firm style, this is a dense wine, its black fruits packed into a solid structure. It has power as well as ripe fruit, with tannins and acidity, and is likely to age for a couple of years.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
This spicy wine is fruity while also complex with its combination of red berries and a pepper edge. It is full and ripe with a light crisp aftertaste. Drink now.,France-Loire Valley:Rosé
"This is a plump, medium-bodied rosé at a reasonable price. Pomelo or grapefruit notes combine with stone fruit, then finish stony-dry and tart.",France-Rhône Valley:Rosé
"This full-bodied wine has a smooth texture that is mouthfilling and rich. It offers mild, savory mineral flavors that complement the creaminess and prolong the finish, while subtle oak flavors contribute to its sense of smoothness and viscosity.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"There are ripe notes here of blackberry preserves, blueberry tart, chocolate and black stone that accompany this wine over its long finish. The wine has jackhammer tannins and enormous structure that need a few more years in the bottle to soften up.",Italy-Southern Italy:Aglianico
"A bit roasted and reedy smelling, with a hint of stem and grass mixed with berry and leather. The palate is full and feels creamy, with mildly roasted black fruit and leathery flavors. Good on the finish as the wine picks up steam and clarity with airing.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tinto Fino

Persistent, bountiful acidity carries it to a black raspberry-inflected finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Light but inviting aromas of lemon juice, apple flesh, ripe nectarine and crushed white rocks show on the nose of this bottling from Malibu. Sea-salt flavor appears throughout the palate, where pear and nectarine flesh meet with vanilla-butter-on-toast flavors. Nicely textured it's quite mouthwatering.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This opens with aromas of acacia, toast and a whiff of honey. The linear palate offers golden apple, Mediterranean scrub and smoky hint of flint. A note of toasted hazelnut fills in the finish.",Italy-Southern Italy:Fiano
"The nose is flat and not very expressive. The flavors are of sweet fruit, but beyond that they are hard to describe. A midland wine with a simple, clean finish and a bit of a waxy mouthfeel.",Chile-Maule Valley:Chardonnay
"Right now this is a big, tough Cabernet. It's very dry and oaky, and the black and red cherry flavors have a jammy edge. Despite the apparent simplicity, you find yourself returning to it, a good sign that suggests complex ageability. Give it 4–6 years in a cool cellar.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"There is something of the summer meadow about this—the scent of yarrow combines with sun-ripened stone fruit. The lightness of touch is amazing: It tiptoes on the tongue but sprays with peppery freshness and lemon poise. What a lovely, balanced and light-footed joy. The long finish of yeasty spicy savor shows off the serious core of this wine.",Austria-Kamptal:Grüner Veltliner
"Pretty and deep, this has notes of juicy boysenberry, blueberry and cherry. The balanced acidity and racy tannins give it substance and style.",US-Washington:Malbec

The palate's dark fruit flavors are lifted by touches of cocoa and espresso, framed by tannins that are very chalky but not obtrusive.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A very good, delicious Chardonnay that's easy to drink, and whose richness suggests shrimp, scallops, lobster and similarly rich fare. Dry and crisp in acidity, it wows with pineapple marmalade, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla, honeysuckle and mineral flavors, brightened with zesty acidity.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This is the lightest in a series of wines featuring the Avesso grape. Herbal, crisp and with plenty of acidity, it's also fruity and ready to drink.",Portugal-Vinho Verde:Portuguese White

"Give this Cabernet a brief decanting. After that, the aromas and flavors match up in cherries, blackberries and cassis, with a savory coating of sweet oak. Drink now.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Dr. Crane vineyard has really rocked in recent vintages. Enormously rich and deep, with a fabulous compaction of black currant, dark chocolate, baking spice and cedar flavors. There's an interesting grilled meatiness, like the charred fat on a great steak, and lots of new oak, but it's perfectly integrated. The smoky, toasty barrel notes are perfect companions to the fruit's power. Drink this 100% Cab now and over the next 12–15 years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"The 2004 and 2005 vintages of this wine were priced at $15, which gives some idea how fast the supply of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has increased. Kono's 2008 is on the light side, but tart and zippy, with a refreshing aspect to its pineapple and grapefruit flavors and herbal overtones. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"The aromas are subdued, with notes of spice, mineral and black fruit. The palate is reserved in style, supported by a frame of firm somewhat gruff tannins.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This variety's signature dried- and fresh-herb aromas are on full display, with light barrel spices in the background. The palate brings lightly sweet plum and currant flavors that provide appeal.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A proprietary blend inspired by Chateauneuf-du-Pape, the Count's Red is more closed than the other offerings from Tasca, showing little on the nose beyond chocolate. In the mouth, raspberry fruit begins to emerge; the wine is obviously a big, full-bodied and tannic. It's meant to age, and we think it will do so just fine. Try in 2008, or pair it with hearty meat dishes if you can't hold out that long.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Red Blend
"This wine has offers aromas of dark plum and chocolate. It is inky garnet in the glass, with flavors of cherry, cranberry, cured meat, thyme and sage. Stealthy tannins appear as if from nowhere just before a bright finish that is punctuated by a touch of smoke.",Israel-Galilee:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Earthy aromas of fresh tarragon and burnt cedar make an intriguing start to this wine, whose soft opening on the palate veers quickly into heavy flavors of chopped oregano. A plum element emerges faintly on the midpalate, but this is a solid wine for herb lovers.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Though this is near the bottom end of the Rex Hill Pinot pole, it does not suffer from a lack of flavor. Big fruit, organically grown, runs right through the core, a mix of berries, cherries and plums; woven into the fruit is a lightly leafy vein, a whiff of tobacco, and a suggestion of earthy, organic compost. Thoroughly delicious.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Lovely and fresh, this versatile wine is bursting with melon, white peach and green pineapple fruit flavors. As before, the bright acidity and perfect balance mean that it will accompany mild cheeses, roasted fowl and lighter seafood dishes. Think of Pinot Blanc as the more elegant cousin to Pinot Gris, and you've got it pegged.",US-Oregon:Pinot Blanc
"A rich blend that includes the local Abouriou grape gives a structured, firm wine that has both tannins and juicy black fruits. The oak aging still shows in the spice and vanilla edge that underlies the fruitiness. It should be aged, so drink from 2016.",France-Southwest France:Red Blend
"Like the winery's other newly released Zinfandels, this one is excessively soft, missing some structure to provide balance to the extraordinarily rich berry, cherry, bacon, cola and spice flavors. Still, it earns points for sheer deliciousness.",US-California:Zinfandel
You'll find aromas of black locust flower and a whiff of beeswax on this. The beeswax note carries over to the straightforward palate together with pear and a hint of bitter nut alongside soft acidity.,Italy-Piedmont:Arneis
"This small-production wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percents of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Pencil lead, cedar and tobacco leaf greet on entry before soft yet generous layers of tannin swirl on the palate, informed by a depth of blackberry. A mix of savory and fruity, the finish is subtle in white pepper. Cellar through 2022.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Named after the poppy that blooms in May in the Alentejo, this wine is juicy and fruity, with a light touch of tannins. It is all red berries, with an easygoing juicy character, Drink now.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"Citrus and white-fruit aromas are elegant, smooth and suggestive of Burgundy, which makes sense given that this was aged in oak. The right amount of acidity lends lightness and length to the palate, while ripe lime and honeydew flavors are well oaked. A fresh friendly finish is minerally and crystal clean.",Spain-Northern Spain:Godello
"So intense and concentrated, this wine epitomizes the essence of Riesling. Steely, tight, very nervy and bone dry, it is packed with flavors of citrus, orange zest, grapefruit and green apple skins. The texture of this young wine is beautifully crisp. Drink from 2016.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"After opening with reedy, stalky aromas, this is raw and choppy on the palate. Flavors of herbal red plum and rhubarb conclude with tight, edgy acids and a bit of burn and heat. This is fresh and generally pretty good, but it lacks Toro's usual richness and power.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tinta de Toro
"This has a tropical- and grapy-scented nose, with notes of pineapple and melon at the fore. On the palate, this Viognier is voluptuous and intense, offering a peachy flavor and perky acidity that invigorate the palate.",US-Virginia:Viognier
"Aromas of green apple and Bartlett pear take center stage on this soft easygoing sparkler. The foaming off-dry palate mirrors the nose, offering white orchard fruit and a hint of citrus drop.",Italy-Veneto:Glera
"A solid, straightforward red that is immediately approachable and extremely drinkable. It's satiny in texture, with red fruit aromas and flavors of cherry, raspberry and rhubarb supported by hints of cocoa and eucalyptus. Mild tannins and a lighter weight followed by a clean, shorter finish make this easy-drinking wine an excellent choice for rich duck or heavily spiced lamb dishes.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon:Rhône-style Red Blend
"This soft wine is ripe and creamy. With fruit mainly from the southern Burgundy, it offers warm apricot and spice flavors. As a contrast, the zesty texture adds a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Here's a pleasant, easy to drink Grenache. It's dry and tannic and filled with cherry flavors, sweetened with toasty oak. Wisely avoids many of the pitfalls Grenache is subject to. Drink now.",US-California:Grenache
"Made mainly from Pinot Noir, this is a full wine, intensely fruity and ripe. Apple and sweet lime flavors give a rich feeling, while a touch of minerality adds the proper texture and balance. Drink now.",France-Champagne:Pinot Noir
"Aromas of orange blossom and pineapple juice are not substantial. In the mouth, this is chunky and plump, with oily peach and nectarine flavors mixed with some green bean. A heavy finish with little spine provides minimal cut and freshness.",Chile-Central Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Vibrant lemon- and lime-zest notes make this off-dry Riesling brisk and bright. Chalky minerality and a saline tone add depth, and there is a pleasantly bitter lemon-peel note that lingers on the finish.",US-New York:Riesling
"Loaded with ripe layers of bacon fat, smoked ham and ripe cherry fruit, this opulent Barolo would pair with pasta and white truffle or succulent pork medallions. It's a very distinctive and masculine wine that really does lavish on those Bresaola, tobacco and barbecue spice flavors.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Heavy butter, toast and caramel aromas and flavors give this wine a lot of impact, while the fruitiness is mild and the mouthfeel is soft.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This sweet, luscious Riesling shows an incredible array of fruit character, ranging from pineapple to kumquat and superripe melon. So intensely fruity, it manages to hide whatever minerality might lie underneath, so if rocks are your thing, let this one age a good long time; otherwise, it's delicious now.",Germany-Pfalz:Riesling
"Floral, fruity aromas, pistachio and peach flavors, and a frothy, sparkling texture create a sweet, fun and light wine.",US-California:Moscato
"Dense almost to the point of chewiness, this is a concentrated blend of Syrah, Carignan and Grenache. Earthy, plummy notes pick up hints of dark chocolate and licorice before ending rich and velvety.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Scents of violets and savory herbs add complexity to tart, juicy red cherries and plums on this crisp, elegantly framed Cabernet Franc. A touch of menthol highlights a cool, acidic edge on the palate. Finishes moderately long with a murmur of fine-grained tannins.",US-New York:Cabernet Franc
"A very awesome array of burnt bacon, dried violets, chipped asphalt and tart elderberry show on the nose of this bottling from a remote vineyard north of the Santa Maria Valley. A strong pepper spice starts the sip, followed by charred berries and black currants, tons of purple flowers and a persistent acidity.",US-California:Syrah
"The lime, pear and melon aromas and flavors are garnished with just a touch of vanilla. Picks up some vegetal lima bean notes on the palate, and the acids stick out a bit on the finish. Still, it's crisp and clean—and would go down easy after a hot round of golf.",Australia-Victoria:Chardonnay
"This Prosecco is not as fresh as others and offers a tiny hint of ash or matchstick at the back. In the mouth, however, the wine tastes tonic and tight and ends with a blast of citrus zest.",Italy-Veneto:Prosecco
"This robust wine has aromas of blackberry, plum, espresso and spice. The palate offers fleshy black cherry, raisin, roasted coffee bean and mocha notes alongside chewy tannins and soft acidity.",Italy-Veneto:Red Blend
"Good, deeply extracted flavors in this darkly soft wine, with blackberries, plums and spicy, chocolaty chai tea. It's nicely dry. The tannins are a little off, with some ragged, green edges that won't age away, so drink now.",US-California:Merlot
"Made from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, this wine is overripe. Although it's dry and the tannins are fine, it's dominated by raisiny flavors.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a soft, richly attractive red wine to drink now. It shows elaborate blackberry, cherry, currant, teriyaki beef, black pepper, anise and sandalwood flavors. An elegant mouthfeel, grows better as it breathes in the glass.",US-California:Syrah
"Girolamo Russo has crafted a gorgeous wine with impressive elegance and complexity. Aromas recall ripe fruit, dark vanilla bean, smoked bacon fat and a touch of cedar wood. The wine's texture is smooth and fine and it leaves a lasting impression of forest berry fruit on the finale.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nerello Mascalese
"This needs oxygen to open up past its slightly reductive nose; then it blossoms into a full-bodied, flavorful wine with a broad array of mixed black fruits. Hints of leaf and herb are nicely styled and not intrusive.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Named after the Swedish royal family, this estate produces accessible wines. In 2013, the style continues with a wine that is fruity and softly tannic, emphasizing ripe blackberry flavors rather than too much structure. It will be ready to drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine has structure and freshness although the fruit is on the lean side, offering black cherries and swathes of crisp acidity. The aftertaste is juicy, fresh and mineral.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"This blend of Merlot and Tempranillo, with touches of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon, opens with notes of warm cherry pie, black tobacco and cedar. Fresh boysenberry starts the palate, with mouthwatering spice in the midpalate and mocha on the finish.",US-California:Red Blend
"A white chocolate accent adds a touch of weight to the white cherry and watermelon aromas in the nose of this wine. The palate offers surprising weight, but it's countered by ample acidity and a citrus zest flavor that livens-up the finish.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon:Rosé
"A cuvée of Riesling, with a tiny splash of Moscato, this is on the sweet side of brut. Scents of wet paper carry into disjointed flavors of waxy lemon and simple sugar.",US-Oregon:Sparkling Blend
"Candied, slightly volatile red-berry aromas are topped with chocolaty oak. In the mouth, this is simple and medium-bodied. Salty berry and plum flavors are just ripe enough before this falls off on the finish.",Chile-Central Valley:Merlot
"This has an extraordinarily-high level of residual sugar, giving it a very sweet, honeyed taste. The flavors are of pure golden apricots, with accents of tangerines, buttered toast and vanilla cream. While it's not overly complex, it offers plenty of rich pleasure.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Roasted meat, charcoal, elderberry, asphalt and smoke show on the nose of this blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 42% Merlot and 12% Malbec. The smoke extends into the palate, where tangy plum and berry flavors mix with dark chocolate notes, soft texture and a lingering acidity.",US-California:Meritage
"Very ripe and forward in baked fruit or pie-filling flavors of cherries and raspberries, spiced with cinnamon, anise and nutmeg. The wine is a bit simple and is ready to drink now.",US-California:Syrah
"Shows more gooseberry and feline notes than previous vintages, but there's still enough sweet spearmint and pink grapefruit flavor to satisfy. The acidity is lovely and mouthwatering.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"This flinty Chardonnay shares a full oak expression with a whiff of petrol, suggesting a decant or cellaring until 2016 to fully soften. It offers sublime lemon curd and minerally peach flavor amid tangy acidity and a bright finish. It displays a ying-yang between polish and power.",US-California:Chardonnay
This wine is rich and gently textured with acidity under the red-berry fruits. Hints of fruit tannins balance the essentially juicy character of the wine. Drink from the end of 2015. Most of the Les Merrains grapes come from the Ferraud family estate in Vaux en Beaujolais.,France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Toasty, caramelized oak and sweet heat from high alcohol dominate this wine. The blackberry and cherry fruit flavors are very ripe. Drink now.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Banrock Station's 2006 Shiraz is a throwback to the kind of super value Australian wines used to provide with more regularity. For $5, consumers get a decently textured, supple wine with plenty of forward blueberry and plum fruit and touches of chocolate and pepper. Look for it by the glass or buy it by the case for entertaining on a budget.",Australia-Australia Other:Shiraz
"This starts with concentrated boysenberry and raspberry fruit, but in the mouth some off-flavors intrude. The fruit is close to raisined, and the finish carries a hint of plastic. Two bottles tasted, consistent results.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Smelling this wine is like sticking your nose into a jar of turmeric, with added aromas of ground coffee bean and broad black fruit that shade in the background. While the turmeric note remains dominant on the palate, the wine would pair well with spicy curry dishes—especially considering its modest 12% alcohol.",US-Virginia:Cabernet Franc
Earthy aromas of bay leaf and garrigue lift the dried boysenberry fruit on the nose of this bottling. Tangy elderberry fruit and underripe boysenberry show on the sip alongside oregano and savory spices.,US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is a fabulous wine from the greatest Champagne vintage so far this century. Still young, it blends almost equal amounts of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay fleshed out with Pinot Meunier. The minerality and the rich apple and green fruits are balanced, and acidity cuts into the wine with a pure, perfumed line of freshness. The wine could be drunk now, but it will age well into the the 2020s.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Aromas of tilled soil, dark berry, aromatic herb and a hint of coconut take shape in the glass. The simple palate offers juicy black cherry, espresso and a hint of dark spice accompanied by bright acidity and lithe tannins.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"If you're tired of Zinfandels that are unabalanced and inelegant, try this one. Yes, the alcohol is high, but it folds perfectly into everything else. The vineyard is in the Olivet Road part of the valley, which in many ways represents the ideal terroir of the Russian River. You'll find brisk acidity and firm tannins in this wine, but also ripely appealing blackberry, cherry, cola and briary wild chamomile flavors. This seriously good wine will age until 2022.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Green apple and lemon zest make for a pungent touch of volatility that tickles the nose as you sniff this ruby-colored Amarone. The intensity and clarity is great, and the finish concedes more room to spice, dark fruit and almond flavors.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This is a tightly textured wine that has plenty of green stone fruit as well as a bitter almond edge. It is taut, and the fruit has not completely surfaced yet. Age for three years.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"There's lots of espresso, roasted coffee bean and toasted wood on the nose that carry over to the palate along with black plum and vanilla. But there's not enough fruit richness to stand up to the astringent wood tannins.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Aromas of toasted oak, pressed yellow flower and ripe orchard fruit carry over to the palate along with toasted nut, yellow apple and a hint of vanilla. Enjoy soon to capture the remaining fruit and freshness.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Chardonnay
"Here's a sound, everyday-style Cabernet for drinking now. It's dry and tannic, with rich flavors of blackberries, black currants and plums, enhanced with sweet, smoky oak.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is rich and oaky in honey and graham cracker yet completely well integrated in terms of tannin and power. Silky smooth, it invites with compelling layers of apple, pear and fresh-squeezed blood orange, finishing roundly satisfying.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This new offering from Gamache Vintners is a Bordeaux-style blend made from 67% Cabernet Sauvignon, sourced from the Gamache and Champoux vineyards. Pretty cherry lollipop fruit carries a whiff of barnyard, and the tannins finish with an herbal echo.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Not particularly varietal for a Chenin Blanc, but a pleasantly rich white wine to drink now. It's crisp in acidity, with sweet flavors of oranges, honey and vanilla.",US-California:Chenin Blanc
"Aromatically alive with the smell of anise and salumi, this is a soft, layered expression of the grape. Blended with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah, Petit Verdot, Zinfandel and Syrah, it's expressive in blackberry and blueberry fruit.",US-California:Barbera
Here's a ripe and generous Tuscan blend with mature notes of black cherry and blackberry backed by thick extraction and extraordinary intensity. This is the kind of wine you'll need to pair with succulent cuts of beef thanks to the firm tannins and delicious richness it imparts in the mouth.,Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Lifted notes of rose water and honeysuckle blossom rise immediately from the glass. They remain just as perfumed on the palate, clothing peach fruit in floral fragrance. There is a pleasantly bitter edge and just enough freshness to stand up to the opulent flavors. This finishes medium sweet and has a perfumed finish.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
Citrus and match-stick aromas are basic. This feels plump and a bit low on energy. Generic flavors of melon with peppery green notes finish with low acidity.,Chile-Colchagua Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Chewy tannins make this Pinot Noir feel hard in the mouth. On the plus side is a dense core of raspberries and cherries, as well as a rich appliqué of smoky oak. Try aging it until 2017 to let it mellow.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"The fruit pops on this wine, with notes of blackberry and blueberry pie. It pulls no punches with a full-throttled style. It's a bit one-note but hits that note hard.",US-Washington:Syrah
"89-91 Smoky, firm tannins, with black currant fruits, firmly dark, dry and tannic, with a solid structure.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This medium-pink rosé is a blend of 40% Grenache, 40% Mourvèdre and 20% Cinsault. A silken texture easily carries restrained fruit shadings of strawberry and kiwi, along with plummier undertones, through a long finish. Ready to drink now, although it might still be a pleasant surprise come 2015.",France-Rhône Valley:Rosé
"This is a fresh-tasting wine with great balance that doesn't have oaky flavors or a thick texture. It has refreshing acidity, subtle apple and spice notes and a palate-cleansing texture. Fine enough and subtle enough to drink frequently.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This dry rosé sparkling blend would pair with easy appetizers or fried vegetable tempura. The wine is sharp and crisp, with a steely effervescent close. Bardolino Chiaretto is from the shores of Lake Garda in northern Italy.",Italy-Veneto:Sparkling Blend
"Simple, bright and packed with fresh berry intensity, this easygoing Rosso would pair well with meatloaf, lamp chops or pasta with meat sauce. The wine's naturally crisp acidity will cut through the fat content of these succulent foods.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"This is an interesting and very unique bottling of 50% Tocai Friuliano and 50% Arneis, showing Asian pear, gardenia, honeysuckle and a bit of citrus pith on the nose. The palate is rather oily, but that texture is cut by flavors of Meyer lemon peel.",US-California:White Blend
"Illogically, there are two second wines at this estate. This is the richer of the two (the other is Lions). It has intensity, spice, ripe apricot fruit and a smooth, dense texture. Its honey and botrytis notes are just right while the thread of acidity keeps it all in place. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Tart and acidic, this does not entirely disguise its green-bean scents with aging in French oak, 30% new. That sweet oak sticks out, but the tannins are chalky and the fruit hard to find.",US-Oregon:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Meaty, cuddly and kind is the best way to describe this big-boned, ultra ripe Toro. What makes it great is the price ($20 is a steal for this) and the complete lack of fierceness. It's easygoing but complex, with pulsing blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors. With modest but measurable tannins, it should age nicely for at least five years and maybe more, making it a bargain hunter's dream.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tinta de Toro
"Full of red fruit, light and bright at first, then denser in flavor with savory notes amidst Zin's cherry-berry deliciousness. Grown on the Talmage Bench east of Hopland in Mendocino County, where a number of great Zins are born.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This cuvée offers a mix of blue and purple fruits, with a forward grape-candy-character dominant. It's fruity and drinking nicely, but lacks the stuffing to improve much further with age.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Very much on the ripe, tropical side of Sauvignon Blanc, this is rich and concentrated. There are citrus and toast along with the spice and pineapple. Textured, it is still young and will age.",France-Bordeaux:Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine has spice, concentrated yellow fruits and a delicious backbone of acidity. With its acidity firmly in place, the wine is beginning to reveal the richer yellow fruit and tangy lemon. Already delicious, it will be better from 2017.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Aromas of ripe pears and peaches jump out of the glass, and the flavors follow suit, bouncing across the palate in a display of stone fruits. It's relatively full bodied, but a garnish of grapefruit zest on the finish keeps it balanced and lively. Best Buy.",Italy-Veneto:White Blend
"Almost a dessert wine, it's so rich in sugary flavors of pineapples, apricots, peaches and vanillas. Crisp acidity fortunately provides clean balance, but it's not really a dry table wine.",US-California:Viognier
"Bright and fresh, with streamlined and compact fruit, Poggio Teo has the natural acidity to stand up to cheese- or cream-based dishes. It has light dustings of toasted nut and spice that give the palate added dimension.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Ripe and juicy, this full-bodied wine has black plum and berry fruits that are well integrated into the juicy acidity and ripe tannins. The wine will develop quickly, so drink from late 2016.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Perfect apéritif Vinho Verde, light as a feather, attractively laced with citrus and peach flavors. It has a light prickle on the tongue, with a soft aftertaste.",Portugal-Vinho Verde:Portuguese White
"Lightly gold in color, it has a touch of botrytis to give a honeyed character. The wine is full and rich, with an element of dryness at its heart.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese White
"Purity and precision abound in this exceptionally light-footed sweet Riesling. It's buoyantly fruity, bolstered by waves of ripe white peach, pear and yellow-plum flavors. The finish feels edged by a fine filigree of lime acidity. Drink now through 2026 to capture its youthful exuberance.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"Leather, game, underbrush, dried herb and ripe black-skinned fruit aromas take shape in the glass. The big, chewy palate has a rustic charm, offering fleshy black cherry, game, truffle and a hint of cake spice wrapped in tightly packed tannins.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Boasting cherry-vanilla cola and ripe fruit notes, this is a young, fresh wine that shows hints of savory tones on the palate. Drink now.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This opens with oak-driven aromas of toast, espresso, coffee and coconut. The concentrated palate offers oak, dried blackberry, ripe plum, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and a confectionary note alongside packed tannins. The fruit is starting to dry out so drink soon.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"This opens with aromas suggesting toast, dark-skinned berry, smoke and a balsamic note. The firm palate delivers dried black cherry, licorice, sage and a hint of clove alongside assertive tannins. Drink after 2020.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Although this is the winery's reserve-level blend, it doesn't work well in this vintage. Vague and muted, the mix of grapes lacks focus, offering just a thin, generic red wine with a chalky aftertaste.",US-Oregon:Red Blend
"Shows all the hallmarks of the modern style of Chardonnay, with lots of ripe citrus and oak. The wine has too much oak, though, and is dominated by caramelized wood and sweet vanilla flavors that swamp the fruit.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This wine has too much extraction to allow the fruit to develop. It will soften out, although not enough. It is an 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon blend.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine's distinct and intriguing nose pairs cola and cinnamon with cranberry, chopped chaparral scrub and wildfire smoke. That scrubby character of green sage and mugwort extends to the palate, spicing up the beet juice, ripe raspberries and a pencil-lead backbone.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Young, tight and sharp-toned upon first sniff, this broadens out and opens up with an hour or two of airing. The pinpoint focus brings black raspberry, black cherry and light hints of tobacco into play. The 30% new oak seems just right, although there is some burn in the finish from the high alcohol.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a smooth, wood-aged wine that's full of berry fruits and rich tannins. The wine is dark and concentrated, with a medicinal hint and a juicy element to go with the powerful structure. This should age for 4–5 years and more. Screwcap.",Austria-Burgenland:Blaufränkisch
"Give this dynamic young Cabernet blend a good decanting or a little time in the cellar to mellow and let its edges round off. It's tannins are hard and astringent, masking the blackberries and black currants. Not one for the long haul, but 3–4 years should do the trick.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Foxy cherry and cough drop aromas are not convincing. Feels astringent and tastes tart, with sharp but candied cherry, faux oak and milk chocolate flavors. Blends sour notes with sweet oak, all to little avail.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"High-toned and citric on the nose, with foresty spice and a whiff of the ocean. Tight and nervy in the mouth, with herbal, spicy red plum flavors that are true to the variety. Honest but a touch lean and fiery on the finish.",Chile-Leyda Valley:Pinot Noir
"Sweet oak, berry fruit and clove aromas lead to a palate centered on racy acidity. Salty plum and red berry flavors conclude with drying tannins, feeling bold and fresh. Drink through 2022.",Spain-Northern Spain:Red Blend
"The Farm Winery takes a lighter, fresher approach to Paso Robles fruit, which works well in this bottling of 80% Grenache and 20% Syrah. Bramble, dried strawberry, star anise and cola aromas lead to a round and easygoing palate, with cooked cranberry, rose, slate and licorice flavors.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"White pepper, tart pomegranate and herbal touches show on the nose of this bottling from winemaker Mike Sinor. There's a strong spice-and-herb quality to the palate, evoking thyme, oregano and black pepper, which gives depth to the black plum skin flavors. It's racy with acidity and vibrant as can be.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A one-note wine. It's round and roasted, and it settles more toward savory than bright, fruity or lithe. The palate is on the thick side, with roasted black plum and other baked flavors. Fleshy, with a saucy, mildly herbal finish.",Chile-Central Valley:Carmenère
"Too sharp in acids, giving the cherry and raspberry flavors a real bite. Almost sour on the finish. Drink now.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"This old-vine Zinfandel with a dusting of Petite Sirah and Tannat in the blend is stewy, soft and fairly simple.",US-California:Zinfandel
Jammy aromas and flavors that are as rich as maple syrup give a sweet accent to this full-bodied and mouth-filling wine. It has a touch of tannin for grip and finishes on the sweet side.,US-California:Pinot Noir
"An aromatic wine, it has notes of tangerine and mineral. It drinks medium sweet (10 g/L residual sugar), with the sugar getting just a bit out in front of the acids.",US-Washington:Riesling
"Intensely fruity, almost tropical, on the nose and palate, this concentrated, juicy Gewürztraminer balances rich melon and lychee flavors with delicate notes of tea and spice. Just a hint off-dry in style.",US-New York:Gewürztraminer
"Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this opens with aromas of red cherry, underbrush and pomegranate. The palate is both concentrated and elegant, delivering raspberry, strawberry jam and notes of chopped mint. Velvety tannins provide support and finesse. Enjoy through 2021.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Nero
"This lively wine is fresh and bright on the nose, but not simple at all, with aromas of plump raspberry, pomegranate, rose petals, hibiscus and a hint of eucalyptus on the edge. It has tons of verve and pin-pricking acidity on the palate, where just-cut pomegranate, alpine strawberry and chopped thyme thrive.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Graphite and vanilla aromas are offset by herbal, stemmy notes of hard spice and mint. The palate shows tomatoey acidity and flavors of pie cherry, tart plum, cherry tomato and vanilla. As might be expected given the precedings, the finish is cleansing and high in acid.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Fresh strawberry and red-cheeked apple unite on the appetizing nose of this pretty pink fizz. The same, rich, rounded and fruity flavors play on the creamy palate. There is a bit of body here, pulled into focus by bright, lemony freshness.",France-Alsace:Sparkling Blend
"This wine sources from both Montecillo Vineyard in Sonoma County and Georges III in Napa, bringing together one barrel of each for an herbal, savory and edgy experience. Cedar, clove and a healthy dose of fresh herb make it compelling in a classical sense.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Another fine estate-grown Pinot Gris from Vista Hills, with plenty of green apple and Bosch pear fruit, along with some light cinnamon spice. There is also a suggestion of flower in both the nose and the mouth, but overall it's a bigger wine than that, with the fruit front and center.",US-Oregon:Pinot Gris
"Lemon and lime flavors cut through this wine that's crisp with a mineral character. It is packed with acidity, with a touch of wood that fits well into the fruit and texture. It's a beautiful wine, not fat although it will fill out. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Pear drop and some citrus are the aromatic markers of this soft, light and very easy-drinking wine. The finish refreshes with green pear flavors.",Austria-Niederösterreich:Grüner Veltliner
"This small domaine in the Mâcon region has produced a soft, ripe wine with attractive strawberry fruits. It's rounded, with just light acidity over the fruit flavors. At the end, it feels warm and ripe. Drink now.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Rich and concentrated, with well developed flavors of plums and blackberries and a spicy, peppery streak. Very dry, with stylish, ripe and fine tannins, and enough acidity for balance. This wine feels distinguished enough for the best tables.",US-California:Syrah
"Cherry and plum aromas carry the mildest touch of stem, yet the palate is reasonably stocky. Cherry and chocolate flavors may seem slightly confected, but given the wine's price it's hard to register many complaints. A creamy and flavorful finish makes this well worth the money.",Argentina-Other:Malbec
"This is a blend of the best barrels from the five Mercurey Premier Crus owned by the Devillard family. First produced in the 2010 vintage, the wine is now made in most vintages. It is a rich wine, bringing out the pure red fruitiness of a Mercurey and its beautifully integrated structure. It is concentrated and very dense, packed with vanilla, mint and dark coffee flavors as well as the fruit. Age this wine, at least until 2020.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Made of 80% Sangiovese, 10% Colorino and 10% Canaiolo, this opens with violet and redcurrant aromas. The straightforward palate delivers ripe black cherry and underbrush notes with a fine layer of smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Grassy aromas along with capsicum, nettle and green fruit aromas are pungent and exciting. The palate is spritzy and lively, while the flavor profile balances sweet, candied green fruit flavors with more driving, intense tastes of lime and green melon. Forward, fun and elevated; drink now for ultimate freshness.",Spain-Northern Spain:Verdejo
"A fine, spicy Pinot Noir, elegant and silky. There's lots of candied raspberry, cherry, orange zest and persimmon fruit and caramelized oak, so the wine tastes almost sweet, but it's actually dry.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This has a barrel-aged style, with a buttery and possibly oaky note in the aroma and a smooth texture. Mostly mellow pear and ripe apple flavors are spiced with a bit of vanilla and nutmeg. Medium bodied, it stays crisp through the finish.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Here's a Cabernet to lay down in the cellar for 6–8 years—or even longer. Two things mark it: the extremely ripe, concentrated blackberry and black currant fruit, and the hefty tannins. Most people will probably open it too soon and miss out on what it could be, when the tannins drop out to reveal its sweet fruity essence.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fleshy, almost overripe notes of cherry are prominent on the nose. The palate counters this with freshness but cannot contain the full, juicy and ripe impact of all of that ripe cherry fruit. Drink soon.",Austria-Burgenland:Blaufränkisch
"A family-owned vineyard on this famous slope in Morgon supplies the grapes to Duboeuf for the wine. It is structured and dense, full of black plum and berry flavors. Acidity cuts through the tannins, resulting in a wine that will age well. Drink from 2019.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay

"Juicy blackberry jam, anise and oak flavors abound in this dry, tannic Cabernet. The palate is a little sharp in texture, and it is unlikely to age well, so drink now.",US-California:Claret
"With the extra years of aging, this wine has smoothed itself out. It has lost that instant freshness of a young Muscadet and gained riper yellow and spice flavors that give it a full, rich character. There's just the right amount of acidity at the end to finish on a crisp note. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley:Melon
"This wine still appears to be coming out of its shell, showing some reduction with reticent notes of red plum, cherry and berry. The flavors are lipsmacking and rich, but it's difficult right now to get a clear sense of where it's all going.",Canada-British Columbia:Pinot Noir
"Aromas suggesting ripe berry, espresso, pressed rose and a whiff of camphor slowly take shape. The palate is focused but still extremely tight, offering morello cherry, dried sage and a hint of dark spice alongside assertive close-grained tannins that leave a firm finish. Give the tannins several more years to unclench then drink.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Apple and pear cider aromas mix with grapefruit peel, lime marmalade, peach blossoms and stone fruit on the nose of this rarely made varietal. The palate shows slightly sour, bitter apple peels and lemon skin.",US-California:Pinot Blanc

Similar flavors follow on the palate, and the texture is lean and refined, with very good fruit-to-acid balance.

"A landmark wine for those who love Italian sparklers, this shows loads of ripe apricot, melon and honey notes, with toasted nut and baked bread hints in the background. There are also touches of caramel and butterscotch that help move the wine's thick and opulent texture across the palate. It ends with refreshing acidity and tonic perlage.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Chardonnay
"Sophisticated in every way, this engaging, complex effort begins with fresh apple fruit, then layers in lemon curd and sliced orange components. There's a touch of beeswax, and a creamy mouthfeel that stretches out the finish.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"A branded Bordeaux, this shows the structure of the vintage while also being accessible and ready to drink now. It is dominated by Merlot which gives ripe berry fruits and a full, soft structure. Drink now and until 2018. Screwcap.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Chervil, lovage, watercress and yeast swirl headily on the nose. The palate subsumes these in a tight, taut, savory core of immense energy and power. There is muscle and tone, power and punch. If you are looking for a superlatively spicy, long-lived Grüner, this is the one to get. Underneath you will find notions of stone and earth that anchor this firmly. The finish is clean and long. Drink 2017–2020.",Austria-Wachau:Grüner Veltliner
"Supposedly Doña Paula's top selection for 2005, and while the wine shows some earthy darkness and plenty of fruit on the bouquet it doesn't follow up with the mouthfeel or overall balance that it should. It's ripe for sure, but also aggressive, with a disjointed acid-to-tannin ratio and an almost syrupy mouthfeel.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec

This opens with a slightly pungent note of ripe cantaloupe and apricot. Distant sweetness and touch of butterscotch or caramel is detected on the creamy finish.,Italy-Veneto:Glera

"Aromas of snap peas and freshly cut grass lead to tangy lemon and grapefruit flavors in this medium-bodied, crisply balanced wine. It's certainly lively and will cut through the thickest fettuccine Alfredo.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"With a touch of raisins and some heat in the finish, this is a pretty ripe Zinfandel. It's not for the faint-hearted. But it's classic California Zin, offering huge blackberry, cola, mocha and black pepper flavors that go on and on into a long finish. Demands rich fare, especially spicy, saucy barbecue.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Buttered sourdough toast and a slight nuttiness kick off another excellent Chardonnay from the ever-reliable Talley. The palate is greeted with minerality that fades into an apple butter flavor alongside a pinch of cinnamon, culminating in a graceful vanilla finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Michael David continues to showcase some of the more unusual grape varieties. This Tannat is big shouldered, rich and decadent, and it tastes brambly, which Zinfandel fans will appreciate. It's full of jammy red fruit and leather notes, with a long finish.",US-California:Tannat
"A very nice wine, kind of a mongrel with its array of varietals, but rich and satisfying.

The blend is Viognier, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Pinot Gris.",US-California:White Blend

"A blend of Sangiovese, Canaiolo and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas suggesting mature dark-skinned fruit, toast, sunbaked earth and cooking spice. On the polished, straightforward palate, hints of clove, orange peel and anise back up a core of dried black cherry while close-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2018.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend

So balanced, so lush, it just dazzles. Drink now through 2012 or thereabouts. Winery only.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"For a value-priced wine (especially considering its large-format bottling), this unassuming Riesling offers a bounty of juicy, fruity enjoyment calibrated with hints of minerality and revitalizing freshness.

"Deep purple in color, with an inky nose that brings licorice and jammy black fruit aromas.

Finishes sweet and chocolaty; could use a bit more structure and spine.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Syrah
"Violets, leather, vanilla, subtle oak and black berry sensations all meld together in the glass. The rich, concentrated palate delivers ripe black cherry and blueberry extract accented by mocha, cinnamon, clove, white pepper and mineral.

"Subtle aromas of white fruits, talc and powdered sugar are totally what they should be given that this is an extra dry Cava. The palate is a little sudsy and active, but the flavors of citrus and white pepper are balanced and not overly sweet or confected. Shows good clarity from start to finish.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"Earthy aromas suggesting grilled porcini, leather, tilled soil and balsam lead the nose. The dense, chewy palate offers mature black cherry, raspberry, licorice and dried sage flavors, set against a tannic backdrop that needs time to soften. A tobacco note signals the close. Drink 2022–2032.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese

"Fully oaked plum and berry aromas are dense and inviting. This feels flush and full, with scratchy tannins.

"This is a reserve-style bottling based on barrel selections of the winery's extensive portfolio.

With brisk acidity, it's a rich wine that should be enjoyed now.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Succulent and thick, with generous fruit flavors of apple, peach, nectarine and pear, this almost-decadent take on Chardonnay breaks the mold for Oregon.

"The wine was fermented in open stone lagars, still the preferred method at many Douro quintas. That gives the color and the soft extraction in this ripe, sweet Port. It has enough tannins to balance the dried raisin and superripe plum flavors. While it has been bottled to drink now, the wine will benefit from aging. Drink from 2016.",Portugal-Port:Port
"Light oak and spice aromas blend with baked berry, graphite and vanilla scents. This feels grabby, with gritty, lightly stalky flavors of leather that overshadow the wine's modest fruit components.

"A deep ruby wine with brilliant reflections. It has a youthful, fruit-driven nose backed by mineral undertones.

"There's a pleasant, toasty seam throughout the nose and mouth of this well-balanced wine, expressed in notes of sweet spice and honeycomb that frame the yellow melon and apple fruit core. It's plush and mouthfilling, but not flabby or overdone, thanks to balancing acidity and an assertive spicy tone that dominates the finish. Drink now.",South Africa-Stellenbosch:Chardonnay

Drink through 2023.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo

"Lush and oaky, this is a full-bodied mouthful of coffee, chocolate and loam flavors. The fruit is so ripe it presents as chocolate, framed by toasty oak and buttressed by incredibly soft tannins. The softness suggests pairing with roasts or braised meats; drink now–2012.",Australia-South Australia:Cabernet Sauvignon

As a whole it's tasty, balanced and expressive. For a day-to-day Cabernet, this one is recommended.",Chile-Central Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon

"This rich, chocolaty blend combines Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux varieties with 24% Petite Sirah. Deep red cherry and cassis flavors form its juicy core—a full-bodied expression accented by leather and espresso, and offset by a showy backbone of acidity.",US-California:Red Blend
"There's a raw, vinous quality to this wine that is made even more apparent thanks to the enormous thickness and extraction of its mouthfeel. You almost smell the winery here and get a good whiff of the freshness and overall maturity of the fruit. Its texture is extra chewy and plush.",Italy-Piedmont:Barbera

"Enticing aromas of balsamic, leather, menthol, crushed herb, blue flower and dark culinary spice unfold on the nose.

"This opens with vanilla and sweet, powdery aromas. In the mouth, it's bubbly and foamy, with a mix of pickled citrus and dry apple flavors. The finish is crisp and dry like a soda cracker.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"This smooth and detailed wine mixes tart red fruits with earthy, lightly charred flavors. The robust tannins carry notes of espresso beans and dark chocolate. It will need decanting and/or aeration to bring it all into proper balance.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"A true GSM in its comingling of 67% Grenache with 24% Syrah and 9% Mourvèdre, this wine is burly in red and black cherry, while retaining a softness of texture and powerfully generous body weight. Cinnamon and earth round out the finish.",US-California:G-S-M
"Spicy toast and wood aromas are the prelude to a wine that is extra soft, velvet almost, only hinting at tannins. The acidity is what gives structure to this wine, the berry and fig flavors rounding it out.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"Rich, wood-aged wine that shows ripe blackberry juice flavors to balance the firm tannins. It has good depth, structure and weight, a ripe and good value Bordeaux.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Persistently murky and leafy on the nose, this traditional-style Rioja brings juicier, brighter fruit to the palate along with some tangy, somewhat sharp acids. In the folds, a dash of oak brings vanilla and additional tannin into the picture. Improves with airing.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Fattoria La Massa has produced an exciting wine that will appeal to those who love a big, opulent style. A blend of Sangiovese and Merlot, this boasts an inky appearance, and delivers enormous tones of tobacco, leather, coffee bean, blue flowers and lead pencil. It's soft and lush and certainly does not lack power or concentration.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"This wine is  refreshing, its red fruit juice laced with acidity and a touch of herbs. Easy and light to drink.",France-Provence:Rosé
"This has delicious red-fruit nuances that are backed by espresso, spice and leather tones. There's a meaty, savory quality that would pair well with breaded veal or lasagna. This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"One sniff and you will be able to peg this as cool-climate SB. The nose is full of nettle and gooseberry aromas, while the palate feels trim and citrusy. Flavors of gooseberry, nettle and green bean leave a tropical note on the finish. This shows fine acidity but narrow, raw flavors.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Strikingly aromatic of plums, briar and menthol, this is a brisk, elegant Pinot Noir with concentrated but crisp red-fruit flavors. Tones of granite and penetrating, velvety tannins add structure and style.",US-New York:Pinot Noir
"On first pour, the aromas of toast, char, spice and herb show some reduction that blows off over time. The purple-fruit flavors are lighter in style, showing a pleasing sense of purity, with the concentration dipping in the middle before coming back together on the finish.",US-Washington:Malbec
"A 50-50 blend of Inzolia and Viognier, this feels slender and tight on the palate, with a drying note of talcum powder behind the flavors of citrus, honeysuckle and stone fruit.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:White Blend
"Initially tannic, this concentrated wine shows itself to be young, with its structure still waiting to open. A dry texture lies over the big berry flavors that will develop over the next year.",Portugal-Alentejo:Portuguese Red
"The term “Rutherford Bench” is not a legal one, but colloquially refers to the west side of Highway 29, where the wines, supposedly, are better. And this is quite a good wine. It's fresh and young in sweet tannins and acidity; everything's not quite integrated yet, but it's a big, rich, complexly balanced wine. Should come into its own by 2008, then hold for some years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of dark berry steeped in spirits, baking spice, crushed flower, mocha, eucalyptus and pipe tobacco come together on this stunning wine. The firm palate boasts more fruit than many from this vintage, delivering juicy dark cherry, ripe raspberry, vanilla, cake spice and licorice alongside firm but refined tannins and bright acidity. It's youthfully assertive but balanced, with serious aging potential. Drink 2021–2041.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"A rounded wine, all comfortable fruits and texture. There is a nice bite of lime juice acidity to sharpen up the gentle character, as well as some toast to add spice. An attractive, already mature wine.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This is a wine that preserves its freshness well. A touch of wood appears on the nose, fragrant and perfumed in character. It has a delicious, mature feel that makes it ready to drink. Jamminess on the finish lends weight and density.",France-Provence:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Barrel-fermented and aged on the lees, this Burgundian-style Chard is creamy and rich in ripe tropical fruit flavors and new oak. It's a big wine, forward in pineapple and mango flavors that are honey-ripe and crisp.",US-California:Chardonnay
"An earthy, black-pepper aroma and classic blackberry, raspberry and brambly spice components make this a fine example of Zinfandel. It is full bodied, mouthfilling and generous in flavor, benefitting from good acidity and moderate, fine-grained tannins for structure.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Floral in jasmine and apple blossom, this wine offers a solid foundation of baked apple and sizable oak, still youthfully wound up in concentrated richness. Moderate acidity helps keep things in check, as lengthy complexity comes to bear on the finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This négociant wine, made at a large custom crush facility in Mattawa, Washington, shows traces of the crisp fruit and lively flair of more substantial efforts. But it feels a little faded, and falls a little flat. Not bad, just vin ordinaire.",US-Washington:Riesling
"Opulent richness combines with an aromatic delicacy, with honey, orange and acacia. The freshness and acid-sweetness balance of Castelnau are already accessible.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This has subdued aromas suggesting aromatic herb, forest floor, truffle and a whiff of leather. It's assertive and rather lean in terms of fruit richness, displaying sour cherry, pomegranate, espresso, clove and a note of powdered sage. Tight, grainy tannins leave a firm finish.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Made in the full-blown, barrel-fermented and -aged style, this wine shows off the cooper's art in its bold toasty-caramelly-vanilla aromas and flavors. Some peach fruit manages to sneak through the wooden stockade, providing a hint of balance.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"If chocolate-covered cherries could be liquefied, this wine is what they would taste like. It is delicious, fruity, soft in texture, maybe slightly sweet, and so easygoing and tempting that it's hard to stop sipping. Note that it's deceptively full in body.",US-California:Red Blend
"Less immediately accessible than the 2005, the 2006 is tight and tart and almost seems encased in some sort of a shell. The fruit is concentrated raspberry and plum, and the acids taste natural while the tannins are polished and proportionate. The wine stays focused and strong through a very long finish that dapples in toasted coconut and chocolate malt. If you are a Rollat collector (and you should be) this would be the wine to cellar for five or six years, waiting for the Edouard to come into full flower.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Although Pinot Grigios are white wines, you could consider this a rosé instead because of its luminous copper color. The wine boasts a thick, creamy consistency and has a generous, plush feel in the mouth. It's a special and carefully crafted wine.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Grigio
"There's a grittiness or tightness of texture here that recalls carob or dried prune. This quality makes for an interesting, food-friendly red that is further colored by tones of chocolate, leather and pipe tobacco. Pulpy, dark concentration is backed by drying tannins.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"This gorgeous wine's nose offers a potpourri of fragrant blue flowers, exotic spices, crushed herbs and wild berries.

Drink 2022–2034.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"This selection is from the winery's first planted vineyard, now nearing 20 years of age. It's all Pommard clone, offering a burst of pretty cherry fruit backed with stiff tannins and a streak of iron. Still showing some sharp edges, it's just out of 15 months in 50% new oak, and will benefit from aerating or further bottle age.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"A beautiful pale-pink color, this rosé made from 50% Grenache, 30% Cinsault and 20% Syrah offers a gorgeous mélange of upfront fruit aromas, including red cherry, strawberry, peach and underripe mango. Hints of sweet pea and garrigue mingle with the ripe fruit core on the medium-bodied palate. The lightly creamy mouthfeel is lifted by bright final acidity, finishing snappy and fresh.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon:Rosé
"Fresh-cut grass and green-floral notes lend vibe to heady apricot aromas on this ripe, rich, lusciously textured Riesling. Dry in style yet bold in body and alcohol, it's kept in balance by a streak of nervy acidity. Finishes with a flair of potpourri and floral perfume.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling

"This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zinfandel, Merlot and Malbec. The grapes are entirely from Sonoma County. It's a tannic, lusty and ultimately satisfying wine, with jammy berry and spice flavors.",US-California:Red Blend
"This voluptuously seductive wine is also elegantly balanced.

Many of the vines on the site date back nearly 40 years, a demonstration that in age there is beauty.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This dry wine has an appealing fruit character, light spiciness and a firm grip of tannin. It will pair well with roast birds or grilled sausages.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A little baked in fruit, with jammy cherry, black raspberry, red currant and pomegranate flavors that taste caramelized. Not likely to age well, but tasty now and for a year or so.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Presenting at first as somewhat reduced, this wine is tart and feral, with a muskiness reminiscent of mushroom and forest floor. Its intensely voluptuous body is concentrated in black cherry, cola and cardamom, with a richness and roundness on the palate and finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Spice and smoky oak aromas blend with perfumed berry scents and candy in front of an astringent palate with plum, cherry and smoky aftertones. Dark, minty flavors on the finish are matched by hard, rubbery tannins. Time in bottle could be a benefit.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec

"Sleepy and tannic, this wine is elusive in fruit both aromatically and on the palate, showing more green, herbal character than cherry or berry. Still, it is hugely full bodied and wrapped forcefully in oak, providing a dry finish.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A mouthwateringly fresh wine, its acidity giving a classic steely, mineral texture. The citrus fruit is fresh, while it also has a rounded character. Toast from wood aging adds another softer aspect.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Lightweight and silky in texture, this is a dry, refreshing rosé to drink while the warm weather persists. Hints of bubblegum detract slightly, but the primary notes of melon, citrus and wet stone combine easily on the palate.",France-Rhône Valley:Rosé
"Suave aromas of bramble and red berries meet with chipped slate, a touch of anise and pressed lilacs on this nose of this blend of 37% Grenache, 29% Mourvèdre, 13% Syrah, 10% Counoise, 6% Cinsault and 5% Carignane. Bright cranberry and red cherry fruit pop on the palate, which is bolstered by fennel, black peppercorns and dried rose petals.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Intensely ripe, jammy and toasty aromas and equally effusive fruit flavors make this full-bodied wine easy to enjoy. It seems to overflow with boysenberry and blackberry, and has a touch of wood smoke from oak.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This opens with a fruit-driven bouquet of cherry and raspberry, with a red rose note. It shows a soft but slightly textured feel, with smoky endnotes of old spice and leather.",Italy-Piedmont:Dolcetto
"A bit heavy now, with lots of unintegrated parts. The new oak sticks out from the tannins, and the blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit is all primary and jammy. If you drink now, decant, but this 100% Cab should be better after 2010.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a mellifluous blend of the three Champagne grapes with a dominance of ripe Pinot Noir. A crisp, dry edge brings out the acidity and a mineral texture. The wine is ready to drink.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Though quite pale in color due to no barrel aging, there is a nicely rounded candy nose of bright green apple and vanilla, alongside some sharper spice. On the palate, more green apple dominates, along with lemon-lime, slight guava and an acidity that causes the wine to dance across the tongue.",US-California:Chardonnay
"In a soft and jammy style, packed with red berries and given a plummy juiciness. The structure is here, the fruit hanging on to it, giving the wine a gentle, final feel.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Fragrant and liquorous, this opens with scents of berry and cherry and spice, lightly lifted with floral accents. The wine is a pretty ruby color, and it walks the line between open and closed, poised right on the fence. There is a sharp spicy streak, which wraps into the graphite and mineral character of the vineyard.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Tight and crisp initially, this wine opens up with spice, ripe flavors and a touch of minerality. Taut and textured, it needs to age; drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Equal parts Viognier and Roussanne, this wine displays notes of peach, lees and spice. The palate is broad in feel with stone-fruit flavors and a tart finish.",US-Washington:White Blend
"Rich with gooey marshmallow, crème brûlée and cotton candy aromas, this is an unabashed classic California Chardonnay from Austin Hope. Unctuous marzipan and sea salt caramel flavors make for a creamy mouthfeel, and yet firm acidity leaves the midpalate feeling clean, allowing butterscotch tones to linger on the finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Rich and spicy, with oak-influenced green apple, pear, peach and citrus flavors, brightened with fine acidity. The finish seems pretty sweet, making the wine more off-dry than dry.",US-California:Pinot Grigio
"Ryan Patrick's reserve is pure Cabernet Sauvignon, though not labeled as such. It's a barrel selection, and very well done, with a purity and density that is most expressive. The acids and youthfulness of the fruit flavors suggest that this is a wine with aging potential. For now, it's showing bright, tart, tangy red fruits and fine balance.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"This shows the textural depth of all the Efesté wines. A floral top note gives way to firm, dark, cassis and blackberry flavors. Light notes of herb, anise and earth are introduced and set comfortably into the lengthy finish. It has great power and flavor, with the possibility of cellaring for a decade or more.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"Although this Zin has a touch of overripeness in the form of raisins covered in chocolate, followed by a lot of blackberry and foxy mulberry. The wine is dry, smooth and balanced, with plenty of complexity.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Dusty aromas of apple and vanilla break up fast as the wine shows oxidized notes. The palate feels narrow and lemony, while the flavor profile is one dimensional and settles on lemon and tart apple. On the finish, things turn stalky in flavor and acidic in feel.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño
This is a young- looking wine that tastes equally fresh. Red fruits and soft tannins are balanced with acidity It tastes too young to be a true tawny with no hint of any nutty maturity.,Portugal-Port:Port
"Earthy in character, this is a rustic wine. It does have attractive red fruits, and balancing acidity but these elements come up against a barnyard character and firm tannins.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"Opens with vanilla and minerality along with standard apple and peach aromas. It's a bit darker and more tan in color than what you'd expect, with fine acidity and integration throughout. Shows touches of white pepper, nutmeg and dried papaya on a classy finish. Dry and subtle at all points.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño
"There are sweet-tasting notes of wild berry and raspberry at the front of this wine, followed by fresh touches of white flower and lemon blossom. Those feminine aromas are enhanced by an impression of soft sweetness.",Italy-Southern Italy:Rosato
"Almost black in color, this is a hugely dense, dark wine. It brings out the tannic side of the grape with hints of black coffee and dark chocolate. Under all this concentration, there is some fruit that is still waiting to get out: black plum and black currants with fresh acidity. Just wait until 2017.",Portugal-Lisboa:Touriga Nacional
"Transparent in color, with a nose that is equally light and airy, this is a crisp, dry, slightly oaky wine, with a hard-smacking palate. Red plum, raspberry, strawberry and currant flavors are subdued, and lead to a sweet-and-sour finish.",Spain-Catalonia:Garnacha
"This was pressed whole-cluster and fermented in French oak, roughly one-third new. It's a flavorful wine with caramel apple appeal, good definition and medium length. The barrels put a pleasing toasty frame around the finish.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"Soft stewy raisiny aromas are not problematic but they do suggest a wine that's a bit overripe, which isn't surprising for 2012—a notoriously hot year. A heavy palate is a touch mushy but also tannic. Candied flavors of cherry and cassis are raisiny, while this is plodding and chocolaty on the finish.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This medium sweet wine is indeed quite sweet even on the nose, where honey, apple blossoms and night jasmine aromas show. There is tingling acidity to the sip that cuts through the strong sweetness. Would pair well with a rich pork dish.",US-California:Gewürztraminer
"Understated stone fruit and mineral flavors dominate the palate, with peach-pit and citrus notes on the finish. Round and resinous in the mouth; nose offers a white peppery, plasticy bite.",Australia-South Australia:Riesling
"This is the Arnoux family's top wine coming from vines on the revered hill of Corton. It is a powerful wine, properly rich and structured from the vintage. Wood and spice come through although they will soon integrate with the dense black-plum fruits and mineral texture. Drink the wine from 2025.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Underbrush, dried tobacco leaf, dark-skinned fruit and espresso aromas form in the glass. The firm palate offers crushed red cherry, licorice, tobacco and sage alongside tightly woven tannins that need time to unwind. Drink 2020–2030.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese

"This is rather closed but eventually reveals aromas of oak, coffee bean and espresso. The palate delivers ripe blackberry, licorice and baking spices alongside astringent tannins. It's also a bit shy on fresh acidity.",Italy-Central Italy:Sagrantino
"Thick and luscious with deep oak tones and big cherry fruit flavors, this southern Italian red is a real fruit bomb with plush cherry intensity and ripe berry flavors. The strong sunshine has done its part to shape a thick, succulent red wine.",Italy-Southern Italy:Red Blend
"This is a dry wine although the fruit does show potential. It is concentrated and firm, tannins foremost. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This ripe wine is smooth and creamy, fresh with acidity and rich with red fruits. Open and generous, it will make a great apéritif.",France-Provence:Rosé

"Earthy, musky notes lend a savory complexity to this bold, richly bodied Pinot Gris. Dry in style, it juxtaposes crisp white grapefruit and lime flavors against hints of smoked nuts. The finish is brisk and mineral.",US-New York:Pinot Gris

"Made from 50% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 20% Mourvèdre, this is a thick, extracted exploration of strawberry and leather. Bright and brawny, it has supportive freshness and acidity beneath the power of its meaty ripe fruit.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend

"Apricot jam and late-harvest botrytis flavors are often characteristic of this vineyard. This is bone dry, with brisk acidity and stony minerality. It will gradually lose fruit over the years.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Pronounced FOO-kway, this is the highest in alcohol but the lowest in flavor of the Erath line up. The first bottle tasted flat, leafy and dull, but a second bottle was significantly improved. Nonetheless it appears to be aging quickly, with an astringent, tannic finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Rooty, spicy aromas of black plum are more complex than those of your average Malbec. In the mouth, this shows a heavy, almost reduced mouthfeel that could use more spring. Dark, heavily toasted baked-plum flavors finish peppery and brooding, but without much texture or presence. Drink soon.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"This wine is made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, with tiny additions of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A minty, menthol streak is strong on the nose, veering into almost eucalyptus, while dried herb and a shot of gunpowder provide additional savory aromas and flavors. Big tannins need time in the glass to mellow.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"A beautiful and interesting Sauvignon Blanc that's as dry as anything out there, with no trade of unripeness. Crisp acids frame pure, clean flavors of gooseberries, citrons, limes and grapefruits, wrapped into a creamy texture. Brilliant with ceviche or by itself.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc

The medium-sweet stone-fruit and orange-peel flavors are direct and bring appeal. It goes down easy.,US-Washington:Riesling
"Lime, mineral and green herbs combine to create a nice aromatic opening. The palate is juicy and healthy, with flavors of jalapeño, lime and green apple. Finishes solid and quite long for a basic SB. Well made and tasty.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"This offers a glimpse onto Amarone tradition and heritage. Rather offering modern tones of spice and chocolate, this has ethereal aromas of wild berry, cassis, licorice, cola and dried apple skin. Bight acidity brings up the finish.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This Pinot Noir offers plenty of varietal pleasure. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with cherry skin, red currant and cola flavors.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"This Viognier was grown in a warm climate, and that has made it slightly soft but enormously ripe. It offers a blast of tropical fruit, wildflower, Asian pear, buttered toast, caramel cream and spicebox flavors. There's a honeyed richness through the long finish, but the wine is fundamentally dry.",US-California:Viognier
"Aromas of black tar, chocolate and berries lead to a wine that is so effortlessly delicious that it's easy to forget the power the Merlot gives it. The center is round, but dark, filled with sweetness; the outer layers are full of red jelly and toast. There are tannins, but they, too, are sweet.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Sheldrake's Riesling begins with nosings of pear, apple and spice, and on the palate, offers apple and citrus with a minerally edge. Friendly and crisp, it's a good summer sip or cohort to Thai cuisine or grilled seafood.",US-New York:Riesling
"The deep black color of this wine suggests that it spent a lot of time on the skins, and 20 months in American oak added further grip and grit to the tannins. Cherry tobacco, espresso and plenty of oak flavors lead into a chewy finish with some residual bitterness.",US-Oregon:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Magenta-tinted and ready to go; that in a nutshell is this easy, no-oak blend of Tempranillo and Grenache. It's fruity to the max, with aromas of boysenberry and black cherry as well as similar flavors. Ripe and easy to drink.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Some years, even the top wines suffer, and in a cold 2013, Alion is not what it normally is. For starters, this is far more tight, tannic, raw and pulling than its track record. Toasty oak is a big player, creating creamy aromas and toast on the finish. In between are crisp, peppery blackberry flavors. This wine may improve with time. Drink 2018–2028.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"This wine is put together from multiple vineyard sources, including the well-known Morelli Lane and Widdoes, all farmed by the Duttons. Larger in production than many of the vineyard-designates, it offers baked bread and juicy overtones of cranberry-raspberry layered atop luxuriously toasted oak. It'll show well at the table.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This soft wine has a smooth texture and and a ripe strawberry flavor. It is rounded, easy and approachable.",France-Provence:Rosé
"While this wine shows some of the softness and richness of 2003, it keeps a light touch and the acidity and black fruits remain fresh. There is an edge of astringency that leaves a hard aftertaste.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A zippy, lively version, this light-bodied wine smells and tastes like a combo of grapefruit, lemon and peach juices, having a crisp character on first sip, and a rich softness on the second.",US-California:Pinot Grigio
"The three guys in question are former professional football players who shared a love of wine, enough to launch this small-production project. It delivers juicy apple and pear in a lusciously creamy texture that shows a hint of stony minerality and nutmeg, the fruit coming back to the fore on the powerful finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This vintage of Grattamacco's basic Bolgheri blend (mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Sangiovese) appears neutral and less intense compared to years past. It does show elegant mineral shadings and cedary wood behind bright berry fruit.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Touches of flint play subtly on this elegantly restrained wine. A central seam of fresh, mineral acidity also provides an extended finish. This strikes great harmony between a rounded but defined body, streamlined acidity and a mineral background.",Austria-Südsteiermark:Sauvignon Blanc
"This luxury Cava is entirely clean and pure on the bouquet. The palate is bright, lifted and zesty for a 2006, with apple, dry spice and lingering citrus notes. The body is defined by its yeasty weight and foam but it's not heavy or dull. Only 100 cases of this beauty were made. Drink now–2015.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"Fossacolle's Brunello is distinguished by a chewy texture that is backed by dark concentration and plump berry fruit. The cherry and blackberry layers are thick and soft, but don't let them fool you; Sangiovese's characteristic acidity keeps the palate polished and pristine.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Richly oaked aromas of maple and mocha accent earthy, rubbery berry scents. This is muscled-up and edgy on the palate, with flavors of tobacco, mocha, plum and berry fruits. A grabby, slightly collapsed finish contains earthy, savory flavor remnants. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"Beautifully pale in color, this is the latest release of Cristal Rosé. It is ripe and full in the mouth, packed with fruit and also with intense acidity that cuts through the soft texture. There is a hint of bottle age, giving the wine a toasty complexity that brings a balance to this great wine. Drink now, although this vintage will certainly last to 2020 and beyond.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"A perfect companion to the fall harvest season, this easy-drinking Riesling is evocative of candied apples and warm apple pie spice. There's not a lot of complexity, but it's light and fresh in the mouth with a puckery lime and sour patch candy finish.",US-New York:Riesling
"Made from dense, rich, perfumed Baga, this is a structured wine. Layers of wood aging and strong tannins give a dark, brooding character. The wine is balanced and almost ready to drink, but is always likely to be firm and dry. Drink from 2017.",Portugal-Bairrada:Baga
"The very pure scent of green Conference pear peel rises from the glass. It is soon tempered by peppery yeast notes, but characterized throughout but that dual nature of freshness and the plumpness of rounded yeast. This contrast provides interest and makes this rather moreish, especially once you've savored the long spicy finish.",Austria-Wagram:Grüner Veltliner
"The Australian producer tries its hand at California fruit, and this very straightforward bottling showing aromas of cranberries, raspberries and graphite. The palate is clean and familiar, with Bing cherries, oregano and black slate. It's a good-deal wine",US-California:Pinot Noir
"On the big and bold side, this has abundant fruit flavors surrounded by equally abundant lip-smacking tannins, great acidity and a long finish. Not very oaky, it has a vibrancy and fruit focus that is mouthwatering and compelling. It's tasty now, but will also improve through 2017.",US-California:Merlot
"Of all Testarossa's 2006 Pinots, this is the most complex, and also the most ageworthy. Offers a flood of cherry, red currant, Dr. Pepper, raspberry, licorice, vanilla cookie and oaky spice flavors that are fantastically intense and interesting. Interestingly, this bottling is one of Testarossa's highest-alcohol Pinots. Great now and for a good six more years.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Whether it's the biodynamic vineyard or the ripeness of the fruit, this is certainly a rich, full-bodied wine. It's fruity and forward, although it's structure and minerality lendimpressive character. The aftertaste is fruity, fresh and bone dry.",France-Alsace:Sparkling Blend
"Pronounced mature plum, black-skinned berry, vanilla, dark spice and French oak aromas lift out of the glass. The firm palate delivers dried wild cherry, roasted coffee, licorice and cocoa notes, while compact tannins provide support. Drink 2020–2028.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Golden in color, this is a creamy voluptuous white wine, fermented and aged entirely in new French oak. Melon, spicy nutmeg and fig build flavor around a core of thick texture and concentration, finishing in buttery toast.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Unmistakably Sauvignon Blanc, it carries notes of herbs, citrus and guava. It's lightly spritzy and drinks dry with mouthwatering citrus flavors. Try it with shellfish.",US-Oregon:Sauvignon Blanc
Nectarine and melon aromas are ripe and round on the nose. The palate feels big but properly balanced with acidity. Flavors of grapefruit and bell pepper are prominent over the pyrazine-heavy finish.,Chile-Casablanca Valley:Sauvignon Blanc

"Red-berry, rose, crushed herb, and espresso aromas come together on this while the dense palate doles out black cherry, fleshy raspberry, grilled herb and a hint of clove. Tightly wound, assertive tannins leave a firm finish. Drink 2018–2023.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Crisp and fruity though a little woody and austere on the nose, too, this Lodi Pinot Grigio is unoaked and not for everyone, but well made.",US-California:Pinot Grigio
"90–92. Barrel sample. This is a ripe and fruity wine with smooth tannins within a densely-textured palate. It's weighty in the mouth with richness, elegance and a purity of character. The acidity on the finish is already delicious.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This well-made, ripe wine has a good balance between its fresh black currant fruits and tannins that are already softening. It is a success for the vintage, emphasizing fruit and fresh acidity, and will likely be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Focused and dense, this intense wine captures the essence of ripe raspberries. Aged in 50% new French oak, it's got a strong vein of coffee and mocha. The flavors broaden out and penetrate, finishing with highlights of cedar, cinnamon and dark chocolate. Drink now through the 2020s, but decant if you want the full expression.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Loaded with smoke, hickory and vanilla, this definitely shows plenty of oak, but there's also plenty of fruit to balance the ledger. Cola and blackberry flavors pick up a slightly tart edge on the long, finely textured finish.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
"This powerful wine has big ideas, as indicated by the weight of the bottle. The wine itself is dense, showing some signs of extraction that give a dry and firm aspect to the wine. A juicy, black-plum aftertaste adds lift.",Portugal-Alentejo:Portuguese Red
"This is an attractive, fruity wine that's dominated by black currant and damson flavors. It is layered with acidity and light tannins. Drink this year.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"A fine value in Northern Rhône Syrah, the Tain cooperative's 2009 Crozes-Hermitage is fairly extracted for a Crozes, with plummy, dark fruit alongside hints of clove, leather and coffee. Turns a bit astringent on the finish; try 2013–2018.",France-Rhône Valley:Syrah
"This blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, easily recognizable for its fun label showing antique cars and cyprus trees, has earthy aromas that suggest leafy underbrush, wet soil, woodland berries and plum. The palate delivers black cherry accented with black pepper, espresso and menthol. Tightly woven and tannic, it will benefit with a few more years aging. Drink 2015–2019.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Blended from Umpqua Valley and Eola Hills grapes, this is forward and fruit-driven, with a pleasant mix of apple and pear. Along with the fruit comes a base of minerality and an unusual streak of spearmint.",US-Oregon:Pinot Gris
"With no rough edges and quite a bit of silky appeal, this earns points for its dry elegance. The flavors are elusive: At first there is a fresh, ripe cherry note, then an olive tapenade element and a moment later a rich earthiness. It is fairly tannic, however, and unlikely to age for very long. Drink now–2014.",US-California:Merlot
"Volatile and sharp, this well-aged (though current) release tastes of vanilla, maple syrup and cut tobacco. After lengthy aging (48 months) in 60% new oak, the wood flavors have taken over.",US-Oregon:Syrah
"Oxidized and mute, with mushy, nutty flavors and a similar finish. An underperformer that lacks freshness, purity and character.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Chardonnay
"This is a medium- to full-bodied wine, a bit chunky and edgy at first, but these characters should mellow with another few months in the bottle. It's boldly flavored, with black cherry and beet notes upfront, while subtle mocha and vanilla shadings emerge on the finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Pinot Noir
"This Cabernet Sauvignon blend includes Merlot, Syrah and a small amount of “other,” yielding a well-rounded, ripe wine with lush flavors of blueberry and blackberry. The tangy acids spark a finish of fresh herb, licorice and tobacco.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Half Zinfandel from Jack Rabbit Flat, half Petite Sirah, aged together in entirely new French oak, this is a weighty, brooding wine, rich in dark plum, blackberry, leather and black licorice. With a touch of espresso on the tightly tannic finish, it's a wine for cold nights and warm fires.",US-California:Red Blend
"Tingly acidity complements the lush, full-bodied concentration of this estate-grown beauty. It's both soft and sensual in tone. Pine, orange peel and pomegranate notes play against the richness and add freshness to the chewy tannin. Best enjoyed 2024 through 2034.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"“Gas station” isn't necessarily the most attractive fine-wine descriptor, but it's both apt and complimentary for a dry Riesling. This one reeks of petrol and tar. On the palate, a warm tar presence slowly evolves toward vanilla. A vibrant, tingling acidity indicates decent cellaring potential. At the very least, this is a great wine to show your friends how petrol can be a defining and excellent character in wine.",US-California:Riesling
"Baked apple and pressed white flower aromas take center stage on this structured white. The apple sensation follows through to the palate, along with nectarine, Mediterranean herb and a hint of nut. Bright acidity adds freshness.",Italy-Tuscany:Vernaccia
"Made using grapes grown in Jarvis's mountain vineyard, this is a strongly flavored Merlot. It's brilliant and intense, with flavors of red cherry pie, red licorice, grilled Canadian bacon and sandalwood. The tannic structure is a joy—soft, furry and complex. There's lots of oak, too, which lends a smoky edge. Probably at its best now, so drink up.",US-California:Merlot
"Done in a forward tutti–frutti style, this puts all the flavor right up front. Grape candy is what comes to mind, with a light tannic finish. It's a good gulping wine for decks, campers and picnic outings.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This is a lovely Chardonnay, filled with varietal character. The pear, tropical fruit and kiwi flavors are enhanced with sweet, toasty oak, buttered-toast and vanilla notes.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Juicy wine, just beginning to change from pure fruit to maturity. The tannins are still there, but more gently rounded with red berry fruits. The wine is ready to drink.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"Intriguing notes of sandalwood and cedar meet with dark red fruit and a touch of black pepper on the nose of this wine. The palate is layered with interesting touches of sage, marjoram, gravel and tar, hints of black cherry and loamy earth, and a chalky mouthfeel.",US-California:Merlot
"The full tilt of ripe peach hits the nose at once, followed by glimpses of marmalade and peach compote. The palate follows with the same aromatic intensity, enriching the peach compote notes even further with lemony barley sugar and fresh caramel, pierced by tangy citrus acidity. The flavors are mature and precise, opulent but tempered, and have a decadent touch. This is lovely now but has the concentration and drive to evolve. Drink now through 2030.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"The aromas suggest notes of green herbs, vanilla, freshly hewn wood and cherry. The flavors are lighter in style, with the tannins bringing some grit.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A good, robust, everyday Zinfandel, with some special features. It's soft and dry and very flavorful, offering waves of raspberries, cherries, mocha, spices and sandalwood. Gets a few extra points for the finely ground tannins and clean, brisk scour of acidity.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This is a ripe toasty wine. With its red-berry fruits and acidity along with some dry, smoky tannins it is a wine in progress. Drink this concentrated wine from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The flint soil of the Fiou domaine has given a magnificent rich wine. Yellow fruits, ripe citrus and beautifully perfumed acidity all contribute to a wine that is packed with flavor. The fruit is still crisply fresh and the mineral texture from the soil shows how well it will age. Drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Basilisco delivers a deeply volcanic expression of Aglianico, with aromas of dried fruit, crushed granite, lead pencil and exotic spice. Thanks to 18 months of oak aging, it also shows supple softness and a velvety texture that gives this usually austere wine an easy approach overall.",Italy-Southern Italy:Aglianico
"From a vineyard in the Atlas Peak foothills, this wine offers plummy black cherry fruit accented with clove, pepper and leather. Soft and well integrated on the palate, it shows a boldness of flavor that's powerful and earthy.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Taut and crisp compared to the softer, riper Magdalena or Josef Vineyard bottlings, this polished, steely wine is a showcase of brash mineral style. It's dry on the palate, but flavors of white grapefruit and lime seem kissed with a spray of honey. Drinks beautifully now but should continue to improve through at least 2025.",US-New York:Riesling
"It's good to see this Margaret River stalwart return to the States. The 2015 DJL is a slightly nutty, toasty wine, plump and silky in texture. Pear, melon, vanilla and citrus notes finish long.",Australia-Western Australia:Chardonnay
"An outstanding value, the latest release of this wine dazzles with bold, black cherry and chocolate mocha flavors. The focus and definition throughout are exceptional also. This is a gem at a more than fair tariff.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir

"This aromatic wine features melon, red apple skin and tropical notes. It drinks a hair off dry with a broad, rich feel to the fruit flavors.",US-Washington:Pinot Gris
"It's quite tannic, as is to be expected from this founding Red Mountain vineyard, and yet the wine seems smoothed over, buffed out. The black cherry and cassis fruit does not penetrate. Drink up.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"93-95 Barrel sample. Compact wine, bringing in juicy fruits and tannins into a complete, firm whole. A good success.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Made with organically farmed fruit, this bright Vernaccia di San Gimignano would pair with appetizers or elaborate salad lunches. It's a lively, crisp expression with aromas of kiwi, green apple and dried grass.",Italy-Tuscany:Vernaccia
"A good Chardonnay that offers plenty of tropical fruit, pear and sweet, smoky oak flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. But Ridge hasn't been known as a source of great Chardonnay for years, and this '08 doesn't change that. It's seriously overpriced.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Labels like this one are probably what confuse American consumers, but the truth is that this is just great wine. Peach and mineral notes with a generous squirt of lime mark the nose, followed by a round, juicy midpalate and with lots of fruit and lots of minerality. It's lush, yet structured with firm acids on the long finish.",Germany-Pfalz:Riesling
"Cranberry and a strong herbal component contribute an earthy elegance to this 100% Cab which zigzags somewhat on the palate, becoming fuller bodied. Still, the oak and tannins are under control and the wine is approachable now.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

"From vines to the south of the Côte des Blancs, this estate-grown Champagne has much of the same tight texture and minerality. It is taut and crisp while keeping plenty of room for apple and citrus fruitiness. This fresh wine could certainly take some bottle aging. Drink now, but better from late 2016.",France-Champagne:Chardonnay
"Old vines give extra concentration to this rich wine. With fruitiness, a tight texture and the need to age, it has structure and density. Drink from 2015.",France-Alsace:Riesling

"Subtle aromas of cherry and cinnamon spice are followed by an overly tart, acidic character on this wine from historic Brotherhood. Light and somewhat one dimensional, it does have a clean finish and its minerality will recommend it to food pairing.",US-New York:Pinot Noir
Borgoluce is the type of brut sparkling wine that shows all that easy-drinking informality we love to find in Prosecco Superiore. White flower and citrus are the main aromatic elements and the wine is bright and sharply crisp in the mouth.,Italy-Veneto:Glera
"Past vintages of Imperial Gran Reserva have seemed sharp and dilute; not the 1998, which is resolute in its delivery of cumin, root beer and subtle raspberry aromas. The palate has nice primary cherry and berry flavors, solid tannins and welcome but not overwhelming acidity. Notice a touch of dill and butter on the finish, a reflection of traditional American oak aging.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"This 100% Sangiovese wine opens with fragrant blue flower and underbrush scents. Juicy red cherry fills out the palate, with clove and a ground pepper note. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese

"This is dark and brooding, showing earthy aromas of tilled earth, leather and farmyard. The palate is big and ripe, with black fruit, nutmeg and white pepper flavors.",Italy-Veneto:Red Blend
"This starts out appealing. Licorice, spice, coconut and vanilla aromas are entirely inviting. On the palate it delivers a tight deck of lemony oak, raspberry fruit, spice and vanilla. This finishes fiery and with a sinewy structure. Drink this Cabernet-led, five-grape blend through 2019; 500 cases made.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Red Blend
"While sleek and slender in style, there's a steely intensity to this well-priced dry Riesling. It's deeply mineral, wafting of smoke and crushed slate, and vibrantly acidic, but the midpalate yields nicely, offering layers of ripe honeydew and grapefruit. It's silken in texture, with a lingering chalkiness on the finish.",Germany-Rheingau:Riesling
"This blend of 40% Mourvèdre, 25% Grenache, 23% Syrah, 9% Cinsault and 3% Counoise offers boysenberry, hot bricks and condensed violets on the nose. The palate is quite pleasant with olallieberry jam flavors alongside sanguine elements and dark slate on the edges, altogether quite light and easy to drink.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Extraordinarily delicious is more like it. This is full bodied, supple and rich, with luscious aromas and flavors of mocha, cassis and vanilla that finish long, with some soft, dusty tannins. With all the plushness and primary fruit, it seems a little young right now; drink 2018–2030.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
"Aged for two-plus years in mixed oak barrels, this has not yet proved it can handle all of that wood. Tannic and aggressively oaky, it carries little fruit and varietal character.",US-Oregon:Tempranillo
"High alcohol gives this wine a distinct burn. The cherry fruit has a roasted fruit portiness, although the finish is entirely dry. Oak adds chocolaty toastiness. It's a good example of a big, ripe California red wine. Give it a good decanting and drink now.",US-California:Cabernet Franc
"Foot treading during fermentation, plus aging in French oak or large vats for four years makes this a special sort of Ruby. It is in a dry style, with a good balance between the wood and the juicy red-berry fruits. The wine is ready to drink.",Portugal-Port:Port
"Dense blueberry, concentrated purple flowers and a touch of tar show on the nose of this bottling of a fairly rare grape in the region. The palate intrigues with tar, beef crust and tart, tannic elderberry fruit, but it's quite wound up in a very solid structure that still needs time to unwind.",US-California:Malbec
"This is the inaugural release from this Oregon-based winery, with the fruit coming from Loess and Seven Hills vineyards. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (54%), Merlot (38%) and Petit Verdot, it offers laromas of pencil box, high-toned flowers, bittersweet chocolate, herbs and barrel spices. The flavors show depth and intensity as well as exquisite balance and length.",US-Oregon:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This blend of Rolle, Ugni Blanc and Clairette is bright and tangy. It offers a definite herbal flavor as well as ripe yellow fruits integrated into a texture that is crisp and mineral. The wine is ready to drink.",France-Provence:Provence white blend
"This is smelling a bit oxidized and wayward. Spritzy in feel, this blend of 70% Albariño, 15% Loureira and 15% Treixadura tastes pithy and like citrus skins. Pithy, borderline bitter flavors of white grapefruit drive the finish.",Spain-Galicia:White Blend
"Fig and raisin aromas blend with damp earth and animal notes on the nose of this grippy, bumpy crianza lacks focus but is still quite good. Black cherry, herbal plum and toasty oak flavors finish sticky and with lasting oak. Drink through 2025.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
This new sister label from Elk Cove offers 100% Willamette Valley Pinot Noir at an everyday price. Fresh cranberry and raspberry fruit is framed by herb-tinged tannins.

"Lots of bang for the buck in this rich, fruity Chardonnay. It hits it right down the middle in solid popular appeal, with New World tropical fruit, citrus and peach flavors wrapped into a buttercream texture and liberally accented with smoky oak.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Sweet and smoky to start with, and with its mild roasted nose it draws you in. The palate is big, boisterous and generous, but also under control as it delivers pure boysenberry, blackberry and chocolate flavors. Toasty and long, and impressive for an $11 wine.",Chile-Central Valley:Carmenère
"Milk chocolate and sweet cherry aromas appear alongside cured meat and plump black fruit. This is a straightforward Brunello with a creamy, soft close.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Earthy ripeness of peach and yellow plum abounds. The palate is rounded and medium sweet, suggesting jellied and crystallized fruit confections with an appetizingly tart edge. Drink soon.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"This firmly structured, dense wine is packed with dark plum and fig fruits, laced with chocolate and tannins.

Like many wines from this year, it is likely to mature quickly, so drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir

"Nutty and sweaty smelling. There's life and acidity to the palate, but the flavors of pickled fruits turn bitter and seem less than clean. Doesn't start that well and never improves.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Chardonnay
"For big-red lovers, this is a darn classy option. Savory, smokey, meaty notes are woven together with black pepper, raspberry and red cherry. The palate is plush and powerful, but the tannins are well structured and balanced, with a long, savory finish. Drink now–2025.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
"A simple Zinfandel, with sweet, spicy pie filling berry and cherry flavors. It has some extra features of minerality that are interesting, but it's still fundamentally one-dimensional.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Plump boysenberry and dewy sagebrush meet with a touch of wet asphalt on the nose of this bottling by Bob Lindquist, whose pioneering brand is now part of Charles Banks' portfolio. Dark purple fruits, from blueberry to blackberry, show on the palate, but with refreshing tartness, as do more complex nuances of menthol, eucalyptus and incense.",US-California:Syrah
"This wine starts with a shock of acidity, followed by a ripe blackberry note. It is upright, structured and still young, and its sweetness is just beginning to show through the tannins and acidity. Give it 3–4 years.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine is appealing for its smooth mouth-feel, mildly spicy aromas and dried-fruit flavors. Medium to full bodied, it also tastes mellow and mature, with no rough edges poking out.",US-California:Red Blend
"This is a juicy, fruit-forward selection, boasting vibrant notes of red cherry, raspberry and strawberry on the nose and mouth. A hint of vanilla adds a sweetness to the finish, which otherwise ends clean and mouthwatering. Drink now.",France-France Other:Pinot Noir
"Quite dark in color for an unblended Grenache, this wine is full of plum and ripe raspberries with the tartness of the 2010 vintage on display. The oak—half new French—plays a bit too prominently in the show on this otherwise enjoyable wine.",US-Washington:Grenache
"While this Pinot has gorgeous, generous raspberry, cola, mushroom and sweet oak flavors, it also possesses a superb structure of tannins and acids that makes it successful. In that sense, it's a masterful balance of power and elegance, and is distinctly Pinot Noir-esque in its silky texture. Drink now–2017, depending on your taste for older Pinot.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Colle Ara opens with a light copper color that reflects the natural hue of the grape skins of Pinot Grigio. The aromas include white almond, grapefruit and peach cobbler and the mouthfeel is fresh but creamy at the same time.",Italy-Veneto:Pinot Grigio
"Rough-hewn and tannic in youth, this blend of one-third each Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot isn't showing much accessibility. It's astringently closed, but very ripe and sweet in blackberries, cherries and cedar. Give it five years in the cellar.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Sour fruit, funky root beer, dried salami and asphalt aromas show on the nose of this rustic bottling. Dried fruit and espresso flavors mark the palate.",US-California:Red Blend
"A Chardonnay of heightened acidity, this is fresh, light and banced, with tastes of lemon and pear.",US-California:Chardonnay

"Definitely sweet, this soft, red fruit flavored rosé has enough crispness to stop it being cloying. It is fruity and ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley:Rosé

"The most aromatically complex of the FE 2012 Rieslings, the Poison Hill offers beguiling scents of tangerine sherbet and Earl Grey tea. It's almost too perfumy for its soft, medium-bodied structure and slightly dusty-textured finish, but those floral elements are also its appeal. Drink now–2020+.",Australia-Western Australia:Riesling
"This ripe, fruity wine has soft tannins and a generous, warm character that makes it already drinkable. Better, however, to wait until its full potential is realized, from 2019.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

Flavors of savory oak and baked berry fruits are spicy, earthy and dry on the finish. Drink through 2021.",Spain-Levante:Red Blend

"Initially, this rosé made from free-run Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon juice smells sulfuric and gaseous, but with time it turns more plump and fruity. This is blocky and chunky on the palate, with yeasty, wheaty plum flavors. A scattered, bitter tasting finish with mustard notes closes it out.",Spain-Northern Spain:Rosado
"High Valley is a high elevation, volcanically shaped bowl in Lake County. This Rhône blend is slightly sweet and softly tannic, with ripe, savory flavors of raspberries, cherries, pepper and candied ginger. Drink now.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"A bold, candy cherry pink shade, this carries crisp apple flavors into a bone dry, rather tart middle. It's young and still pulling itself together, but chill it down and it should liven up a mid-summer deck party.",US-Oregon:Rosé
"This is a light, bright Chardonnay that would be a great wine to serve at casual dining situations or at larger gatherings. The finish bears an acidic kick",US-California:Chardonnay
"This is a new kitchen-sink offering from Banfi, featuring Cabernet, Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah. It goes full bore on the red fruit and oak, with spicy berry aromas and cherry flavors. The tannins are pretty hard, and with ample acids, this young wine currently starches the cheeks. But in three years it should become a good to very good table wine.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"There are dashes of exotic spice and ash that permeate into the lavish stonefruit and waxy flower notes on the nose and palate. This is complex and intensely juicy; the brisk acidity and crushed gravel notes add a clean, minerally edge.",Germany-Rheingau:Riesling
"This wine doesn't seem to have fully ripened. Aromas that veer into the green compete with coffee, plum and woodspice. It's light and soft but concentrated in flavor, making up for any aromatic deficiencies.",US-Washington:Malbec
"A drop of Viognier brings a floral, citrusy flair to this wine's rich orange, apricot and oak flavors. It's rich on the palate with a sweet vanillin character.",US-California:Roussanne
"Zesty orange rind and apple notes take center stage in this unoaked Chardonnay, unadorned by trimmings of wood or spice. Full bodied and ripe, its easygoing style is approachable. Soft acidity marks a plush, slightly clingy finish. Drink now through 2019.",US-New York:Chardonnay
"Bing cherry, blackberry and hot black lava rock aromas arise on the nose of this expression of a dry-farmed vineyard. The palate is light compared to similar Zins, showing plum skins, tomato leaf and a heightened sense of minerality along with cherry-candy flavors.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Meandering streaks of mineral oil and petrol hint at the developing maturity of this otherwise sunny, tangerine-scented Riesling. Dry in style, with a lush, expansive mouthfeel, it's balanced by a crush of wet stones and bitter white-tea notes on the finish. It's an elegant, complex wine to enjoy now through at least 2020.",Germany-Rheinhessen:Riesling
"Produced at a Domaine that is run by the Arnoux family, the wine has both a rich side and a firm side. The rich side is expressed in the bold red fruits, while the firm side comes through in the tannins and structure that will allow the wine to age. Drink this dense wine from 2020.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Tasted blind alongside the 2005 and 2010 vintages, this bottling, which is Chad Melville's first for his family winery after years focused on the vineyard, carries the same persistent sizzle of acidity on the front of the sip. But it's fresher on the nose, with pear juice, lychee and vanilla dust, and more approachable on the tropical palate, where jasmine, exotic banana, papaya, plumeria and a touch of guava shine.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Under control on the bouquet, this has pear and apple aromas. The wine feels round, juicy and pure, with oak, toast, lemon, apple and spice flavors. Barrel influence creates a peppery, dry and spicy finish, and overall this blend of Viura and Malvasia is on the money. Drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain:White Blend
"Sticky, puckering tannins wake up the palate and grab it for a wild ride in this reserve-level wine, which is densely ripe and burly in blackberry and tar.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Big tannins support the layers of extracted, concentrated fruit that leans red into cherry, cassis and currant. Char and vanilla speak for the oak.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Merlot and Cabernet Franc make up the majority of this blend. The aromas of dried herbs, pencil lead, cherry and spice are subdued while the palate brings a somewhat elegant style, with the tannins seeming a bit bunched up.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Notes of green apple cores; rich, savory yeast and peppery, pungent herbs characterize nose and palate. There is verve here and tons of flavor, the crispness of the vintage is beautifully countered by rounded yeastiness—but that backbone of structure and acidity shines and guarantees a long life for this wine—even though it will be difficult not to drink it now.",Austria-Weinviertel:Grüner Veltliner
"Chapel Hill's recent Cabernets have been impressive, and the 2006 continues that streak, offering complex aromas of green coffee beans, dried herbs and cassis, then easing into flavors of dark chocolate and black olive. Shows good density and richness, ending on notes of cofee and chocolate. Drink now–2013.",Australia-South Australia:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made with 80% Pinot Nero and 20% Chardonnay, this sparkling rosé has bright aromas of rose, berry and spice. The palate shows bitter cherry on the front, with a note of toasted almond and mineral.",Italy-Lombardy:Sparkling Blend
"With no time spent in oak, this bright, simple Sauvignon Blanc has pear, grapefruit and gooseberry notes and a quick finish.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Macho grapy aromas are offset by spunky raspberry scents. Fruity and a bit narrow and grabby across the palate, this delivers Mendoza's patented black-fruit flavors wrapped in chocolaty oak. Spice and oak remain present on a full finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Delicious jammy red fruits are the hallmark of this ripe wine. It is still young although it has great fruitiness and a juicy black-currant character. The wine is open, generous and likely to be ready to drink from 2018.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"Dark spice, cherry, plum, prune and bitter chocolate characterize this Bolgheri blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and other varieties. The wine is soft, lush and generous on the close.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Tangerine and citrus aromas give the bouquet an orangey element, and there's a pinch of oak and tarragon in there as well. The palate has a mild, buttery texture and creamy flavors of peach and apple. Honeyed and creamy on the simple finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Chardonnay
"Angels is made from a majority of Merlot, the balance nearly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Black pepper, clove and a whiff of Dr Pepper give it a spiciness that's also fruity, while a softness of texture and medium body maintain approachability.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Mountain fruit is the key to understanding this 100% Cab. By that is meant a unique combination of firm, astringent tannins and fabulously concentrated blackberry and currant fruit that absolutely demands aging. It's obvious that the terroir these grapes come from needs an appellation other than Alexander Valley, for there's nothing soft or herbal going on here. Hold until 2010, then should develop through 2014, at least.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of toast, truffle, game, plum and underbrush lead the nose. The lively palate offers black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and baking spice alongside soft tannins. Drink through 2017.",Italy-Piedmont:Barbera
"Quite a steal of a deal for a widely available wine, this shows cinnamon, red cherry, ripe cranberry, light tobacco and a touch of leather on the rustic nose. Once sipped, the mouthfeel is soft, offering flavors of cranberry and red cherry that are spiced by thyme, bay leaf and more cinnamon.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Tannic and dry, it's one tough wine, stinging the gums. But it has plenty of ripe blackberry, coffee, pepper and toasty flavors, and should age well. Hold onto it until 2019.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"Marginally better than the regular Chardonnay, this offers thin flavors of sour apple in a wash of acidity.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"86-88 Fine fruit, lovely black currant character, with fine acidity and great freshness. A delicious wine. There is some Carmenère in the blend.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Blackberry, blueberry, rubber and violet aromas show a pinch of cool-vintage green. The palate on this Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère-Petit Verdot-Syrah blend is tightly wound, with grating tannins. The berry flavors are a touch leafy, while the finish brings red fruit flavors and a touch of carob. Drink through 2018.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley:Red Blend
"Spicy plum and olive aromas get this tannic, wiry Cab going. It also offers mild green notes on the nose along with hard tannins. Spice, plum, vanilla and herbal flavors carry the finish.",Chile-Central Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a soft pretty wine with a light fruity character. It is gently fruity, finishing with a peppery edge and crisp acidity. Drink now.",France-Provence:Rosé
"Clean on the nose, with pure citrus and minerality. It's full but not heavy in the mouth, with developed, mature flavors of grapefruit and other citrus fruits. Mildly pithy, green and long on the finish. Not a prima ballerina; this has force and strength along with elegance.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a pleasant white wine, albeit rather generic, as Pinot Blanc is prone to be. Crisp apple flavors and a touch of grapefruit are the focus. Drink chilled and enjoy it while it's still young and fresh.",US-Oregon:Pinot Blanc
"Soft and ripe green pears play on nose and palate where that textural, phenolic mouthfeel is the main feature, suggesting that this belongs firmly on the table.",Austria-Kremstal:Grüner Veltliner
"The ripest and strongest of the Lodi Native wines this year, this has raspberry and black pepper aromas tinged with dusty, earthy accents, and heavy flavors like stewed plums.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Ripe bramble, crisp strawberry and cherry perfume this full-bodied moderately concentrated rosé. Dry in style, it's easy drinking with a slightly candied cherry-cough-drop finish.",US-New York:Rosé
"An aromatic, seductive wine, scented with smoke and chocolate, cedar and strawberry. Thick and chewy, with ripe raspberry fruit and a liquorous, barrel-inflected finish. This is a big wine for those who like sheer power, in both fruit and tannins.",US-Washington:Merlot
"This barrel-fermented wine has opulent aromas of nougat, butterscotch and pear tart. Equally interesting flavors stress the spice and pastry notes rather than straightforward fruitiness. It is attractively rich in mouth feel, dry, full-bodied and grand in style.",US-California:Chardonnay
"The aromas of pear, chrysanthemum and star fruit are followed by lighter-styled flavors that display a sense of elegance.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"Bright and fruity, this Sangiovese offers aromas of wild berry, clove and tilled soil. The easy-drinking palate doles out dark cherry, raspberry, white pepper and a hint of crushed mint alongside polished tannins. Enjoy through 2016.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Although this Pinot is captivatingly rich in raspberry and cherry pie filling, red currant and Dr. Pepper cola flavors, it also has fine acidity and smooth, complex tannins, and a lovely overlay of sweet, smoky oak. Good as it is, there's no reason why it shouldn't develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This conveys a heady mix of luscious French oak, butter and toast, plus roasted nuts, a dash of Cognac, orange oil, apple sauce and baked pear. This thrilling wine is the first Chardonnay from Trisaetum. It reflects the growing partnership between winemaker James Frey and Jacques Lardière formerly from Jadot.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"An immediately attractive, quaffable wine with clean, fresh flavors. This is a light, fresh wine designed to go with summer foods.",Italy-Veneto:White Blend
"Smashed berry aromas are backed by earth and toasty oak notes. Fairly hard and tannic on the palate, this shows herbal plum flavors in front of a bold finish with dry tannins and a hint of wood spice.",Argentina-Other:Malbec
"This rich offering from central Italy opens with a pretty floral fragrance of iris and lilac, along with notes of espresso and toast. The palate is soft and round, with ripe plum, blackberry, coffee, vanilla and a dusting of cocoa.",Italy-Central Italy:Montepulciano
"This has a unique nose, including notes of clover and pine. The palate has a dark, hard, tannic core, with hints of black cherry and bitter chocolate peeing through. It may need several more years to open up completely.",US-Oregon:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A new wine from La Clarine Farm, this is a blend of 37% Sémillon, 32% Viognier and 31% Marsanne. Unusual to say the least, it bears an interesting melange of herbs, flowers, pears and honey, finishing light and inviting to drink. The minerality in particular shines through, making this easy to pair with a wide range of appetizers and seafood.",US-California:White Blend
"Very soft gentle floral hints of honeysuckle rise from the glass. The dry palate amplifies them with peachy fruit on a slender, taut and textured palate. There is a lightness in the step and lovely depth of aromas with a touch of lavender on the finish.",France-Alsace:Muscat
"One of the Talley family's more affordable bottlings, this is a great choice for weeknight sipping or bringing to neighborhood parties. Aromas of dried cherries meet with forest floor, wet thyme and chipped slate on the nose, while the palate offers light cran-raspberry, dried herbs and a menthol finish on a decently acidic structure.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"While this is stout and dark up front, the nose comes with a note of stewed fruit. The thick, tannic palate is grabby and resiny in feel, while flavors of raw oak taste lactic, and the berry fruit component in the wine is loamy and feels big and blocky.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Warm, lightly baked aromas of plum, cherry and dust set up a layered palate with just enough acidity to keep this wine upright and steady. Flavors of loamy berry, earth and chocolate are rich, while the finish tastes oaky, with more than enough vanilla and toast. Drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"Even and light, but with copious tart cherry aromas and flavors, this tasty red comes from rugged Extremedura, in southwestern Spain, near Portugal. Saddle leather accents add interest, and the tangy finish closes with balanced tannins that'll cut through food well. Drink now–2005. —M.M.",Spain-Central Spain:Tempranillo
"Inky dark and compressed, this is a concentrated expression of juicy black fruit and licorice. With sizable, powerful tannin, it needs time to decompress, a leathery texture requiring patience to soften. Cellar through 2020.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Here is a raw, chewy and vinous expression of Dolcetto with loads of bright berry and fruit intensity. The wine is easy and fresh with dense pulp and texture on the close.",Italy-Piedmont:Dolcetto
"La Togata offers a crisp and fresh Rosso, with aromas of bright berry, cherry cola, wild raspberry and lemon zest. The natural acidity of this wine would pair well with lasagna topped with melted mozzarella and Parmigiano.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Cherry and berry aromas are a bit hot and saucy. This feels chunky and borderline sticky, with hard raspberry and plum flavors. This is marginal, even for basic commercial Cabernet.",Chile-Curicó Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Not one of the generally declared vintages for Port, this year produced some ripe, sweet single quinta vintages. It also was a good year for rich, sweet tawnies. This is ripe, toffee-like in character packed with ripe raisin and sultana flavors. It is a luxurious wine, of course ready to drink.",Portugal-Port:Port
"A 50/50 blend of wood-aged Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon from selected wines. It is wood-dominated at present, but the fruit feels rich enough to come through shortly, and then it will be an impressively ripe, structured wine. However, it's always going to be a dry, dark and firmly tannic.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of scorched earth, game and a whiff of farmyard lead the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry, leather, anise and sage alongside bracing but fleeting tannins. It finishes abruptly, leaving a rather astringent close.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Owner-winemaker Tod Dexter and his wife Debbie planted their first vines in 1987, making them reasonably mature for the region. The result is a medium-bodied restrained yet silky and seductive Pinot Noir. Black cherry, cola, cedar and spice elements combine easily on the nose and palate, then linger elegantly on the finish. Drink now–2020.",Australia-Victoria:Pinot Noir
"Offers rich, concentrated fruit with lovely apple and cream flavors, a touch of vanilla and superripe fruit. The aftertaste has a touch of acidity, but richness rather than acidity is what this wine is about.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Bianco
"Proof again from Pierre Luneau that Muscadet can age. This wine, 11 years old, still tastes fresh. The only concession to age is the loss of the high green primary fruits, but the flavors have then rounded out, still creamy, still full of vivacious acidity, but now with almonds, some toast and ripeness.",France-Loire Valley:Melon
"This young Chardonnay still shows plenty of yeasty scents and flavors, turning it almost beer-like. Light lemon and tea flavors, with a dash of baking spices, complete the picture.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"This blend of 51% Syrah, 32% Mourvèdre and 17% Grenache shows root beer, smoked black cherries, dark chocolate and sweet tar on the nose. The palate is powered by dried red fruits, more smoke and a dusty character.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"From one of Tuscany's most celebrated wine areas, this luscious wine is soft, beautifully textured and plush. It shows ripe red fruit, plus leather, tobacco, sweet cinnamon and marzipan on the bouquet.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"This Zin wants two or three years to round off the jagged edges. There's a lot going on, from the supple blackberry, leather and pepper flavors, wildly exotic spices and smooth tannins to an undefinable earthy-mineral taste that must come from the soil. There's some burn from alcohol, as Zins from the Maple Vineyards tend to exhibit.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Smooth and fruity, this all-stainless effort carries a citrusy tang into the finish. It quickly settles into a good flavor groove, with suggestions of fresh-baked bread.",US-Oregon:Pinot Gris
"So elegant, a wine with just a fine balance. It has creamy apple fruit flavors, hedgerow fruits, with a line of crisp acidity to cut through the fruitiness and give a more mineral edge. It will be worth aging this wine for 2–3 years. Drink after 2014.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"Cusumano is a terrific Sicilian estate that offers both high-end expressions and a consistent line of value wines. This well-priced Nero d'Avola is fresh, clear, fruit-forward and easy to drink.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nero d'Avola
"This 100% varietal wine is spicy and succulent, with a touch of oak reduction on the nose that resolves as it opens. Big boned, it tastes dark cherry- and plum-driven, spiked with cinnamon and black pepper.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Bright and wound up tight, this single-vineyard entry offers nicely-focused raspberry and cherry fruit. Brief barrel aging has added a touch of chocolate around the tannins.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Good price for a rich, textured Syrah. Shows delicious cherry, black raspberry, chocolate, anise, pepper and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Drink this soft, fruity Syrah now.",US-California:Syrah
"From selected grapes, this is a powerful, complex wine. It has huge richness, tasting of the Alentejo sun. At the same time, the fruit is firm and structured, slowly revealing its fresher berry character to balance the density. The delicious juicy aftertaste promises a fine future for this wine. Drink from 2016.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"A very light shade of straw in the glass, this shows distinct honey, beeswax and mead notes on the delicate nose. The flavors float on a cloud of more honey, drizzled atop Key lime pie, with vanilla syrup popping up on the finish.",US-California:Viognier
"Nondescript in aroma, this soft Cabernet Franc offers pronounced tannins and a taste of red currant.",US-California:Cabernet Franc
"Cloudy to the eye, with overly green aromas of tomato and bell pepper, along with spice and dried cherry. Feels hot and acidic, with a clipped, cutting palate full of berry flavors, herbs and green pepper. Fresh but herbal on the finish.",Argentina-Other:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Generous, rich and ripe, this boasts black fruits and sweet tannins. With layers of new wood, this is a wine that shows attractive fruitiness now and has considerable aging ability.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Bramble, wet slate, nori, red spice and a smoky, iodine-like element show on the nose of this bottling. The palate offers dried red fruit and a gamy quality, dashed with oregano, marjoram and a cigar-like spice.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Forward and fruity yet balanced and composed, this bold red blend is made from a kitchen's sink blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Syrah. Luscious black-cherry and plum flavors are ripe but keep a shade short of jammy and are highlighted by a bright vein of acidity. Bold, dense tannins on the finish should meld nicely by 2020.",US-New York:Red Blend
"Robust and fruity, this big Syrah floods the mouth with blackberries, currants, bacon and black pepper. It's a delicious wine, wrapped into firm tannins, and ideal with a nice charbroiled steak, with salt and pepper to echo the wine's spices.",US-California:Syrah
"Ripe and powerfully structured, this is dense with bold blackberry flavors and dark tannins that give a firm structure. However, as so often with 2013, it's the fruit that shines in this rich wine. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Light fresh aromas and flavors along with decent balance make this wine a versatile drink. The flavors are faint but clean, so it makes a good palate cleanser and should work well for a crowd.",US-California:Pinot Grigio
"Aragonez is the main force behind this smooth, rich wine. It has great tannins that are cushioned comfortably by the rich, juicy berry fruits. Spice and acidity roll around the mouth, giving a lift to the rich, still firmly tannic wine. Drink this impressive wine from 2018.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"Trim and tannic, this distinctive effort mixes bright black cherry and cassis fruit with peppery herbs, notably rosemary. The balance is right on track, and the wine holds together through a medium-long finish.",US-Oregon:Merlot
"There is a racy, spicy, biting edge to this young Pinot that nicely expresses the Chehalem Mountains AVA terroir, authoritative and unapologetic for the herbal side of the grape. It lingers and opens into a mélange of red fruits, forest, leaf and loam, still stiff and compact after hours of breathing.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This has a bright salmon color, vivid apple and ripe peach aromas and a soft, mouthfilling texture. Rich, slightly sweet flavors blend savory, almost salty accents with fruit on the way to a soft finish.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"This limited reserve incorporates the best of 82 different lots, some done in stainless steel, some in neutral oak, and some in concrete eggs. Phenomenal concentration reveals a wine packed with powerful fruit flavors that cover the spectrum of citrus, apple, peach and pear. The luscious combination is supported with natural acidity and an underlying minerality. It's deep, long and satisfying, with the structure to age for decades.",US-Oregon:Riesling
"Exotic spice, stone fruit and orange rind tones perfume this aromatic dry Riesling. Full bodied and lusciously textured, it gains a cutting, linear feel on the midpalate from staccato strikes of lime pith and lemony acidity. It's a finely poised wine with dramatic complexity that's likely to evolve well through 2025.",Germany-Rheingau:Riesling
"Shows the classic structure of Oakville, with impeccably ripe tannins, and the winemaker's touch of oak is deft. The black currant flavors could use a bit more concentration, though, as there's a stubborn thinness throughout.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Black fruit aromas feature a touch of licorice. Feels lively and alert, with edgy acids and juicy, forward flavors of plum and wild berry. Toasty, integrated and spicy on the finish, with pinches of green and black pepper.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"This opens with sensations of underbrush, tobacco, espresso and toasted notes. The extracted palate displays stewed fruit sensations, oak, vanilla, roasted coffee bean and searing alcohol. It's already evolved and ends on an almost sugary-sweet note.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"At the age of five-plus, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc is showing some mileage. It's losing freshness, with dried pineapple, apricot and peach flavors emerging, and an edge of cashews and dried herbs. Yet it remains lively and clean. If you're unfamiliar with an older Sauvignon Blanc, try it. Fully ready now.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"There is just a touch of smokiness in this rich, full wine that's definitely made for food. There are red plums, some tannic texture as well as citrus and final crisp, fresh acidity.",France-Provence:Rosé
"This is a heartbeat or two from being DOA. Tan in color with an oily heavy mouthfeel, this tastes oxidized and shows almost no pulse.",Spain-Northern Spain:Verdejo
Honeyed ripe pear fruit fills the nose. The palate amplifies this rich notion even more with a generous touch of residual sweetness that bathes the pear fruit in caramel richness. There is a glint of pleasant phenolic bitterness here and there but the pear fruit conquers all. This is rich but fresh with a medium-sweet finish ideal for blue cheese.,France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"Earth, leather, black plum and wild-berry aromas are solid and appealing. This is wide and jammy in the mouth, with all the volume expected of Argentinean Malbec. Flavors of oak, mint and spiced plum finish with a touch of heat. Drink through 2018.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"One of the most popular mutt reds, this no-holds-barred blend  offers plenty of ripe fruit, nice chocolaty tannins, and it's a full, forward, well-balanced wine that has some genuine muscle behind it. There are notes of licorice and iron, hints of smoke and earth, all well integrated and complete.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"A vivid gold color and spice-rack aromas like nutmeg and cardamom add a different twist to this medium-bodied and rather rich-textured wine. Those are probably characteristics from aging with oak, and they enhance the clean, fresh fruit flavors in a good way.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Soft notes of blossom and apricot strike a gentle tone in this wine, with hints of ripe, juicy apple on the dry but wonderfully aromatic palate. The more you sip, the more nuances appear: nettle, grapefruit peel, white currant and peach. It offers a sprightly and weightless body despite the flavor concentration, celebrating full-flavored purity.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"Yeasty savoriness on the nose conjures up salty hints of miso and soy, alluringly so. The palate is even more salty and expressive, with waves of tingling white pepper. The fruit that lurks through is of green Conference pear and more greenish savor: think nettle and lovage, even watercress. A lemony fillip provides a fresh backbone. What a joy to drink. Lovely now but built to last. Drink 2017–2025.",Austria-Kamptal:Grüner Veltliner
"This is a rich, succulent wine, more akin to an auslese than a true spätlese. Dried apricot and orange marmalade aromas and flavors surround a core of dried spices and crushed stone, finishing on a spicy, mineral note. Drink now–2025.",Germany-Rheingau:Riesling
"A smoky oak fire meets cooked meats and plum sauce on the nose of this wine, which retains great balance even at 16% alcohol.

"Balanced and ripe, this is a rich wine. Its tannins and dark chocolate and wood flavors are deliciously balanced by ripe black fruit. It's concentrated and dense and will age well. Drink from 2021.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"There's a unique note here of mature fruit, chopped basil or peppermint with a hint of spice or chopped white peppercorn. The bubbling seems less frothy and the wine has a flat, big feel in the mouth. Grapes were farmed organically and the wine is from the 2007 vintage, which may explain its distinctive style.",Italy-Veneto:Prosecco
"From parcels in the southern portion of Clos Vougeot, Bichot produces a ripe, relatively soft style of wine. It is, of course, also rich and powerful, but the tannins are sweet, subdued into ripe red plum and raspberry fruits, the acidity giving the wine a fresh, lively character to finish.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"The most aged of the Palmas series, Cuatro displays powerful, almost fiery aromas of caramel and briny stone fruits.

Of all the Palmas wines, this is the one that shows afterburners.",Spain-Andalucia:Sherry
"Enticing aromas of tropical fruit, elderflower, tomato leaf and a whiff of hay lead the nose on this full-bodied white. The savory palate offers juicy honeydew melon, creamy white peach, passion fruit, chopped herb and mineral. Fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon
"There's a fine Pinot Noir in the bottle, but it needs a little time to come around. Tasted in the Fall of 2008, it was a bit hard in tannins, which masked the fruit. But there's a polished core of wild blackberries, cherries, cola and red plums that suggest aging through 2009, if you can keep your hands off it.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Spicy, floral and with a touch of minerality, this is poised and layered. It's dense and honeyed on the palate but overall, has a balanced, attractive character. Imported by Bayfield Importing, Ltd.",Canada-Ontario:Riesling
"This leads with herb, vanilla and plum aromas, along with a reduced note of tire rubber. On the palate, sweet plum flavors are backed by gritty tannins, proving somewhat disjointed.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A nicely made and easy to like kind of young Ribera red with clean, bold blackberry aromas and flavors that fit the wine's big, tannic structure. Composed on the back palate and beefy on the finish. Perfect for grilled meats. Drink now through 2012.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo

"This Randall Grahm wine, which also includes 9% Mourvèdre and 2% Syrah, hits the nose with tight raspberry juice, hibiscus, cola and iron aromas, proving tight and mineral-driven. Pencil lead leads the lighter palate, which also shows brisk pomegranate, black and white pepper and a menthol-like Sichuan-peppercorn sensation on the finish. It's a tremendous wine for the price.",US-California:Grenache

"A struck-flint note on the nose gives this wine a touch of fumé character, and the familiar tropical fruit and overt green notes seem reined-in for this vintage.

"Obviously from a superior terroir, this Pinot shows gorgeously ripe berry fruit and spices, brisk acidity, firm tannins and a rich coating of oak. But the parts haven't come together. It's like a team that needs practice. Should peak sometime in 2012, and hold for a couple years.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Hailing from an emerging region northeast of Napa Valley, this SB is heavily oaked, and thus features big batches of butter and toast. Yellow apples and cantaloupe flavors are barely detectable under the veneer of thick oak. It's surely full-bodied, bordering on over the top. But it has positive qualities, including a rich and pleasant mouthfeel.",US-California:Fumé Blanc

"This workhorse vineyard supplies grapes to a wide variety of wines across the entire Ste. Michelle portfolio, but the vineyard-designated wines are much more limited, and they're often the best of show. As the alcohol reaches 15.5%, this selection is sappy, dense and a bit warm.

"While impressive now for its weight and flavor profile, this should evolve well, thanks to its heavy tannins and ample concentration. Right now, there is wet earth and prominent mint on the nose.

Expect a racy wine with dynamic pineapple and grapefruit as its cornerstones.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"This fairly limited release remains sturdy and tight, with flavors stacked impressively. Deep cherry kirsch fruit is at the core, with streaks of cola and sassafras. As the wine breathes, it gains both flesh and momentum, moving into a long and delicious finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Among Genium's fine lineup of 2010 Priorat reds, this one stands out for it's schisty nose of cherry, currant and raspberry. A ripe, layered, chiseled palate is tough but rewarding.

"A nutty and acidic wine, with aromas of pressed walnuts and toffee. Feels tight, sharp and narrow on the tongue, with blazing acidity and dry, limited, salty flavors that fold in toffee and sour fruit notes.

"A blend of seven different vineyards, the name is French for spoon. This is a softer, less tannic wine than most of the other Torii Mor 2005s, but is not quite what you would call silky. Mixed red fruits, light scents suggesting flower as well as berry, and a feminine elegance characterize this Pinot. It's been carefully crafted to emphasize the subtle herbs and spices, without hiding behind the more obvious flavors of new oak.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir

"Earns points for sheer size, a powerhouse of concentrated, intense blackberry and cassis flavors, liberally coated with oak.

"Simple and Porty, with baked berry flavors that finish sharp and astringent.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Bright raspberry aromas are cut by a slightly funky touch of composting violets, dried bay leaf and animal hide on this deeply layered bottling from the legendary producer.

Those flavors also add to the overall finesse and silkiness of the finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso

"Blueberry fruit, purple flowers and licorice break through the very dense cloud of finely knit tannins that frame the entire experience of this best-of-house bottling.

The aromas of guava and other tropical fruits are faint while the flavors seem washed out. There's enjoyment to be had but it all needs to be dialed up.,US-Washington:Chardonnay
"While not as blossomy in perfume as previous vintages, there's plenty of fresh watermelon and sour-cherry refreshment here. Exceptionally light bodied and dry, it's an invigoratingly crisp summer sip. The finish is brisk but crystalline and mineral.",US-New York:Rosé
"From the winery's Annapolis Vineyard, at the cool, northern tip of the “true” Sonoma Coast, comes this chunky young Pinot Noir. Although the grapes were destemmed before fermentation, the tannins are significant, a reflection of the low yields and tough skins the berries develop. In fact, the wine is almost Zinny in its full body and spicy, briary fruit. It clearly needs time. Best after 2011.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"From the large Beaulieu estate near Aix-en-Provence, this wine shows great fruitiness as well as a mineral texture and good depth. Ripe raspberry and red currant fruits are laced with acidity. It's very much a food rosé.",France-Provence:Rosé
"Smashed berries, honeyed coffee, leather, beef jerky, cola and black pepper show on the nose of this complex wine by the legendary Hearst family. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with lightly roasted coffee notes, touches of seared caramel, sesame oil and teriyaki and a base of dried black-plum fruit.",US-California:Malbec
"Here's a nice Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now. It shows how well this variety grows in the warmer parts of the county, with citrus, apricot, peach and spice flavors. Crisp acidity provides zesty balance to this deliciously drinkable young wine.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Jammy, creamy and superripe, with raspberry, burnt toast and coffee on the thick, meaty nose. Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine. It pushes the envelope on ripeness, but that's become the Cirsion way. An awesome wine that deserves a proper decanting.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Aromas of plum, wild herbs and tobacco are mature and suggest that this is ready to drink. In the mouth, this is medium-bodied, with clarity and a sense of freshness. Plum, berry and cherry flavors finish in harmony. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"There are people out there who will love this big, blustery Cab, with its powerful fruit and oak, its bacon fat reminiscent of other high-octane reds under the Earthquake label. And there are those who will not like this wine at all, the alcohol all that will register and remain. This wine does not tread lightly.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of yellow melon and flowers form the core of the bouquet, with additional hints of straw and grapefruit peel in the background. The light-weight palate offers good balance, with rich tropical-fruit tones of pineapple and mango that finish clean and mouthwatering.",France-France Other:White Blend
"Redolent of fresh citrus, peach, pear and fragrant white flower, this is a wine to drink on a hot summer day by the pool.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Grigio
"The second wine of the Bruno Prats and Symington family joint venture, this is a deliciously fruity wine, but with a fine elegant backbone of light tannins and smoky wood. As befits a second wine in the Bordeaux tradition, this is ready to drink.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"Unripe, with strong lemongrass, green pea and feline spray flavors accompanying more pleasant lemons and limes. Acidity is strong, and the wine is totally dry.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"A lovely, heady lift of lemon, peach and passion fruit dances on the nose. This rich sweet-fruited tropicality is played out fully on the medium-sweet palate where the passion fruit swirls tartly alongside sweet ripe generous peach. It is the passion-fruit aroma and tartness that gives this a real edge. This not only has sweetness but a real tropical thrill. It's a very concentrated, pure-fruited wine with lots of promise. Drink 2017–2027.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"This is a very powerful Chardonnay, brimming in guava, golden mango, white peach, pear and Key lime pie flavors, to which smoky oak adds even richer layers of butterscotch and caramel. A crisp edge of peppery acidity provides a clean, zesty balance to this enormous wine.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This big but harmonious wine made from white Rhône grape varieties pulls off the fully oaked style very well, starting with its buttered baguette aroma and continuing on the palate with baked apple and ripe pear flavors and smooth, creamy texture. It has a wonderful, lingering finish too.",US-California:White Blend
"This luminous, hay-colored Grillo imparts measured notes of banana and exotic fruit that add extra richness and dimension to what is a simple and easy-drinking white wine overall. You could pair this wine with a long list of seafood, vegetable and pasta recipes—and you can't beat this low price.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Grillo
"Hello alcohol and black cherry liqueur. A nicely made and compelling Syrah this is, although the alcohol is intense. The wine has mighty tannins and is very fruity, with an added note of black licorice. The peppery finish will make you want more.",US-California:Syrah
"From producers Ambrogio & Giovanni Folonari, Baia al Vento (90% Merlot with small percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot) shows ripe fruit, plum, blackberry preserves and cherry backed by cured meat, tobacco and dried rosemary. The wine is round and soft with bright points of acidity that keeps it balanced.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"This is lightly structured, showing balanced red berry fruits and round tannins. For a 2010, it is softening fast; this should be drinkable in the next six months.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"A distinct green streak shines throughout this wine, with aromas of green bean and plantain and flavors of grass and pepper. Light weight but a bit round in the mouth, with a medium-length finish.",South Africa-Stellenbosch:Sauvignon Blanc
"With its onion-skin color, this already shows age. The palate, with its mature reflection and beautiful rounded texture, confirms this. Rich, well balanced and gently mature, it has retained enough red fruits to keep an element of freshness. It is a food wine, rich and full in the mouth.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Thirty bucks may seem like a lot for an entry-level Riesling, but this is an exemplary example. Aromas of wet stones, moss and spring flowers are mouthwatering, and then are followed by a complex array of nonfruity flavors, like stones and greens carried along by a mouthfeel that's light as a feather. Tart pineapple emerges on the long finish. Drink anytime over the next 10 years.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"While the winery's regular 2010 Diamond Mountain Cab is a barrel selection, this Estate Vineyard selection consists of “only the darkest, most extracted lots,” from the winery's various vineyards, according to the winemaker. That's exactly what you get, an inky wine, it's huge on the palate with blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, augmented by plenty of new French oak. It is absolutely delicious now, but the tannin structure guarantees to develop for 10–20 years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A standout among New York Pinot Noirs, Lakewood's offering escapes the excessive acidity trap and offers a well-structured palate framed by chewy tannins. The palate shows flavors of strawberries but is too dense at this point to yield much complexity; a few years in the bottle should solve this problem. Drink with roasted duck or quail.",US-New York:Pinot Noir
"This is actually a 2010 wine, but for consistency it is not labeled with the vintage. Fragrant and floral, with the addition of 5% Riesling contributing a pleasing orange blossom/orange peel accent. Overall, it's refreshing and succulent, a juicy mix of citrus fruits and balanced acids.",US-Washington:Sauvignon Blanc
"Coconut and vanilla aromas are squarely in the lead, but the nose's berry base is more than solid. Plump, round and showing good overall balance, with flavors of cola, dark fruit and coconut. A ripe, bulky crianza with plenty of leftover oak on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"An atypical offering, this full-bodied Riesling possessing a slightly oily texture is saturated with a creamy butteryness and earthy essences such as mushroom and truffle. While hints of white peach might surface in the mouth, it is surprisingly easy to take pleasure in its other slightly odd and unexpected characteristics.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"Named after Léonie Duchêne, one of the founders of the company, this is a toasty bottling. It has an onion-skin pink color and delicate aromas of red fruits which show on the palate, along with a crisp and dry acidity. Ready to drink.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Some appealing floral highlights rub against flavors of orange crush, cherry soda and toasted cracker. This young wine seems structured for early drinking.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This tiny winery burst on the scene when its 2010 Cabernet scooped three trophies at the Margaret River Wine Show. This wine does show more weight and richness than the 2012, with a silky, satiny texture rarely found in young Cabernet Sauvignon and crisp, cassis-inflected fruit. Drink now–2030.",Australia-Western Australia:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is in the “velvet” school of red blends, showing a very supple, rich texture and a definite level of sweetness to soften the overall impact. It has sweet-seeming aromas like maple syrup and blackberry jam, and ripe fruits on the palate too.",US-America:Red Blend
"A blend of the two Cabernets and Merlot, the '04 Trilogy shows the wine's traditional elegance. The flavors are extremely ripe, suggesting blackberries, cherries and cocoa, with a sugared finish. Fully drinkable now due to the softness of the tannins.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Alluring Nebbiolo aromas of dark berry, purple flower, baking spice, truffle and herb slowly unfold in this wine. The savory, succulent palate doles out Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, cinnamon and licorice flavors against a backdrop of firm, refined tannins and bright acidity.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"This offers the classic Nebbiolo fragrance of blue flower, red rose, woodland berry, tilled earth and whiffs of cake spices. The palate delivers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry and white pepper framed in big, chewy tannins.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"The vineyard has been a Zinfandel source to St. Francis, as well as other wineries, for years, but this is St. Francis's best in a decade. The wine is fantastically concentrated in dried blackberry, blueberry, dark unsweetened chocolate, tobacco and elaborate spice flavors. Defines complexity in Zinfandel, although the very high alcohol will bother some people.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This wine by winemaker Fintan du Fresne shows sea salt, apple blossom, cherimoya and tangerine rinds on the nose. Flavors are clean and pure, with dried apple, more sea salt, a bit of nectarine and orange spritz, offering a profile that could comfortably rest on the tongue all day long.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Char, firepit, barrel spice and herb aromas lead to elegantly styled cranberry flavors in this wine. The tannins lend a light structure.",US-Washington:Syrah
"A bright salmon color, this playful selection is bright and easy drinking. Aromas and flavors of melon rind, sweet pea, red cherry and cranberry fill the nose and mouth, with bright acidity that keeps the palate fresh and the finish clean.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon:Rosé
"With its firm tannins and structure, this is a wine that's made in the traditional Nuits-St.-Georges style. But it's also packed with ripe red fruit, and it has a jammy character and an open feel. There is no doubt that this is a wine to age for at least five years.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
The wine shows considerable wood aging flavors as well as the sweet toffee and fruit flavors. The wood spice is too dominant and throws the rest of the wine out of balance.,Portugal-Port:Port
"Cartizze is the most celebrated vineyard cru in the Prosecco area and this expression lives up to its reputation very nicely. It offers delicate floral and mineral tones that create a smooth, feminine personality.",Italy-Veneto:Glera
"Warm, shimmering notes of ripe pear fill nose and palate. This generous fruit is countered by citric freshness on this dry, almost slender wine that pulls off a lovely balance and softness without losing its definition.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"Coming from a blend of top sites Red Willow and Forgotten Hills, this wine offers reserved aromas of berry, herb, smoked meat and pepper. The palate brings bright acid and intensity of flavor but with a sense of elegance that keeps you hanging on each sip.",US-Washington:Syrah
"This is a lush and okay expression, with forward notes of wood-grilled apple, buttered toast, caramel corn and honeydew on the nose and mouth. The mouthfeel is round and creamy, with ample acidity to cut the wine's weight and dense, rich flavors. Flavors of honeycomb and sweet spice hang on to the close. Drink now–2019.",South Africa-Coastal Region:Chenin Blanc
"Punset releases its wines much later than others and its organic, Nebbiolo-based wines really do need a lot of time in the bottle before they are ready to drink. Take this 2004 Barbaresco: The wine is very alive and bright with firm tannins and a long finish that will gain traction over the next decade.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"“Il Bugiardo,” which is Italian for “the liar,” is an honest and plump wine, with soft berry aromas that are woven into spicy notes of clove, black pepper, leather and tobacco. The finish is velvety and smooth.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"All stainless fermented, this seems to show some residual sugar, perhaps in order to round out the austere acidity. Lemon and tangerine fruit—all with plenty of acid—are annotated with highlights of fresh cilantro. It would be a fine match for simple, white fish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Gris
"Aromas of black-skinned berry, baking spice and tilled soil lead the nose on this straightforward wine. The juicy palate delivers red plum, clove and a touch of cinnamon alongside round tannins. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Central Italy:Sangiovese
"The deliciously tart notes of Cox Orange Pippin apples are heightened by lemon brightness. The palate shimmers with peach but zesty lemon keeps the upper hand in this concentrated, ripe but linear Riesling. The finish is just a little hot.",Austria-Wachau:Riesling
"Aromas suggest bright berry, underbrush, eucalyptus and a whiff of wet fur. The palate starts off strong, with bright red berry and grilled herb but then it falls off, leaving a somewhat hollow midpalate. Despite the lean character, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity make this very drinkable.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This is a structured wine that will shortly balance its blackberry fruit and tannins. It has fine acidity, and a core of dryness that will soften. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Barbera, Sangiovese, Grenache and Graziano are in the blend. The Sangiovese was crushed and fermented conventionally, then blended with grapes that had been air-dried. Results are mixed at the moment; the wine carries a whiff of burnt rubber that shortens the finish. Some pretty strawberry and cherry fruit peeks through, but that tarry finish needs further bottle age to open it up a bit.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Very fruity, this is a crisp, lemon-scented and flavored wine, with grassy, herbaceous character from the green Sauvignon Blanc in the blend. The aftertaste is tight with some bitterness.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Forest floor, flint, Alpine herb, sandalwood, leather and pressed rose are some of the scents you'll discover on this mountain Nebbiolo. The precise, radiant palate delivers dried red cherry, raspberry, white pepper, anise and tobacco. It's well balanced with firm refined tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2018–2026.",Italy-Lombardy:Nebbiolo
"A soft, luscious Zin, dry and firm in tannins, with forward flavors of raspberries, cherries, almond biscotti, mocha and dusty spices. Drink now.",US-California:Zinfandel
"The wine is full of juicy acidity along with some attractive spice and light wood flavors. It is still developing and the fruit is too young, so give it until 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A blend of 58% Sauvignon Blanc and 42% Gewürztraminer, this wine was given no oak aging and has a slight percentage of residual sugar. Peach colored, it's also flavorful in peach and apricot, simple and easy to like, with a slight spritz to the end.",US-California:White Blend
"This unoaked wine is tart and simple, with sweet and sour flavors of oranges and pineapples, like fruit juice with alcohol.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"This is one of the higher elevation premier crus in Puligny. In this warm vintage it has managed to give a wine that is crisp and mineral. To contrast with this, the wine also has a creamy, toasty character from the wood aging. Drink from 2021.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Soft, smooth and ripe, this wine has a sure-fire crowd-pleasing style. It's bursting with flavors of banana, papaya and pear, with just enough acidity to keep it from turning flabby. Put a little chill on it and drink soon.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"This is made in a very rich style, with lots of forward fruit, flavors of pears, citrus and citrus rind. Somehow the floral elegance of the variety is lost in all the ripe fruit.",US-Oregon:Viognier
"Ripe and sweet blackberry jam and dried fig flavors fill out this Port-style sweet wine. Good doses of tannin and acidity keep it structured enough to not feel cloying, lending a little textural grip.",US-California:Port
"Dark and intense in spicy blackberry, cherry, cocoa and earthy flavors with a hint of bitter espresso. The rich but smooth tannins and crisp acidity of this ripe wine cry out for beef or lamb.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This exceptional release is firm and focused, with lip-smacking acidity. Tart apple and tangy limeade pack the core flavors, underscored with wet-stone minerality.",US-Oregon:Pinot Gris
"Initial aromas of vanilla, cherry, and espresso yield to fresh black earth on the palate. It's medium-bodied and crisp, with the a good spread of well-tamed tannins. Medium, one-dimensional finish. Drink now.",US-New York:Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's a touch of playful sweetness as the bouquet begins to evolve in the glass, recalling sweet raspberry and wild blueberry. Behind those youthful tones are delicate layers of licorice, dried mint and dark vanilla. Still young, the tannins already show an evolution toward silkiness.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"This wine has potential, with ripe berry fruits and soft tannins that are already well integrated. It is dense, showing a structure that will broaden out as the wine ages. Drink this juicy, fruity wine from Vignobles Dulon from 2016.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Tight red fruit and a solid whack of oak make for a fine wine. Tobacco mingles with coffee on the otherwise black-cherry and curranty palate. It's definitely clean and polished, and will drink well for the next three to five years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Stalky, somewhat rubbery aromas of plum and berry come in front of the grabby, tannic, staunch palate, with baked, leathery flavors of plum and berry. While this tastes stalky on the finish, the feel is good.",Spain-Catalonia:Red Blend
"Scents of sweet-cream butter, vanilla and stonefruit are enticing on the nose of this richly textured, medium-bodied wine. The palate boasts hints of sweet lemon curd and fresh apple, but the slightly-sour oak notes can be overwhelming.",US-New York:Chardonnay
"Lush, rich, beguiling now. Tastes fat and unctuous, like a Pomerol despite being made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, offering a creamy wealth of cherries, currants, chocolate, anise, herbs, spices and smoky oak. For all the flamboyance, it's bone dry, with classically solid Napa tannins, courtesy of fruit from Oakville and Howell Mountain. Should develop in the bottle through 2018.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a solid Verdejo, with citrusy acidity and pulp to the palate. It shows modest melon and apple aromas and citrus and green herb flavors that finish with no major changes.",Spain-Central Spain:Verdejo
"A fresh, fruity, unoaked effort, this has lively acidity, with flavors of quince and pear and a soft, open texture. Screwcap.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"A complex blend of four grapes, this wine is rich, rounded and ripe. There is a juicy character to it, with spice and some firm, extracted tannins in the background. At this stage, it is still too dry and tannic and the wine needs time for the black fruits to come forward. Drink from 2017.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"Sanguine, gamy and powerful from the first moment onward, this 80% Cabernet Sauvignon also has 16% Merlot, 2% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. The power on the front palate evolves over time into black cherry and cassis, with shades of mocha lurking in. Firm and oaky, give this time, through 2018–2020.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a full-bodied wine, perfumed by its 25% Cabernet Franc and given a juicy fruitcake character by the smooth Merlot. It does still retain a crisper juicy acidity that will develop well as it ages over the next few months. Drink from late 2017.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Extravagantly floral on the nose, with blueberry, mineral and other particular aromas. But once you hit the palate, the acidity is extreme and thus the mouthfeel is sheering. Flavors of blueberry and mulberry are tangy, while the finish is angular. Too sharp and tangy to compete with the best, including Altamira and Bella Vista, Achaval-Ferrer's other single-vineyard big boys.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
Very faint notes of red berry are supported by floral overtones on the nose. The palate has pleasantly bitter elements that enhance the yeasty notes of bread crust. The body remains light while the finish is dry and balanced.,France-Alsace:Pinot Noir
"Sheldon's Roma's Vineyard Pinot Noir is exquisite. Very light in color (and alcohol level at 12.9 percent), it opens with gorgeous raspberry and violet aromas. Fully satisfying from start to finish, it has a lush mouthfeel, cherry spice high tones and a long, easy finish that will tempt you to want more. This is a beautiful wine. Only 60 cases made.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A little foxy at first, with lively, forward aromas of herbs, bramble, wild berry and black cherry. Doesn't take long in the glass to show its qualities, which include structure and plenty of fruit, herbs, pepper and dry spice on the palate. A voluminous, interesting Garnacha to slot into the everyday category.",Spain-Central Spain:Garnacha
"Thick, ripe, creamy and luscious, this 15.4% Sémillon carries itself with grace and style. The dense fruit flavors mix peaches, apricots, pears and spicy apples; with a hint of caramel and brown sugar. Though quite dry, it has so much fruit as to seem lightly sweet, and the high alcohol does not take away from the complexity. If it were not fermented dry, this would be a stunning late harvest dessert wine.",US-Washington:Sémillon
"Made with organically grown grapes, this opens with aromas of dark berry, violet, truffle and leather. The round chewy palate offers juicy black cherry, cinnamon and a balsamic note alongside soft acidity and supple tannins.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This is a big wine that's not ready now—it's too tannic. That gives it a lockdown, numbing quality that blocks a full appreciation of the fruit. But what fruit! Blackberries pure and simple, reduced to their quintessence. Such is the inherent integrity of this wine that it should effortlessly negotiate 4 to 6 years, gradually softening.",US-California:Syrah
"Clean and fresh, this value-priced southern Oregon Chardonnay offers balanced, elegant flavors of flower and fruit. Notes of apple and pear are front and center, with hints of white peach and cinnamon.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"At the bottom end of our range, this stalwart is tightly wound and fairly driven. Plum and cassis on the palate offer just the slightest nuance of cured Italian meat. Coffee is dominant on the long, linear finish. Now it's pretty dark and unevolved. Patience will be rewarded.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aged for 18 months in French oak, this is made predominantly from Tempranillo and it is a simple rendering of soy, black cherry, leather and big tannin weight.",US-California:Red Blend
"This is a lovely effort from a challenging vintage, offering up tarry notes that turn plummy and round with air. It's full-bodied without going over the top, with a long, concentrated finish framed by silky tannins. Drink now–2018.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend

"This plump and fruit-driven Barbaresco offers nuances of ripe cherry and forest berry backed by lingering tones of licorice, vanilla, dark chocolate and clove. The wine is distinguished by a precise and focused mouthfeel that is shaped by acidity and firm tannins.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"This 2007 is nearing the end of its shelf life, but it still features a round, ample mouthfeel and pleasant honey, peach and citrus flavors. Drink up.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style White Blend
"This stainless-steel-fermented white is lively in peach, apricot and guava flavors that are surprisingly lengthy and complex. Vanilla bean, wet stone and lemon add additional layers of goodness.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Brimming with ripe black plum and cherry flavors, this densely concentrated wine is unabashedly fruity and forward. It's well balanced though, showcasing crisp acidity and nuanced hints of rose petal and granite. Fine-grained but penetrating tannins persist on the finish.",US-New York:Merlot
"This wine is fruity, supported by firm tannins that integrate well with the acidity. While there is a delicious black currant and berry fruit character, this wine needs to develop richness as it matures. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Port:Port
"Attractively nutty and fruity, this approachable everyday drinking Port has just the right acidity, ripe almond and red fruits. The wine has a drier tannic element as well as the richer, sweeter raisins and spice. Like any tawny, it's ready to drink.",Portugal-Port:Port
"A cheerful blend of Nero d'Avola and Nerello Cappuccio, Calìo would pair well with potato gnocchi with butter and chopped sage. Cherry, wild berry and almond are backed by a powerful but smooth mouthfeel.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Red Blend
"Aromas of underbrush, ripe dark-skinned fruit, clove, espresso and a balsamic note lead the nose of this structured Sangiovese. The generous palate delivers juicy black cherry, blackberry, licorice and tobacco alongside velvety tannins. Drink 2016–2021.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Smooth and fresh, packed with juicy fruit, this is an immediately accessible, young wine. Black currant and plum juice, bright acidity. Drink next year.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red

"Pure Syrah, this distinguishes itself from the other 2013 Weisinger reds with clear varietal focus. Red licorice, citrus and mixed red fruits lead into a rather chalky, tannic finish.",US-Oregon:Syrah
"Gentle notes of creaminess and ripe pears signal a soft, creamy wine with lots of texture and body. The rounded body carries some weight and is edged with a bitter marzipan note. All this is countered by fresh acidity, more creamy, nutty notes and a vanilla finish.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"Candied berry and sweet oak are draped all over a ripe, rich nose. This is bright, fruity and cleanly made. Flavors of blueberry and cassis run sweet and oaky, while milk chocolate and residual berry fruit push the finish. The wine balances oakiness and sweetness.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec

"This is a delicate wine, true to variety with musky scents and flavors of beetroot, cherry and cola. The only off-note is a hint of plastic in the aftertaste.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"With the richness of the vintage, the natural tannins of Tannat are tamed by the welter of intense black fruits, sweet berries and Arabica coffee. The structure is exhibited in the dusty tannins under all the fruit.",France-Southwest France:Tannat
"From a vineyard 1,500 feet above the valley floor in Soda Canyon, blended with 4% Cabernet Sauvignon from Morisoli Vineyard, this is a beautiful beast of a wine, concentrated in red cherry and plum as well as mocha. Nicely weighted with soft tannin and length, it's well made and should age. Drink now through 2020.",US-California:Merlot
"Bready, oxidized aromas are imprecise and lacking in fruit. This is a blend of Palomino, Rufete Blanca and Moscatel from Salamanca, which is off the beaten path. A plump but flat palate of yeasty white-fruit flavors lacks zest on a fading finish. Drink now.",Spain-Central Spain:White Blend
"This wine is a blend of Two Blondes Cabernet Franc (50%), Benches Merlot (34%) and Dionysus Cabernet Sauvignon. Appealing scents of green herb, dark cherry and barrel spice are followed by plentiful cranberry and cherry flavors.

"A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon given two years in French oak, this sanguine, expertly structured and elegant wine offers plenty of bright cassis and blackberry flavor on the palate, seducing with complex layers of dried herb and black tea. Enjoyable now, this wine will also benefit from time; hold through 2022.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

An oily, grabby palate is cut by firm acidity, while flavors of tangerine, nopal and bell pepper finish short despite lively acidity.",Spain-Northern Spain:Verdejo
"Tart and spicy, this is loaded with flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, lightly dusted with accents of cocoa powder. The result is a pretty, slightly candied, ready-to-drink Pinot Noir.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This wine is both reduced and diluted, with astringency biting at its heels. It may simply be underripe.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"If you like Txakoli's high acidity and spritzy feel, then this is one of the best on the market. Waxy aromas of honeyed apple, warm radiator dust and cider are complex and pure. In the mouth, malic acidity rules, while flavors of nectarine, green apple and stony minerals finish long and pure.",Spain-Northern Spain:White Blend

"The Daou brothers' considerable and continual investments is evidence that their wines will matter for years, ensuring a wise investment today.

Give this wine a lot of breathing time or a vigorous decant, which will help to bring the fruit back up.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir

The nose turns out to be rich, jammy and convincing, while the palate is robust and features ripe plum and berry flavors. For bold fruit, vigor and drive, this answers the call. It could probably stand to be more elegant and nuanced, but as is it's a fine mix of Carmenère, Cabernet and Syrah.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Red Blend

The palate takes these further and wraps them up in fruit flavors that owe as much to lemon zest as they do to the peel of pear and russet apple.

"From one sniff, you know this is Gewürz, its rose-petal and lychee aromas erupting out of the glass. But the flavors are less expansive, picking up notes of peppery spice on the finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Gewürztraminer
"Pretty standard stuff, making it something of a disappointment in an Erste Gewächs context. Petrol notes upfront, followed by honey, pear and citrus fruit and a long, mineral-inflected finish. It's good, but this sample didn't sparkle.",Germany-Rheingau:Riesling
"A wine that shows an airy character. It is very open and fresh, the white fruits floating over a creamy texture and made crisp by grapefruit skin and bitter orange flavors. But it is just beginning to develop its potential, and the wine will likely fill out, as secondary flavors come through over the next 5–6 years.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend

"Core berry aromas are fresh and solid, while nuances of wild herbs, leather and smoky rubber give this Malbec some character out of the chute.

The palate shows lively, small bubbles that fizz excitedly, with further notions of green apple and tart lemon.

It would be an ace apéritif, totally refreshing and mouthwatering.",England-England:Sparkling Blend

Despite its heft and substantial 14.6% alcohol, this wine has a sleekness that carries it gracefully into a lengthy, elegant finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir

The palate shows similar layering, from black-cherry compote to herbs to black olives, proving unique overall.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Kandorian makes a stainless-steel version of Sauvignon Blanc, and also this heavily-oaked style, which is about as far in the other direction as possible. It's deep gold, scented with strong whiskey-barrel aromas, and tasting of nut oil and superripe apples, plus plenty of oak.",US-Oregon:Sauvignon Blanc
"Mint aromas and new wood flavors mark this smoothly ripe, polished wine. It has a good amount of black fruit, a dry but open texture and a rich, smoky character. The tannins and generous fruit power the wine forward.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Too sweet and Porty with sugared, caramelized wild berry flavors, and a pie-filling sweetness made heavy by high alcohol.",US-California:Zinfandel

There's a slight bit of alcoholic burn on the finish, but it doesn't drink as hot as you'd guess.",US-California:Syrah

"Syrah shows different aspects in cooler vintages such as 2011, which has brought out the leafy, herbal and peppery notes in full force. However this wine is ripe enough to offer plenty of good flavor, with brambly berry fruit that sings out for thin-crusted pizza.",US-Washington:Syrah
"The nose is loaded with mineral, pencil lead and blackberry notes. Generously juicy on the palate, this exudes youthful fruit backed by terroir-influenced notes.

"This wine is very young, still with layers of wood. It is going to be a structured, dense and packed with a strong mineral texture. To contrast, generous red plum fruits and intense acidity are ready to convey a deep, rich character. Drink this impressive wine from 2019",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"The bouquet of this earthy, aromatic vineyard-designate wine is bursting with freshly picked wildflowers and earth. The palate is mouthwatering in blueberry, strawberry and a bite of sour cherry.

"The 2014 vintage was slightly cooler than 2013 in the Barossa, which bodes well for Cabernet.

"Bosco Faiano is a hearty, masculine wine, aged 18 months in large oak casks to deliver dark notes of dried fruit, black currant, cured meat, leather and spice. At first, this tastes bold and raw, but after a few minutes in the glass, it shows a nice evolution toward elegance.",Italy-Southern Italy:Aglianico

"Tasting mature and mellow, this deceptively full-bodied wine has sun-baked aromas, prune and dried-cherry flavors, and a smooth texture. It's lightly tart on the finish.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Great structure, with crisp, supportive acids and a fine overlay of oak that seasons but doesn't overwhelm. The flavors are quite lean. The winemaker calls them mineral-like, but it's more like grapefruits and lemons. The main problem with this well-made wine is, in fact, this lack of flavor.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This brawny wine has attractive oaky, smoky, spicy aromas, generous fruit and spice flavors, full body and a good, gripping layer of tannin to add texture.",US-California:Grenache
"As this is tight and currently aloof, it lacks the generosity of the 2009 vintage, but it may prove to be more ageable. It has deep, earthy flavors of red currant, cola and balsam, and it could blossom into something even more complex after 2016.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Too dark and heavy for a Pinot Noir, with extracted, jammy flavors of grilled blackberries and cherries, as well as an herbal note of jasmine tea. Almost more like a Rhône wine, although on its own, it's a nice, dry sipper. Ready now.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"The fourth vintage of the BCD Estate, this offers high acidity around a core of ripe cherry fruit and earthy, pastoral overtones, the tannins nicely managed.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Dry and smoky on one hand, but also somewhat damp and soupy on the nose. This is a medium-to-full PN with a dark color and a mix of sweet and dry flavors as well as chunky oak and chocolate on the back palate. Creamy, sweet and showing a lot of barrel influence.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Pinot Noir
"Winemaker: Etienne le Riche. There are layers of aromas and flavors in this complex wine, starting with attractive scents of pressed purple flowers, wild strawberries, blackberries and woodspice. The palate is seriously spicy, but grounded by dense—yet not overdone—black fruit flavors. Medium acidity and structured tannins, followed by a long, evolving finish, complete the package. Harmonious, well integrated and balanced, drink 2020–2024.",South Africa-Stellenbosch:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fermented in stainless steel and then aged in neutral oak, this estate-driven white is crisp and complex, with what comes off as an intensity of dark oak. Gooseberry and lychee provide an intrigue on the nose, before a concentrated finish reveals high acidity.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"A soft wine without real definition, it has an attractive fruity character, but it's missing the firm structure of the appellation. With its vanilla and apricot flavors, this ripe Chardonnay is ready to drink.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This comes down on the sweet side, with orange, apricot and peach jam flavors. But the acidity is bright and clean. If you don't like sweet California wines, this isn't for you.",US-California:Pinot Gris
"The bubbles are a little scoury on this delightfully dry rosé, which makes it feel rough in the mouth. Aside from that, it's rich and complex in orange, strawberry, vanilla and yeasty flavors.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"Once coaxed out of the glass, there is something ethereal about this Pinot Noir in its compelling, lifted nose of elderberry, wild raspberry and aromatic nettle. It is deceptively light on the surface with translucent veils of silky tannins that draw you in. While there is engaging verve right now, this will come into its own once time has revealed the deeper layers of fruit. Drink from 2016.",Austria-Burgenland:Pinot Noir
"I continue to be impressed by how well even entry-level 2015 Sauvignons are developing. This one is understated and grapefruity, with hints of pea shoots and a silky feel. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"While intensely floral from nose to finish, this subtly nuanced Riesling has a more savory side as well, offsetting stark lemon, tangerine and lime flavors against wet stone and clay. It's ethereal and light on the palate, but finishes boldly with a lingering murmur of astringency.",US-New York:Riesling
"Some Napa Cabs that are ageable also are good to go now because the fruit is so ripe and the tannins are soft. Not this one. It's almost old-fashioned in tannins, with a lockdown astringency. But it's balanced and elegant, and the flavors are rich in blackberries, cherries, currants, cocoa and sweet oak. Give it at least six years in the cellar, and it could go for another 10 or 15.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine comes from the Les Pougets parcel, in the heart of the Corton-Charlemagne vineyard. It is an exceptional wine that's concentrated and dense, with ripe fruit packed into a impressively structured parcel. Yellow plums and cherries, taut pink grapefruit and fine wood aging all add complexity and longevity. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Dark pink-orange in color, this pungent 100% varietal wine was given no time in oak, allowing its crisp orange peel, grapefruit and cherry flavors to shine. Moderate acidity underlies the simple finish.",US-California:Zinfandel
"The nose of this wine is all about oak, with toast and char leading the way. The palate follows suit yet shows a bit more fruit, with grilled red-berry flavors washing over a lithe, crisp palate.",US-Virginia:Merlot
"Dense and one-dimensional, this opens with faint aromas of raisin, leather and a whiff of spice. The evolved palate offers stewed plum, a green note of unripe cherry, powdered sage and a hint of licorice. Raspy tannins create an abrupt, astringent finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"This tastes almost like a fortified wine, with strong alcohol heat boosting very dry wild-blackberry, pepper and prune flavors.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Lactic blackberry and dark plum aromas suggest a full, ripe wine. That impression is confirmed via a meaty, chunky palate with flavors of blackberry, dried plum, pepper and mixed herbs. A dry, peppery tasting finish with mild residual heat closes this offering.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Cassis and blackberry aromas are bold and show a feral side as this breathes. Fresh and charged up on the palate, this hits with cassis and blackberry flavors in front of a fruity, not oaky finish. Drink this pleasurable, well-made Malbec now through 2017.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Sugar saves the day in this dessert wine. It's very sweet and fruity, like a blackberry tart with the smoky crust, sauced up with sweetened espresso, shaved chocolate, candied orange zest and roasted coconut flakes.",US-California:Syrah
"The first release for Tranche from Blue Mountain (estate) fruit, this classic Cabernet benefits from the same extended aging in barrel and bottle that sister winery Corliss gives its wines. Toasty, smoky and precisely defined dark fruit hold down the core, a muscular mix of black cherry, cassis, dried herb and leaf. Firm and compact, with well-integrated barrel flavors (two thirds were new), this balances Euro elegance with New World vitality.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"One of two Sparkman Syrahs, Darkness showcases fruit from two stellar Yakima valley vineyards, Boushey and Olsen. A whiff of Syrah funk, herb and earth ties into dried blueberry with a brambly, plummy component. Lovely details of nutmeg with a streak of vanilla keep the flavors interesting through a long finish.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Dijon clone again. This has just the vaguest hint of onion, but otherwise is much improved over this property's '99. There is good, juicy, crisp fruit mixing apple/apricot and light citrus. Balanced acids and a well integrated middle that leads into a somewhat hot, stiff finish. Young and edgy, but well made.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"There's a rainbow of peppercorns represented on the nose of this varietally classic wine, with a tiny bit of pasilla chile greenness cutting across strawberry and cherry fruit. Those red fruits join with blueberry on the palate, which is complex with pipe tobacco, tomato leaf and herbal, peppery spices.",US-California:Cabernet Franc
"A special bottling commemorating Edwards' 40 years as a winemaker, this wine is made from a clonal selection created by her in 1975. The fruit is from both the Coopersmith and Georganne vineyards, made in a tiny amount. Built to age, it wraps earthy dried herbs around cherry, strawberry and boysenberry, with a juicy core of acidity. A forested hint of spearmint dances at its edge, as strong suggestions of bacon and pepper build on the finish. Drink now through 2028.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A fruity blend of local Lisboa grapes along with Chardonnay, this wine is rich and full of citrus and crisp apple flavors. It is a ripe wine with a creamy texture enhanced by toast from the wood aging. Drink this wine from late 2017.",Portugal-Lisboa:Portuguese White

"Made with 100% Merlot, this has subdued aromas suggesting ripe red berry and dark spice. The one-dimensional palate isn't very expressive, offering hints of dried plum and clove alongside rather evolved tannins.",Italy-Tuscany:Merlot
"This offers aromas of yellow stone fruit, chopped herb and a whiff of white almond. The round, juicy palate shows apricot, white peach, candied orange zest and a mineral note. Fresh acidity brightens the ripe flavors.",Italy-Southern Italy:Greco
"An aromatic tour de force, this perfumed wine offers hypnotic notes of flowers, green olive, asparagus, sea breeze, mineral, peat, smoke flowers and an earthy funk, showing layers of complexity. The palate's lithe frame belies the richness of the smoke, fire pit and grilled meat flavors that linger.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Consistent with many other Timothy Malone Pinots, this artfully melds black cherry fruit with a broad streak of cola and refreshing minerality. There's a touch of black licorice and impressive balance throughout.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Named after a Portuguese dance, this fresh, fruitcake and blackberry-flavored wine is easily ready to drink, a wine that powers through with its sweet, juicy fruit and final acidity.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"Soft, smooth and delicious, this offers a beautiful example of the modern cult style of flashy drinkability. It tastes expensive, with refined tannins and ripe blackberry, cassis and oak flavors. This could be an ager. From Laura Zahtila.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Underbrush, saddle leather, dark berry and culinary spice aromas slowly unfold in the glass. Succulent and full bodied, the firmly structured palate delivers raspberry compote, ripe Marasca cherry, baking spice and pipe tobacco framed in youthfully assertive but noble tannins and bright acidity. A savory mineral note lingers on the finish. This is one for the long haul. Drink 2025–2053.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo

"This blend of Blaufränkisch, Syrah and Merlot is Höpler's signature wine. It makes for a fascinating combination of ripe black-plum flavors highlighted by juicy acidity and wood notes. The wine will age well, so drink from 2015. Screwcap.",Austria-Burgenland:Red Blend
"Made of 48% Sangiovese, 35% Montepulciano, 10% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has black-skinned fruit and baking spice aromas. The firm palate delivers black cherry, black currant and tobacco notes in a frame of fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"This rich, opulent prestige cuvée lives up to the Séduction name, instantly appealing with its ripe yellow fruit and generous texture. It is just approaching maturity, with hints of toast. Drink now or, even better, from 2017.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"The texture is smooth and velvety on this Zinfandel, but the flavors are off. You'll find ripe blackberry jam and currants right next to overripe raisins. Enormously high alcohol makes this wine taste like a fruity, simple port.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This is austere on the nose, with a strong animal note riding along. The palate is both jammy and tannic, while flavors of plum and boysenberry turn raisiny as it breathes. A thick, loamy finish tastes baked and jammy, with brawny tannins. This may benefit from more time in bottle.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"Soft, simple and semisweet, this Tempranillo has cherry, raspberry and spice flavors. It can be described as rustic.",US-California:Tempranillo
"Smoothly seductive, this wine showcases an amazing site with great skill, coaxing high-toned squeezes of mandarin orange, honeysuckle and anise from a foundation of balance and acidity. Luxurious, the oak plays a supporting role, never distracting from a core of freshness and finesse.",US-California:Chardonnay
"The appetizing and enticing savoriness of freshly chopped dill runs like a faultline through this concentrated, yet elegant red. Ripe cherry hides behind the straightening tannins of oak and waits to burst out as this softens with a little bottle age. Very finely-knit tannins extend a gentle grip and frame a compelling, layered wine. Drink from 2016–2020.",Austria-Thermenregion:St. Laurent
"Made entirely in stainless steel, this is only the second vintage for this wine, and it's a good start. Flavors are bold and assertive, with notes of green apple and citrus that finish lemony and mouthwatering. Drink now.",Italy-Southern Italy:Fiano

"This pure Chardonnay has a tight, nervy mineral texture that gives great freshness as well as a crisp apple skin and lemon zest character. It is fruity, full of lively acidity that goes with the perfumed, refreshing aftertaste.",France-Champagne:Chardonnay
"This makes a nice choice for your house white wine to buy by the case. Attractively rich, it seems to be all about the fruit flavor. It brings ripe pear and peach notes, an opulent texture and lingering fruity finish. It is medium-bodied, smooth and complete.",US-California:Pinot Grigio
"A bit thin and astringent, yet with a powerful, clear focus that conjures up straight cranberry fruit flavors. Baking spices and a hint of cocoa penetrate through the hard shell of acid and tannin. Needs more time.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This offers light berry and melon flavors, with a tart, slightly peppery bite. Good texture and overall balance make this a pleasant quaffer.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This is a simple, clean wine, with light fruit and approachable acidity. The finish is soft and easy.",France-Provence:Rosé

"This wine is soft, rounded and already ripe. With its gentle acidity and touches of spice and pepper, it is smooth and ready to drink.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay

"Big and strong, with full but easy black-fruit aromas. Ripeness is where it should be, as cassis and berry flavors work the consistent palate before giving way to a medium-long finish. Along the way there are hints of herbs, coffee and cherry cough drop.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon
This wine offers a sizable mouthful of blackberry and softened though persistent and present tannins. On the nose a whiff of rubber glove mars the wine.,US-California:Syrah
"There's a severity of acids and tannins that limits this Pinot's immediate enjoyment. It feels tight and hard, despite a core of black and red cherries and the sweetness of toasty oak. All indications point to the cellar. Give it 6–7 years, and it could be going strong well after 2020.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This wine opens with very flinty aromas of struck graphite and pencil shavings, with touches of fermenting orange and cranberry. It's light in weight but darkly flavored on the palate, with slate and clove spice.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Soft scents of lavender introduce this pale rose-colored Pinot Noir. It's a light, elegant wine with clean, tart flavors of rhubarb and sour cherry that don't reflect the stated alcohol of 13.9% abv.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"A rich, mellow wine, still with some ripe fruit, softness and fine balance. There are yeast and toast aromas and flavors that fill out the mouth with creaminess and point up the soft apricot flavors. Delicious. Tasted from a magnum.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"This has so much rich earth and minerality, it's like a journey deep into a mine. It's noted the vines were planted in 1970, and the wine does have that old-vine concentration of fruit in the form of massively intense blackberries. Then there's the smoky new oak, which adds such a lusciously sweet jacket of buttered toast. Tannic and tight in the way of Diamond Mountain Cabernets, this should begin to come into its own after 2016.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"100% Malbec, it's redolent with dark plums, wild blueberries and peppery spices. The soft, silky flavors are light but have good concentration with the oak (80% American) seeming quite dialed back.",US-Washington:Malbec
"This 100% Grenache was aged in neutral French oak. It's dry in style, but rich, with flavors of raspberries, strawberries, cherries and toast. An edge of acidity adds verve.",US-California:Rosé

"This medium-weight, slightly creamy rosé opens with soft aromas of white cherry, peach, cantaloupe and cranberry. The melony flavors continue through to the palate, while the finish offers an astringent citrus-pith flavor. Drink now.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon:Rosé

"Gritty, reedy, minty aromas overshadow this Tempranillo blend's hollow berry scents. Hard, tannic and drawn in, this wine tastes of rustic plum and berry fruits along with hard spices. Notes of tomato, green herbs and raw tannins create a rugged finish.",Spain-Northern Spain:Red Blend
"Brilliantly aromatic, this wine beguiles with exotic scents of plum pudding, spice cake, cherry compote, pipe tobacco, red licorice and raspberry jam. All that and more can be tasted—the wine is a riot of fruits and baking spices. This makes the best possible case for Mourvèdre as a stand-alone varietal wine here in Washington.",US-Washington:Mourvèdre
"The great dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend has given this wine both a fine structure and crisp swathes of black-currant fruit. It is a firm wine at this stage, although the fine fruitiness will become an important part of the taste. The estate is named after one of Napoleon's generals who became King of Sweden. Drink from 2021.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Sourced from the Bacchus vineyard, this is an oaky, buttery Chardonnay that's fine for an every day quaffer. The oaky flavors quickly overtake fruit that is simple, clean, and apple flavored.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"A ripe wine that has red-berry fruits, slices of black plum and a full deck of tannins. It is concentrated and ripe, full of fruit and equally full of structure. Let the two soften and drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Delicately scented with whiffs of white spring flower, citrus and orchard fruit, this straightforward wine offers flavors suggesting pear, juicy pineapple and bitter almond. Tangy acidity brightens the finish and gives it a clean close.",Italy-Southern Italy:Falanghina
"Tough in tannins, with an astringent, lockdown quality. That's the iron fist of this wine. The velvet glove is the rich, flamboyant core of blackberries and cassis. Give this young wine at least six years to come around.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This delicious and refreshing wine comes from the plateau above the Douro Valley, giving it a cool character along with a mineral and spice texture. The wine is perfumed from the 20% Moscatel in the blend. Drink now.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese White
"Crisp, clean aromas of Asian pear, Pink Lady apple, dried pineapple and a touch of dried melon show on the nose of this wine from a group of Malibu vintners. The palate shows ripe apple and brown-pear flavors, with a bubblegum twist and lime-juice acidity.",US-California:Chardonnay

"A broad, ripe wine, it is simply fruity with attractive lemon and grapefruit flavors, touched by gooseberries. It's tangy, textured and likely to age for a 2–3 years, but you can also drink now.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"The estate is owned by the Olazabal family, descendants of Antonia Ferreira who created this and many other estates in the 19th century. This is a major wine, ripe and full of rich tannins and concentrated fruit. It is always one of the longest-lived wines from the Douro and this vintage has the structure and the fruit weight to develop well. An attractive spicy, smoky character adds extra interest. Drink from 2022.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"The wine is bone dry, with lots of mouthwatering acidity. The flavors are reticent but complex, suggesting sour blackberry candy and cherry skins, along with some firm tannins. Try aging it until 2017 to let it soften as much as it ever will.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Notshowing much generosity now, pinched by tough tannins that give it a scoury astringency. Deep inside is a molten core of cherries and cola, with complex earth, mushroom and mineral notes. Pretty soft, but dry and focused, and could age well. Try after 2014.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"With the classic tongue-tickle of young Vinho Verde, this fresh, crisp and off-dry wine is immediately drinkable. It has ripe orange and sweet citrus fruitiness, and plenty of acidity.",Portugal-Vinho Verde:Portuguese White
"The name is a play on words. Merli is the plural of “blackbirds,” and this wine is 100% Merlot. But it isn't for the birds. Black as night in the glass, with a brooding power that's confirmed on the palate. What's special about it is that unlike so many flabby Merlots, it carries Chianti-like acidity and an unbridled raciness. Excellent now with food, and it will age well, too.",Italy-Tuscany:Merlot
"Focused crisp aromas of white fruits reflect a cool vintage. This is roughly one-quarter each Macabeo, Parellada, Xarello and Chardonnay, and it feels tight, fresh and focused. Dry stone-fruit flavors include a hint of lime, while this is clean on the finish.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"This Pinot is lightly peppery with fruit flavors of watermelon and strawberry. They're expanded with generous skin phenolic flavors from 50% whole cluster fermentation, then softened with aging in neutral oak. Though a light wine overall, it's complex and holds your attention.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Arger-Martucci hits bigtime with this Cabernet Franc-based Bordeaux-style blend. It marches in a different direction from the soft cult style, showing brisk acidity, hard tannins and relatively moderate alcohol. Yet there's nothing light about the complex blackberry, cherry and currant flavors. Wonderful to drink now, and it will reward aging over the next 5–6 years.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This blend of Merlot (81%), Cabernet Franc (11%) and Cabernet Sauvignon is directly appealing with accents of baker's chocolate, vanilla, blackberry, crushed flowers and raspberries. It's soft and supple in feel with focused fruit flavors and a finish that won't quit.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Only the second vintage of this vineyard-designate wine from an estate property, this bottling offers spicy cherry, black tea and dried herb, backed by oaky backbone and structure. Dark chocolate and leather play on the palate in subtle waves, hitting their strides on the finish. Cellar through 2020.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Co-fermented with 5% Viognier, this wine's appealing fresh flower, orange peel, ham hock and black olive tapenade aromas jump out of the glass. The palate is light, tart and sleek, not delivering on all that the aromas suggest but still providing plenty of intrigue.",US-Washington:Syrah
"A clean, brisk Chardonnay made from this small, cool part of Monterey County's Salinas Valley. Shows its region's bright acidity, and also its long hangtime flavors of pineapples, peaches, green apples, limes and minerals. Nothing fancy or showy, just a really nice Chard at a fair price.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Ripe strawberries and crisp acidity blend together in this refreshing, crisp and fruity wine. Produced from Cabernet Franc, the wine is lightly perfumed and with a final shot of bright acidity. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley:Rosé

"This wine offers notes of toasted vanilla bean, herbs and red fruit. It's broad in feel while the fruit flavors are elegant in style, with the supple feel bringing much of the enjoyment.",US-Oregon:Syrah
"Aromas of pear, citrus and almond should be familiar to anyone who knows Chilean Chardonnay, but to call this wine elevated or beyond regular would be a stretch. The palate is slightly lemony and green, and the finish has a persistent tang. Seems like basic Casablanca Chard to us.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Chardonnay
"What has become Portugal's national red grape shows well here. It has the characteristic violet and hedgerow berry fruit perfumes that go with some firm tannins and black currant fruit flavors. It is a wine that will be ready to drink soon, so just wait until late 2016.",Portugal-Alentejano:Touriga Nacional
"Starts off with apple and pineapple aromas, but quickly develops intensely mineral flavors to go alongside. Likewise, it seems round—almost fat—in the mouth at first, then finishes with refreshing acidity, a mouthwatering mix of sweet and tart.",Germany-Mosel-Saar-Ruwer:Riesling
"Fiery, hot aromas feature raspberry, burnt leaves, balsamic notes and earth. It's wild and jumpy in the mouth, with rhubarb and cranberry defining the tight, underdeveloped palate, while the finish is tangy and almost peachy. Shows many cool-year characteristics of a 2002.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"The nose on this bottling is very familiar and approachable, with tons of baking spices like clove, star anise and vanilla alongside red cherries. The same red fruit upholds the palate, which is nuanced by eucalyptus and bay leaf as well as a graphite minerality.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Baked mulberry, black cherry and brown spice lead into more nuanced notes of iron, turned earth and carpaccio meatiness on the nose of this blended bottling by Rick Longoria. Dark red-fruit flavors show on the sip, framed by a tannic tension that will steadily reveal more elements in years to come.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Made with 90% Nasco and 10% Malvasia, this full-bodied dessert wine opens with intense aromas of tangerine zest, dried fruit and a whiff of baking spice. The rich palate delivers mature apricot, roasted hazelnut and orange-blossom honey. A vanilla note closed the lingering finish.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:White Blend

"A vibrant minerality consumes the aromas on this bottling from an extremely coastal vineyard. On the palate, strawberry and sagebrush flavors emerge, all couched in a clean, crisp and refreshing acidity with appropriate bitterness as well. Ready to drink now.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Sheer tones of lemon, tart pineapple and lime invigorate the nose and palate of this feather-light Auslese. Its juicy tangerine sweetness makes it refreshingly gulpable, but a dust of pollen on the finish lends nuance. Drink now through 2020.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"This is a toasty, tasty, forward and easy-drinking Pinot Noir. Flavors of black cherry soda, cola and light toast are front and center, and the finish comes on clean and refreshing.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir

"The 12th-century Château de Grézels forms the backdrop to this ripe, perfumed and structured wine. It's solid, firm with layers of toast from the wood aging. The black plum fruits form the other component, giving the potential for a generous, full-bodied wine as it ages. Drink from 2018.",France-Southwest France:Malbec-Merlot
"This is ripe and a bit raisiny with prune and fig notes to the bold bouquet. This feels chunky on the palate, but not fat or out of shape. Baked black fruit and raisin flavors finish solid and ready, with a note of licorice and an overriding sense of richness. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Catalonia:Red Blend
"Textured vanilla-cream and green apple appear initially in this wine, which offers plenty of weight and structure around a core of balanced acidity and fresh lemon zest. Cardamom and vanilla play at the edges alongside elements of savory brine and white flowers. The oak presence is subtle.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Here's a very correct and clean Sangiovese with bright cherry nuances and blueberry followed by a touch of bitter almond. The mouthfeel is thin, easy and watery.",Italy-Central Italy:Sangiovese
"Lightly oxidized and briny on the nose, this hints at fino Sherry, which isn't bad per se. A lemony, high-acid palate is home to salty flavors of citrus rind and briny stone fruits. The finish is more of the same.",Chile-Leyda Valley:Chardonnay
"A wine that goes straight into currants along with more exotic fruit like mango. That makes it rich in taste, as well as soft in texture. The acidity is there, but seems almost incidental, lost in the vivid fruits.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
Attractively perfumed this ripe wine has hints of the crisp acidity that is also there. It's a fresh wine with the potential of richness. Ripe pink grapefruit and tangy acidity are balanced by the warmer flavors of pear and quince. Drink from late 2015.,France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"There's brilliant black cherry and blackberry richness on the nose of this blend of 10 grapes, from Syrah to Malbec to Touriga Nacional, as well as a mineral character of cold asphalt, clay and mud. The palate offers earthy and delicious flavors, with dried strawberry and olallieberry as well as black pepper and cappuccino.",US-California:Red Blend
"This is a nicely blended mix of 37% Zinfandel with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah, Syrah, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. The kitchen-sink effort rewards in juicy red fruit, herbal, cedar accents and medium-bodied weight and tannin strength. The finish is lengthy in vanilla and smoke.",US-California:Red Blend
"Scratchy, horsey berry aromas set up a fresh, regular palate. Plum, berry and peppery flavors are basic, while the finish dries out fast while showing a wood character along with juicy acidity.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo

"Intended as a take on Rioja, this is noticeably volatile, dusty and loaded with chocolaty barrel flavors. Cocoa and raspberry are in the mix, but it's chocolate that runs away with the finish.",US-Oregon:Tempranillo
"This well-oaked, smoky wine is a great value. It has abundant baking spice aromas, as well as rich flavors of ripe pear, nutmeg and vanilla. Ample acidity and delicate tannins help maintain balance.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This well-balanced ripe wine shows the hand of Pedro Sâ, wine and vineyard director for all Sogevinus Ports. Sweet with a hint of yeastiness and good acidity, its ripe strawberry flavors are strong and fresh. This is a pink Port wine that is ripe and fruity, finishing with both sweetness and freshness. Drink now but with this blend, Kopke doesn't rule out sip-store-sip over a couple months.",Portugal-Port:Port
"If this delicious bottling is any indication, this region is prime for Malbec. Aromas of grape soda, black slate, turned loam, blueberry and purple flowers make for a nicely even nose, and the palate is rich and full with balanced tannins. The juicy flavors include black cherries, plums, cassis and blueberry extract, to which crushed, dried herbs give necessary nuance.",US-California:Malbec
"This wine delivers light herb and citrus aromas. The flavors seem washed out, lacking cohesion. It comes off as quite generic.",US-Washington:Sauvignon Blanc
"Exquisitely fragrant notes of ripe, aromatic apples rise from the glass: tart, fruity and fresh in equal measure. The palate shows both evolved autolysis by way of soy-spiced breadiness and even more fruit in the way of bruised, tart apple notes of great purity. The finish is long and full of flavor, complex, nuanced and resolutely dry.",France-Alsace:Sparkling Blend
"Fairly mute on the nose, with an oily note and peachy aromas. Basic in the mouth, with good weight and balance along with oily flavors of peach and melon. Sweet and waxy on the finish, with the flavor of green banana.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Chardonnay
"There is an impressive density to the nose of this blend of 88% Syrah and 12% Grenache, with blueberry and black currant showing alongside crushed gravel and tar. The palate is rich with dark fruits and dark spices, showing baked black plum torte, a touch of fennel and a tart finish.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is a big, powerful, firm wine, with a top layer of ripe, glamorous fruit flavors. Blackcurrant jelly fruits are shot through with ripe acidity and soft tannins. It should develop relatively fast, but then last well.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Deep, attractive aromas of blackberry, cassis, prune and toast are what Toro is known for. This is intense on the palate but in good balance, with strong but tolerable tannins. Blackberry, cassis, black cherry and toasty flavors finish with an iron grip. Drink from 2018–2028.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tinta de Toro
"A smoky nose with hints of flint and stone fruit leads the way on this linear white. The juicy palate delivers yellow peach, crisp apple, lemon drop and a hint of ginger alongside bright acidity.",Italy-Veneto:Garganega
"Like taking in a fresh bouquet of flowers just in bloom, this deliciously crafted Moscato Frivolo, slightly fizzy and superlatively refreshing, is a lovely surprise at just 7% alcohol and $16. Start your night off with a glass or let it guide you through a meal, serve cold and take in its candied orange and jasmine amidst the bubbles.",US-California:Moscato
"This Rhône-style blend is rich and forward, with blackberry, cherry and raspberry jam flavors. A sweet, spicy flavor is pretty much all you get.",US-California:G-S-M
"This is a crisp, dry wine that exibits delicious acidity, along with fresh citrus and green-apple flavors. It's bright and fruity, but has a textured undertow that promises good bottle aging. Ready to drink now, but could also benefit by cellaring for a year.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Like the '03, this Merlot is a little too sweet for comfort, showing sugary cherry flavors that taste like melted jam. It's also very soft and lacks a firm structure.",US-California:Merlot
"Mainly Pinot Noir, with some Chardonnay for brightness and citrusy zest, this brilliantly clean wine has an incredibly fierce mousse. It seems to boil in the glass, and the followup mouthfeel is as creamy and refined as any California sparkler in memory. The Pinot asserts itself in delicate touches of raspberries and strawberries. Delicious and compelling now. Try with sushi.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"This is 100% Cabernet, with the purity that is a recurring hallmark of Rulo's wines. A deep, and deeply satisfying fruit expression, lifted with juicy acidity, brings a mélange of berries, cassis and black cherries into play. The grace notes pile on—smoke, black olive, tar, tobacco leaf, bitter chocolate. Young, bracing, and built to age.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is initially marked by scents of charred oak and espresso beans. With aeration, the cherry fruit become more apparent. It's medium to full in body, with silky yet firm tannins that reflect the vineyard's clay soils.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Pinot Noir
"Buttered toast, vanilla cream, honey and jammy pineapple, lime and mango flavors give this Chardonnay incredible richness. Monterey acidity balances the palate briskly. Not particularly subtle, but a big, enjoyable wine.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Flat stewy prune-like aromas are low on life but not off-putting. This feels wide grabby and tannic, while jammy flavors of raspberry and plum finish chunky and expansive, but also tannic and wan. Drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Overripe, with raisiny flavors, and hot in alcohol. Tart acidity gives it cut.",US-California:Zinfandel
"A classic Napa Valley Bordeaux blend, dry, smooth, complex and elegant. Based on Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it's an instant pleaser, from the dryness and mellow texture to the delicious blackberry, cassis, plum, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. It will provide wonderful drinking over many years.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is on the full-bodied side, quite ripe and tropical in style compared to its Marlborough siblings. Mango, pineapple and stone-fruit notes are all present, balanced on the finish by citrus and ginger.",New Zealand-Martinborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"This is one of the entry-level ranges from this top producer. The wine is sophisticated. It has a strong mineral texture and fine ripe citrus and pear fruits shot through with acidity. With its finishing fruitiness, this is already an attractive wine, although it will be better from 2018.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of toast, char, and milk chocolate along with blue and black fruit are followed by velvety soft fruit flavors. It shows an appealing sense of balance and polish.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Intensely fruity, almost tropical, on the nose and palate, this concentrated, juicy Gewürztraminer balances rich melon and lychee flavors with delicate notes of tea and spice. Just a hint off-dry in style.",US-New York:Gewürztraminer
"A solid, structured cru wine with a fine line in tannins and black-cherry fruits. It is dense with a firm, dry core. Surrounding it are ripe fruits and acidity. A wine to keep a few more months, so drink from late 2017.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"The palate of rich, fleshy and ripe pear is already signalled on the nose and relaxes into softly sweet juiciness at its fruity core. Fresh acidity means that it stays sprightly and finishes just off dry.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
This off-dry Riesling offers an abundance of juicy lemon and green apple refreshment. It's approachable and fresh with a lingering sweetness that's not at all cloying. The finish is brisk and clean.,Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"Here's a modern and beautiful wine with warming tones of vanilla, spice, chocolate and blackberry. The wine is thick and dense with dark extraction and very solid tannins. Drink after 2010. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.",Italy-Southern Italy:Aglianico
"This exciting project comes from veteran winemaker William Hill. Although it's packed with rich black-currant and cassis-liqueur flavors that sink down in the midpalate and offer fruity satisfaction, the finish is firm and classic. The vineyard is on Atlas Peak, and the wine shows those mountain tannins but also fine minerality. Drink 2017–2025.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Delicate aromas of pressed spring flower, yellow apple and citrus carry over to the brisk palate along with a mineral note. Vibrant acidity gives it a crisp, tangy finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Bianco
"This wine offers aromas of underbrush, meat juices and farmyard together with notes of overripe red berries. The palate delivers wild cherry accented with almost-sugary sweet vanilla extract sensations, mocha and cinnamon-spice alongside assertive tannins that carry through to the drying finish. Drink 2015–2019.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This is a ripe, smoky wine with fine tannins and rich black fruit. Dense with black chocolate and damson flavors, it gives concentration and richness and will age well. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This round, soft, alcoholic wine deserves praise for its spicy-peppery warmth and abundant cherry fruit. Those same qualities are also its biggest shortcoming: The low acidity and high alcohol make it seem a bit heavy. —J.C",Australia-South Australia:Grenache
"This is quite unusual, loaded with notes of green herb, leaf, fiddlehead fern, pepper and lemon verbena. It's herbal and not at all disagreeable, though fruit-lovers may want to look elsewhere. Just 50 cases of this wine were made.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Aromas of crushed violet, baked plum, cake spice, ripe berry and tobacco pervade in this bold, full-bodied red. The firm palate offers ripe black cherry, fig, mocha, nutmeg, licorice and tobacco alongside velvety tannins.",Italy-Veneto:Red Blend
"Ripe, spicy and full both of ripe fruits and tannins, this is a full-bodied wine that brings out the minerality and structure of a Douro wine. It has plenty of red fruits to balance these tannins, resolving into the wine that is firm but ready to drink.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"Kennedy Point is located on Waiheke Island, but gets the fruit for this wine from Marlborough. It's a light- to medium-bodied version of Sauvignon Blanc, boasting bright passion-fruit aromas and a juicy, mouthwatering mix of citrus flavors that fade a bit quickly on the finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"This is the second wine of Vieille Cure, one of the leading Fronsac estates. It is aging well, moving from fruit to mature, secondary flavors, softening in the process. Wood aging has balanced the blackberry fruit with spice and made it ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Dry, spicy, crisp aromas of cool-climate red fruits come with a mild covering of sweet oak. This is a touch resiny on the palate, with woody, spicy flavors of plum and raspberry. An oaky, lightly herbal finish is juicy in feel.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Pinot Noir
"Absolutely dry and tingly in acidity, this citrus-flavored wine is clean and zesty. It's a fine appetizer sipper for cleansing the palate. Serve it with little munchies, like grilled veggies, goat cheese and crackers with crab salad.",US-California:Pinot Grigio
"Dry, minty and spicy, with cool, lightweight berry and cola aromas. The palate is fairly light and easy, with lean red-fruit flavors, dry spice and a creamy tasting accent. Spice more than fruit carries the finish. Pedestrian wine that's competent.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"Typical of Egon Müller's wines, this is light in body, but titanium-strong in structure, welding rather tart, lemony fruit to stony, minerally notes and embellishing it all with the merest hints of riper, apple-y fruit. It's just off-dry, with great persistence and lipsmacking appeal.",Germany-Mosel-Saar-Ruwer:Riesling
"Herbal raspberry and strawberry aromas are raw and a bit green. This feels scratchy as well, with tomatoey flavors of red currant and plum skins. A modest finish is racy in feel but mild in flavor.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A decent everyday sipper. Soft and a little dull in texture, it's rich in blackberry, currant, chocolate and pecan pie flavors.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Whole clusters of Syrah are co-fermented with Viognier to create this tight, concisely crafted wine. This is a firm expression of field and grape, with bright berry fruit and chocolaty tannins. The slightly chalky finish may smooth out with a bit more bottle age.",US-Washington:Syrah
"The faintest touch of vanilla and cream barely manages to contain the fragrance of white summer blossom. The palate offers a return to classically restrained, creamy but well-integrated oaked Chardonnay with light-footed balance.",Austria-Burgenland:Chardonnay
"An ultrarich Cabernet whose ripe fruit is as elaborate as you can get. Ditto for the soft, plush tannins and the wealth of fine, sweet oak. Despite the wealth of blackberry, currant, dark chocolate and cola flavors, it's not a wine to drink now, because the tannins and acids are so pert. Give it a good six years in the cellar.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Named after the vultures which fly in the Douro, this solid, structured wine is full of tannins as well as ripe fruit. It comes from a good red wine vintage, allowing the structure to develop richly with a good concentration. The wine still needs time, so drink from 2017.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"If your impression of South America Malbec has been shaped by Argentina, then this Chilean example will be appealing. It's ripe and dense, with blackberry and animal hide aromas. The palate is rock solid in feel, with concentrated flavors of blackberry, cassis, cumin, pepper and chocolate. This gets oakier, darker and more compact on the finish.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Malbec
"Made with 75% Sangiovese, with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon and Barbera, this wine has aromas of barrel spices, coffee, dark raspberries and herbs. It's medium bodied with plump fruit flavors, tart acids and a lightly chalky feel.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Rondinaia means “swallow's refuge,” but you're going to want to swallow lots of this unoaked wine as proof that great Chard does come from Italy, and that it can be terrific without wood. Emphasizing fragrant apple and pear aromas, it has a wonderful natural texture and a smooth, stony finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"On the western edge of the appellation, in what locals call the Sebastopol Hills, this wine shows its provenance well, imparting wild, exotic aromas and flavors of crunchy red fruit and Asian spice. Silky, savory and inviting, it's also pretty, with impressive depth, persistent acidity and chunks of turned earth and pine.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"From the producer's own dry-farmed estate, this is a concentrated, full-bodied expression of the grape at its best, dense in chocolate and blackberry, almost syrup-like in its heady, brambly style. Burly integrated tannin create a significant foundation of weight and length, that's completely ready to be enjoyed now, yet may take on further nuance through 2023.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Trine, named for the three main partners at Pepper Bridge winery, is predominantly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with a final 12% of the blend divvied up among the other three Bordeaux red grapes. It shows good balance and complexity, phenolic ripeness, texture and herbal detail. But despite so many good traits, it has less concentration than most wines in its price category.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Red in color, with fresh aromas of nectarine, orange peel and red currant. For a 2010 this is still fresh and sturdy, with cleansing acidity and focused flavors of citrus and red berry fruit. Eminently drinkable, with a long finish for basic rosé. Drink immediately.",Spain-Northern Spain:Rosé
"Lots of sweet, ripe cherries in this Syrah, which also shows classic, cool-climate aromas of black pepper. A disagreeable note of crushed cigarette butts is a big minus.",US-California:Syrah
"A bright, floral violet bouquet invites in this blend of Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petite Sirah that follows through with earthy cherry and strawberry highlights. Softly textured, the wine is deeply structured and in balance, a delicious offering of several varieties married well.",US-California:Red Blend
"Tightly wound and floral, this wine has bright acidity with earthy cola and clove accents. Medium bodied, with some heft on the palate, it's ripe and rewarding in cherry and berry fruit flavors.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Aromas of pear, stone fruit and lees lead to peach and floral flavors. The concentration is light and elegant.",US-Washington:Viognier
"This offers aromas of baked earth, pressed rose, dark cooking spice and mature plum. The bright palate offers black cherry, raspberry, clove and anise accompanied by vibrant acidity. Enjoy through 2016.",Italy-Piedmont:Barbera
"Who wouldn't love this Pinot Noir? It's zippy in acidity and ripe in briary raspberry and cherry fruit, with spicy, smoky oak complexity. Really defines the luxurious silkiness of the appellation. The grapes are mostly from the Fiddlestix Vineyard, with the balance hailing from Rio Vista Vineyard. Drink now-2015.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Mild scents of cassis, coffee grounds and worn saddle leather mark the nose of this Petit Verdot. The palate is medium bodied and pliant, and though the alcohol only clocks in at12.5%, it feels warm. Faint tannins add a dust-like traction to the flavors of dried strawberry and spiced mocha.",US-Virginia:Petit Verdot
"The 17.5% alcohol is a bit much, but the burning effect is dampened by the mouthfeel's extraordinary thickness and richness. It's big and bold, with intense aromas of toasted nut, vanilla, chocolate fudge, blackberry jam and exotic spice.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Ripe blackberries, violet flowers, tobacco, mocha, smoke and asphalt swirl into an intriguing nose. Dense flavors of black cherries and kirsch are evened out by licorice, black tea and a pine-sap element that carries through the finish.",US-California:Syrah
"This wine is soft, indistinct at this stage. It needs to develop more of the fruitiness that is behind the bland exterior. The aftertaste has good freshness.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Made in a fuller-bodied style, this wine remains nonetheless balanced, the acidity subtle but offering structure and freshness. On the nose, tropical coconut and orange zest is suggested, while the palate remains soft and mouthfilling in juicy black cherry, an intensity of oak rising on the finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is a light, pleasant, balanced Syrah that shows a mix of earth, herb, saline, soy, cherry and chocolate flavors, but all subdued. Take a high-end Washington Syrah and lighten it up—those are the flavors here. If you value elegance and complexity, this will be just right for you.",US-Oregon:Syrah
"It smells and tastes like freshly crushed strawberries and raspberries, but sweeter, with a mild texture, medium body, soft tannins and a lingering finish. Nicely done and elegant, it blends Zinfandel, Syrah, Cabernet Franc and Merlot.",US-California:Red Blend
"Dry and acidic, yet silky, this wine has thin flavors of mint and raspberry sour candy.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Cortegaia is a thin, ruby-colored red wine with easy aromas of small berry and white cherry. The mouthfeel is compact and watery but its also refreshingly crisp. You could drink it chilled with appetizers.",Italy-Piedmont:Red Blend
"Freshly acidic and jammy in blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors, this is one of the fruitier Napa Cabs available. It's at its best now, so drink up with a nice steak.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Pretty red fruit leads the nose on this blend of 50% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre, along with brown spices, anise and chopped herbs. The forest flavors are strong, with pine sap and eucalyptus, as riper boysenberry fruit emerges with chopped oregano and thyme.",US-California:G-S-M
"Cinnamon-scented plums are written all over this. This was made to be smooth and mellow and the pliable, soft, plummy fruit notes achieve this wonderfully. The palate remains medium-bodied and balanced on this easy-drinnking red.",Austria-Burgenland:Red Blend
"Aromas of green pear, yellow apple and sage accompany a smoky whiff of flint stone. The structured, vibrant palate delivers a wonderful depth of flavors, including mature apple, white peach, orange zest, grilled rosemary and energizing mineral. It's impeccably balanced, with bright acidity.",Italy-Southern Italy:Fiano
"Dense and rich on the palate, this shows the concentration achieved in this coastal location. Snap pea, pineapple and nectarine elements combine for a harmonious whole that lingers on the finish, picking up more austere hints of wet stone. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"Fragrant and sleek, this opens with scents of blue flower, pressed powder, perfumed berry and chopped herb. The balanced, full-bodied palate delivers licorice, ripe black cherry, clove and tobacco while firm, velvety tannins lend structure and finesse.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Here's a distinctive Prosecco with aromas of peach, pear and natural rubber backed by drying minerals and crisp citrus flavors. There's a clean and precise quality here that underscores the quality of the fruit used.",Italy-Veneto:Prosecco
"Of Degani's two Amarone wines, this one offers a leaner consistency and brighter aromas of wild berry, white cherry, dried rose petal, cola and apple cider. It's a clean, polished expression, with freshness on the finish.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This wine is all about juicy blackberry and delicious ripe black plums. It is structured, with dry tannins in the background, but up front is fruity, bold and with a lightly smoky, perfumed aftertaste. It is almost ready to drink; just wait until late 2016.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"Offers heady aromas of mashed peaches, banana, blueberry and walnut. The palate matches the nose in flavors and intensity, but is lifted by the vibrant acidity and somewhat prickly texture. Finishes clean with moderate length.",France-Southwest France:Rosé
"Having never tried this producer's wines, we can only heap praise on this medium-bodied, more modern style of Rioja. Bacon, rubber and raspberry work the bouquet, while the palate is ripe and full as it pumps forth with pure red-fruit flavors. Firm and mildly tannic, with ample new oak leaving lasting flavors of vanilla, coffee and pepper. Hold for another year or so, if possible; 900 cases produced.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"Initially, this comes across as being baked out and tired, but give it time to spread out and it reveals mature, earthy, leafy aromas and a round palate with choppy, firm tannins. Earthy flavors of dried cherry, Christmas spices and chocolate yield to licorice on the finish. Drink now.",Spain-Catalonia:Red Blend
"Sweet honeysuckle, lime blossoms and honeydew show on the very flowery nose of this bottling from a newer property near the old mining town of Pozo. The sip tightens up smartly with Anjou pear and honeysuckle flavors, but it's the powerful acidity that makes for a compelling palate.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This well-made wine opens in earthy compost and black licorice before unwinding a topknot of grippy tannin. Even with its power and concentration, it offers velvety mouthfeel and an expansive wave of juicy, robust acidity, particularly on the finish, making good use of smaller additions of Cab Franc, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Merlot.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine has ripe berry fruits and balanced tannins. Fresh acidity marks the vintage and the wine is lightly textured, with an attractive smoky aftertaste. This is the first vintage for Thierry and Odile Bazin, with help from Jacques Chardat, her twin and owner of other Blaye properties.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"La Nerthe's late-ripening Mourvèdre typically shines the brightest in warm vintages, which 2008 was not. The result is a leathery, peppery wine with rather crisp, cherry-inflected fruit. Drink it over the next several years.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"This estate delivered a fine Rosso di Montalcino in 2008 and less certain results with its Brunello the same year. The issue is the sharp acidity that really makes your mouth pucker. Thankfully, the intense crispness is balanced by softer spice, black fruit and tobacco aromas.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Dominated by Chardonnay from the Côte des Blancs, this mature, mineral-textured wine is both ripe and beautifully structured. With white fruits and a floral character, it is moving into spicy territory. Roast almonds are balanced with a crisp character from the low dosage. The wine is now just ready to drink.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"This soft and smooth wine has just the right amount of smoky tannins to support the ripe, bitter cherry fruits and fresh acidity. It is still all fruit and certainly would benefit from aging, so drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley:Pinot Noir
"This smells stalky and past its prime, but it's not stinky or maderized. The palate is fleshy in feel and oily in sensation, with bitter citrus flavors and pithy notes. Neither vital nor fresh on the finish.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño
"There is a touch of minerality from the textured apple-skin flavor. The wine has a bright, lively feel to it, with green plum and grapefruit notes providing a fruity finish.",France-Alsace:Pinot Blanc
"Here's a straightforward, crisp white that opens with aromas of orange blossom and citrus. The bright palate shows apricot, lime and lemon zest alongside refreshing acidity.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:White Blend
"The producer's flagship wine, this is sourced from several Green Valley sites, including Amber Ridge and Manna. Both contribute a full-bodied wealth of packed-earth flavor in a generously layered, rich explosion of dark cherry, plum and pomegranate. Along the way, streaks of citrus and black tea provide exotic interludes.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"With a depth of ripe cherry flavor, Sean Thackrey's Wentzel Clone 777, shows concentration and weight, with a riper, fleshier and bolder character than its clonal companions grown in the same vineyard block.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"When T-L gets the mix of fruit and oak right, the wines can be deliciously hedonistic. This is a beautiful mix of cedar, vanilla and chocolate with bright boysenberry fruit, wrapped in a richly velvety texture and lingering elegantly on the finish. Drink 2012–2020.",France-Rhône Valley:Syrah
"This is an easy, fruity wine with sharp acidity that balances ripe flavors of citrus, tropical fruits, peaches, honeysuckle and vanilla bean. It finishes a little off-dry.",US-California:Pinot Grigio

"Baked and raisiny smelling, with kirsch. In a word, it's stewy. Ditto for the mouthfeel, which is chunky and heavy. Features thick black plum, herb and carob flavors and feels beefy on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Fresh, easy and crisp, this textbook Pinot Grigio offers all the fun, easy-drinking qualities you should expect from a cool-climate Italian white. Pair it with fish or tuna salad.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Grigio

"Volatile aromas of cranberry, cherry and vanilla are followed by gritty lightly sweet cranberry and green-pepper flavors that show some astringency. The concentration seems lacking.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Opens with red fruit aromas that are like a million other generic red wines, while the body has size, grab and stickiness. Flavors of cola, cherry, cassis and plum are red in nature and basically good, while the finish is candied but not overly so. An everyman's Cabernet in every sense of the word.",Argentina-Other:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This sweet and ripe tawny is touched by flavors of raisin, rich red fruit and spice. It has a smooth, toffee texture that's attractively leavened with acidity. Like all tawny Ports, it is ready to drink.",Portugal-Port:Port
"The wine is full of ripe berries, red and black fruit flavors. Soft tannins are a subtext to the main fruitiness. Although the tannins are still dry, they will soften to give a fresh wine that will age quickly. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This rich wine is still young, but packed with dark tannins and concentrated black-currant fruitiness. This hand-picked blend of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon needs to age. It will not be ready to drink before 2019. The chateau is the home of the Dubourdieu family.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Dense mossy aromas of blackberry are slightly murky. Forget about delicacy on the palate, this is full-bodied and clattering. Blackberry, cassis, black cherry and chocolate flavors finish spicy. This is at maximum ripeness. Drink through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"This unoaked Chardonnay shows admirable weight on the palate, but slightly one-dimensional, citrusy flavors. Clean and correct on the finish; drink now.",Australia-Australia Other:Chardonnay
"Produced from organically grown grapes, the wine is soft, ripe and full of fruit. Red cherries dominate, with a touch of wood from the 12 months of barrel aging. It has a bright, crisp and juicy aftertaste.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Stalky, short aromas suggest that this is raw and underripe. The palate feel confirms that impression; it's tight and choppy, with drying tannins. Roasted, gritty flavors of red fruits come with a sprinkle of cocoa, while the finish is tough in feel, spicy and ultimately mildly bitter.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"The aromas of dried herbs, fresh tobacco, rose petals, mineral, cranberry and cherry fascinate. The palate brings pillowy soft red-fruit flavors that show a sense of vibrancy and delicacy. It drinks more like Grenache than Sangiovese but after a sip or two, who cares?",US-Washington:Sangiovese
"A very pale rosé, this blend of Grenache and Syrah is medium bodied, features hints of red berries to go along with barely ripe nectarines and finishes crisp and refreshing. Drink now.",France-Rhône Valley:Rosé
"This wine starts off smelling overly ripe, with sweet orange, yellow apple flesh, peach supreme and juicy melon aromas that flood the bouquet. The mouth is full and round, but a nutty accent adds depth to the palate while medium acidity helps to lift the medium-length close.",Israel-Galilee:Chardonnay
"Pretty good, but surprisingly soft and heavy for a Santa Rita Hills Pinot Noir, with pastry-filling cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors that finish dry. Tasty, but lacks the vivacity and complexity you expect from the appellation.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"The main estate wine from Chocapalha, this is firm, with a beautiful balance between tannins and fruit. Blackberry and wood-derived spice notes are cut with acidity. It's elegant and ready to drink.",Portugal-Lisboa:Portuguese Red
"A great representative of Australian Grenache, with flavors of black fruit, road tar and raspberry liqueur fading to a palate of brambly fruit, all of which is couched in mocha and vanilla tones from toasty French oak. There's a bit of raspberry jam and a faint grip on the medium finish. Drink now.",Australia-South Australia:Grenache
"Treated now as a separate wine, rather than a second wine, with its own vineyard, Clos du Marquis has developed a dense, concentrated style. It is firm, chewy, the tannins in suspension in the rich fruit. Good aging potential.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Light, transparent and candied with underdeveloped, boring flavors and a mild chemical harshness. Barely worth a look. 40,000 cases produced.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"This wine's new leather, pressed violet and orange zest aromas unfold in the glass. The vibrant, medium-bodied palate offers red berry, baking spice and crushed herb flavors framed by bright acidity and firm, refined tannins.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
Floral and mineral tones blend nicely to create a fragrant yet polished nose. This luminous Prosecco sparkler made by vintner Maurizio Favrel delivers clean intensity and focused crispness. The mouthfeel is lean and tonic and the wine closes with a blast of citric zest.,Italy-Veneto:Prosecco
"This sparkling rosé has a floral fragrance and nutty undertones. The palate isn't very expressive, but reveals subdued strawberry and spice notes. It has a refined perlage and finishes on a dry, walnut note.",Italy-Lombardy:Sparkling Blend

"Passion fruit and pea shoots mingle easily on the nose of this medium-bodied wine. This is a fully dry and somewhat austere Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, ending on notes of white grapefruit and hints of underripe stone fruit.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a dark, big, deeply flavored Cabernet whose tannic structure strongly suggests mid- to long-term aging. Bone dry, it has flashy flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and cedar. Very fine. Best 2010–2015, if not longer in a proper cellar.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Shows some wonderful botrytis aromas of dried apricots, but also a disturbing amount of volatile acidity. If you can tolerate notes of shoe polish and nail polish, you may find this rating woefully conservative.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Riesling
"92-94 Barrel sample. Firm, richly structured, powered through with botrytis, a dried apricot and peach character, which is tight, the acidity compensating with a great vivid character.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Sumptuous, ripe and very full on the palate, this wine is dense and packed with notes of botrytis that give a strong sense of structure. This well-balanced wine shows potential to age, offering rich acacia honey and beautiful final acidity. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
Hints of wet earth marry lemony flavors with ripe and generous overtones of peach. The lemony center lends structure to the entire wine and makes for a bracing but ripe and earthy mouthful.,Austria-Kamptal:Riesling
"Fruity enough, with powerfully ripe blackberry, cherry, raspberry, currant, chocolate and licorice flavors that go on and on through the long, spicy finish. Could show greater structure, though, as it's somewhat soft, sweet and unidimensional.",US-California:Syrah
"This is a crisply fruity wine, with tight acidity and a nervy texture. The citrus character dominates, leaving room for only hints of riper red fruits. The aftertaste continues the theme of crisp acidity.",France-Bordeaux:Rosé
"There's wet river-stone freshness to this bright white wine by Rick Longoria, which also shows grapefruit blossoms, lemon balm and a touch of grassiness on the nose. There's verve on the sip, with lemongrass, kiwi and lime-skin flavors making for a very tight and green-leaning palate.",US-California:Albariño
"This Prosecco Brut has a neutral mineral streak that recalls crushed vitamin with stone fruit and some floral notes. It tastes lean and compact and although it doesn't have much staying power, it leaves the palate clean and refreshed.",Italy-Veneto:Prosecco
"A soft, juicy wine, slightly sweet in raspberries and cherries, but the finish is nicely dry. It's mellow in acids and tannins, so perfect for drinking now. Try with a great beef taco.",US-California:G-S-M
"Soft, fruity wine, with an earthy character. The wine has acidity and red fruits with a final fresh burst of ripeness. Not for aging, drink now.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"Aromas of generic red-berry fruits, leather and a drop of vinegar feed into a grabby palate with medicinal red-berry flavors. This tastes a touch herbal on a standard finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"A strong caramel aroma and flavor spoils the suggestions of fruit. They give a ripe, almost sweet character that doesn't match with the red-currant fruit flavors.",France-Bordeaux:Rosé
"With some concentration and ripe green fruits, this complex wine has a mineral structure, tangy acidity as well as a bright, crisp aftertaste. It's going to develop into a serious wine over the next two years. Drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"A fine bottle, roughly half Pinot Gris, half Gewürztraminer, from the Celilo vineyard. The PG is 25 years old; it's a blend that works really well in vintages where the vineyard gets sufficient heat, and 2009 was just about perfect. Partially barrel fermented, it sends up scents and flavors of citrus—lime and orange—with a pleasing roundness from roughly one percent residual sugar.",US-Washington:White Blend
"From the relatively hot South Coast comes a big, powerful, chewy wine, with aromas of dried blackberries, light leather, some smoke and purple flowers. The real heft is on the palate, where sour tar is laced through stewed black plums, dark chocolate and herbs like dill and oregano. The tannins are a bit stiff.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Savory herbs and peppery watercress dominate the crunchy green pear fruit on nose and palate. Citrus edges lend liveliness to the concentrated, spicy palate. Lots going on here, from the first whiff to the last, lingering echo.",Austria-Wagram-Donauland:Grüner Veltliner
"Whiffs of sweet curry spice and fennel are enticing on the nose of this earthy, rather savory Riesling from Rock Stream. Lean in profile and vibrantly acidic with a squeaky, lemony sheen, it's the perfect pairing for subtly spiced South Indian cuisine.",US-New York:Riesling
"Floral and mineral tones emerge from the nose of this white wine from Sicily. Executed in an easy and fresh style, this crisp—and slightly sweet—wine would pair with tuna salad and fried calamari.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Insolia
"A good Pinot Noir, dry and silky, with quite a bit of acidity brightening the flavors. They include ripe black cherries, cola, anise and sandalwood. Feels a bit tight, and could benefit from 1–2 years in the cellar.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Even in his less-expensive wines, such as this Columbia Valley Merlot, winemaker Charlie Hoppes gets excellent color extraction. Along with the color come stiff, substantial tannins; once in the mouth, however, the wine sets a different course, turning rather light and fruity. Tart cherry and wild berry flavors quickly give way to thick tannins and barrel flavors of baking chocolate.",US-Washington:Merlot
"An herbal, vegetal wine, its acidity is very citrusy and crisp. There is a bite of asparagus and bell pepper.",France-France Other:White Blend
"This is the winery's least acccessible 2008 Syrah. It's too tannic and acidic to be properly appreciated, although decanting will help to unleash the massive blackberry, black currant and chocolate flavors. Cellar it through 2010 if you can.",US-California:Syrah
"Full bodied and rich, this has flavors of apple and lemon, with a warm and ripe feel that is balanced by a final mineral character. It needs several months to come together.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Although there is a little Merlot and Tannat in the wine, it is 90% Malbec. Still firmly tannic, it is concentrated and spicy. It has a dark dry texture that is lifted by ripe blackberry fruit. With acidity cutting right through, the wine is nowhere near ready to drink. Wait until 2019.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"Give this lovely Pinot Noir a few hours in the decanter and serve now with your best lamb and steak entrées. It's dry, refined in the acid-tannin balance and deliciously complex, with waves of raspberries and cherries, pie crust, baking spices and toasted oak.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"From high-elevation blocks once devoted to Cabernet Sauvignon, this exceptionally crafted wine reveals a worthwhile trade-off, flavors celebratory in pear and peach. Fragrant and floral, it offers zesty acidity in Meyer-lemon form, finishing in lasting waves of more lemon.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Textured, full wine, ripe in character, full of fragrant apple and quince flavors, tightly layered. It's a concentrated wine, dense in character. The flavors go right down into the heart of the wine. Drink from 2016.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"This is a pretty, perfumed wine. It is all jammy, with only light tannins. Bright and fragrant, it is sure to develop quickly. so drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"In contrast to a nose that's more mineral than fruit, the intensity of this wine's voluptuous nectarine and yellow peach flavors surprise. It's dry in style but with a succulent fruitiness that clings delectably to the palate. Finishes long and lean with a tang of steely minerality. Drink now through 2019.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"From the major Loire producer, this fresh and fruity wine shows the light touch of the region. With red-currant fruit sliced right through with acidity, the wine is lightly textured and ready to drink.",France-France Other:Rosé
"A simple expression of Nerello Mascalese, this shows notes of bright, slightly bitter berries, with a drying mineral sensation at the back.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nerello Mascalese
"Earth, mud and wet clay are laid against a ripe black raspberry frame on this bottling from winemaker Larry Brooks. Plenty of life, zest and lift enliven the beautifully spiced palate, with bright red cherries, cranberries and purple flowers cut by a line of pencil-lead minerality and a savory fennel element.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A medium-bodied Pinot Noir that is quite sophisticated, despite the California AVA labeling. It has lots of cherry-berry flavors, great balance, velvety texture and long finish. It is substantial in flavor, smooth, and complete.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Very rich and extracted, with massive flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants that taste like they were baked into a pastry, and sprinkled with cocoa, anise, vanilla and a touch of salt and black pepper. Delicious and forward, and should hold steady over the next six years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"There are slight accents of chocolate and licorice here that sit over a solid core of cherries and blackberries. The wine (a 60-40 blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet) is rich and succulent in the mouth and would pair nicely with tomato, ricotta and sausage pasta.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Already showing a bit of evolution in its bricking color and aromas of dried cherries and brown sugar, this should be consumed over the next couple of years. It's still reasonably round and supple, with an admirably silky finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Pinot Noir
"From a region and producer more widely known for Chenin Blanc comes this very drinkable Petite Sirah with chewy blue fruit, coffee, toasty coconut and oak. There's enough structure and girth to age a while, so pair it in a few years with roasted or braised meats, a giant slab of steak or any other suitably hearty meal.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"Coming from a reliable vineyard in the Los Alamos Valley, this wine presents aromas of dried violet, blackberry, leather and espresso. Brooding dried-cherry fruit directs the palate, which benefits further from roasted game and crushed oregano and thyme. The tannins are still prominent.",US-California:Syrah
"Smoky, charred-oak aromas and flavors streak through this otherwise smooth, ripe and moderately fruity wine. It is full bodied and firmly tannic but not coarse.",US-California:Sangiovese
"Fermented in stainless steel, this is a lip-smacking wine with succulent citrus flavors of lemon and grapefruit. For those who love high-acid white wines, with some snap to their flavors, this is a good choice.",US-Oregon:Pinot Gris
"This elegant and tightly wound Grenache shows hints of black plum, boysenberry and blackberry alongside dried rose petal, gravel and sagebrush scents. The palate is effusively floral, with lilac and lavender flavors accenting an exotic backdrop of damson plum. The structure is firm and the acidity judicious.",US-California:Grenache
"With a touch of herbaceousness and a rounded texture, this is a simple and fruity wine. Light chalkiness in the texture indicates the only complexity.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Alvarinho and Sauvignon Blanc in the blend of this wine give it a crisp, herbal freshness that's broadened out by fermentation in new French oak. So it is both fresh and rich, full of citrus as well as yellow fruit flavors. It's still young and should be aged, so drink from 2017.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese White
"From its inky black color, you can tell that this is a big wine, and one sip confirms that impression. This is dry, full bodied and tannic, with explosive blackberry and raisin flavors as well as an edge of crisped beef. It's a little rustic, and the sweet fruit suggests pairing it with barbecue and roasted meat.",US-California:Red Blend
"Kirsten's Feinherb, or gently sweet bottling, maintains a firm foundation of stoniness, but also embraces softer, less angular dimensions of spring blossom and peach. High-toned acidity brighten and lifts the palate through a long finish. Drink now through 2021.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"This basic Tempranillo has many good things to offer. Although a touch heavy and oaky on the nose, it's generous and congruent. Initial flavors of raw wood and campfire settle down and are replaced by dark-berry fruit notes. On the finish, this is woody, with powerful berry and cherry notes in support.",Spain-Central Spain:Tempranillo
"A 100% varietal wine, this is dry and in balance, made in a bigger fuller style that presents as lush and plush on the palate. Apricot and peach offer a ripe succulence of fruit as a touch of oak integrates well into the background.",US-California:Viognier
"Full in the mouth, this is a soft caramel and orange zest-flavored wine. It has light acidity, although probably not enough to give a balance. The aftertaste brings pepper and spice.",France-Provence:Rosé
"This is deliciously crisp and steely, with an apple flavor and the weight of citrus and grapefruit. It has a minerally, chalky feel, and then the wine rounds out, with crisp fruit on the finish.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"A fine Cabernet, dry and balanced. It's rich in blackberries, anise and currants, with an herbaceousness that grounds it. Food-friendly, and totally drinkable now.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lemon peel, brioche and raspberry aromas take the lead on this pale pink wine. It drinks quite sweet for a brut but still delivers enjoyment with its raspberry flavors.",US-Washington:Rosé
"This blend of Pinot Noir, Chenin Blanc, French Colombard and Chardonnay has poise. It's dry to slightly sweet, with a brisk scour of acidity to lift the lime, orange and vanilla flavors.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"Basically a high-alcohol fruit bomb, with jammy flavors of raspberries and cherries. The heat from 15.5% alcohol gives it a chili pepper burn. Defines that style, for those who like it.",US-California:Zinfandel
"A flinty note appears first, but juicy pear and ripe lemon take over. This wine is zippy, refreshing and defined on the palate. A lovely bitter background of pith provides just the right balance and a great canvas for rich food. It has an appealingly clean and dry finish.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"Full, creamy, lightly toasted aromas give way to a mature, mellow palate that's a bit flaccid. Nutty flavors suggest papaya and melon, while the finish is low on acidity and thus more flat than ideal.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Chardonnay
"For those who like their Cabernets in a drier style. An elegant wine of considerable finesse, with modest alcohol framing berry, currant, cocoa and herb flavors. Grows more attractive and complex as it breathes in the glass.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A mad scientist's blend of 32% Syrah, with smaller amounts of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Petite Sirah and “other,” this wine is rustic, with a thin palate and not much in the way of fruit.",US-California:Red Blend
"With its high-toned, herbal and toasty style that sets it apart from the crowd, this distinctive Chardonnay may not be to everyone's taste. Shows lots of oak and powdered dry spices on the finish to accent the custardy-lemony fruit. Should age well and might surprise you in five years.",Australia-Western Australia:Chardonnay
"This is the 33rd vintage of this landmark Zinfandel, which, since it's a blend that includes just 74% Zinfandel in it, isn't technically Zinfandel at all. Whatever. It's just plain delicious, old-vine, succulent juice. Jammy, juicy, vibrant and tight, it has a long life ahead.",US-California:Zinfandel
"A deep mauve in color, so much it could be mistaken for a light red wine, this wine offers baked cherry, warm plum fruit and a touch of iron on the nose. Cherry and plum skins mesh with ripe raspberries on the palate, which tastes good but is fairly heavy in style for a pink wine.",US-California:Syrah
"With its superripe aromas of honey, melon and spice, this is a mouthfilling, sweet wine. It's round, without any sharp edges, yet maintains German Riesling's unique minerality and cut on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2020.",Germany-Rheingau:Riesling
"Shows plenty of Chardonnay character, with ripe tropical fruit, peach, buttered toast and vanilla flavors, and a creamy texture. Nothing complicated or fancy going on, just a slightly ripe wine that many Chard fans will like.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This wine is buttery and toasty, with sourdough on the nose alongside a hint of clementine pith. The palate is a creamy blend of mango, pineapple, sourdough and sweet cream flavors, with a slightly nutty finish.",US-Virginia:Chardonnay
"This wine pulls everything together for great enjoyment: vivid, fresh fruit aromas and a dash of oak spice, deep and layered fruit flavors like ripe but tangy black cherries, and a powerful but soothing texture that carries along all those flavor impressions through a long finish. Best now through 2020.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Musky, heady notes of ripeness move within the pear scent of this serious Federspiel. Their richness is countered by grapefruit peel that gives verve and nerve to the entire wine, corsetting its ripeness with delicious citric acidity. There is a phenolic dimension, too, but that fizzling citrus freshness is just so much fun. This will stay fresh and exciting for a long time. Drink from 2016.",Austria-Wachau:Riesling
"With black currant fruits dominant, this is an inherently fruity wine. The juicy feel makes the wine seem light, not yet quite connecting between fruit and a very dry tannic texture. Give it until 2016.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A ridiculously hedonistic bottle of Syrah, this hits you first with its heady aromas of strong black olive, tobacco and bacon, then seduces you further with layers of rich berry fruit topped by Syrah-proper pepper. Blended with Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot and fairly high in alcohol (15.5%) this is one for those who love good Syrah.",US-California:Syrah
"Aromas of peach, mineral, candle wax and fennel lead to medium-bodied, textured flavors. There's a pleasing sense of tension between the fruit and acid.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"Hobo's Zins are almost always among the most balanced and elegant out there, while preserving the variety's spicy, briary personality. This lovely single-vineyard bottling is dry and refined, showing complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, blueberries and spices. Drink now.",US-California:Zinfandel
"The white grapevines at Carvalhas are located at the top of the hills that faces the Douro River, which helps retain acidity. This mineral and floral wine is textured,with a crisp citrus and ripe apricot flavor. It is still young and will be better from late 2016.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese White
"Surprisingly tannic, considerably more so than the wonderful '05. There's a sting of astringency that shuts down the palate and emphasizes the dryness. Underneath are the blackberries, black currants and grilled meat of a fine red wine. The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Malbec. Now–2012.",US-California:Red Blend
"Perfumed, soapy aromas of berry fruits and grainy oak announce a palate that comes up a bit empty. Flavors of chocolaty oak and caramel overshadow generic berry fruit, while this is firm on the finish, with herbal overtones and a note of olive.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Winemaker Sabrine Rodems uses the winery's estate vineyard to show cinnamon, Bing cherries, root beer and mace aromas. The flavors of anise, raspberry juice and Earl Grey tea are spruced up by a generous acidity that gives the herb-leaning wine exciting zing.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A best-of blend from several of the producer's vineyard sites, this wine explodes in flavor and complexity as though celebrating each site's individual beauty and potential. Black pepper and crisp orange and pomegranate flavors show through its layered and focused texture—a savory package with a seemingly endless finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A ripe, dense wine, this has powerful fruit and a serious long-term future. It is rich with yellow fruits with a generous, creamy texture, and tight with minerality. This gorgeous wine will certainly age well. Drink from 2024.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"A blend of 50-50 Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this is a rich wine from Grand Cru vineyards on the Montagne de Reims. It also structured, with a strongly mineral texture that is tight and concentrated. The wine, with its light tannins from the red wine in the blend, is ready to drink.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Blackberry, violet and leather aromas rise from the glass in this firm Nero d'Avola. Mature black cherry, mocha, licorice and tobacco flavors are framed by fine-grained tannins on the palate. Enjoy through 2021.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nero d'Avola
"A sophisticated wine that shows the Douro structure while also bringing out great ripe swathes of black fruits. There is a fine balance, good depth of flavor, with a tannic character that promises aging.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"Cherry and cassis aromas are a touch flat and jammy. This shows grabby tannins as well as loamy, earthy, lightly bitter flavors of black fruits. The finish lumbers along with size and tannic grip, but overall this blend of 65% Tempranillo, 25% Graciano and 10% Garnacha shows well.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"The mid-14% alcohol gives this wine a solid fruit core, much like a California Pinot. Cherry cola flavors hit the palate immediately, then quickly fall away. Bottle shock maybe, but the wine doesn't show the stuffing of past versions.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This pretty Pinot Noir is drinking well now, but has the depth to last for a while. It's succulent and forward in black and red currant, Dr. Pepper, clove, smoky vanilla and pepper flavors. Really a beautiful, alluring wine.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Rooty aromas of blackberry and baked plum share space on the bouquet with vanilla, smoke and coconut scents. This feels lush, round, firm and tannic, with profound depth. Flavors of blackberry, baking spices, chocolate and pepper finish toasty, with massive black-fruit leftovers. This is a powerful specimen to drink 2017–2030.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Hard spice, fresh-cut oak and dark berry aromas make for a serious, stout bouquet. This is bright and lively in the mouth, with mouthfilling tannins and flavors of boysenberry and vanilla. A quick, slightly hot finish is aggressive but sturdy.",Chile-Maule Valley:Carignan
"Aromas of tropical fruit, dried hay and mint lead the nose. The bright palate offers grapefruit, pineapple and unripe yellow peach. Brisk acidity gives it a breezy finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon
"Named after the traditional boat used on the Douro River, this dessert wine, made from 50% Tempranillo, 34% Touriga Nacional and 16% Tinta Cao, is a muddy brown-red color and shows aromas of concentrated raisin and turned earth. Pipe smoke, prunes, kirsch and caramel flavors combine for a very lasting finish, allowing this to function much like Scotch and work well with cigars.",US-California:Port
"Applesauce and fruit salad are rather strange, unconvincing aromas for Merlot, and the palate of plum and wild berry is big, broad and lunky. Jammy on the back end, with herbal berry flavors on the finish. Acceptable red wine but nothing special.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Merlot
"With its aromas of very pure, crisp fruits, this ripe wine from the great 2002 vintage is so complete. It has flavors of dried fruits, apricots and pear, and a texture that fills the mouth with a tight, mineral character. Impressive now, it does need to age, or even be decanted before serving.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"With some good concentration and hints of the wood aging, this ripe, full wine has both fruit and tannins. A stalky, black currant element adds texture as well as a fresh aftertaste. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A soft, warm textured wine. Its fresh citrus, red apples and orange zest act as a foil to the full-bodied structure. At the end, it's all lightness and freshness.",France-Alsace:Pinot Blanc
"This is a soft, easy wine, with sweet black raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. Drink now with a nice homemade cheeseburger.",US-California:Syrah
"A little tough and gritty around the edges, a rustic wine rich in extracted cherry and blackberry jam flavors. Plenty of strong tannins and zippy acidity too. Feels unresolved, and the question is whether cellaring will result in improvement. Try after 2012.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A fine, rewarding young Zinfandel whose massively rich fruit is balanced and grounded with a firm structure. Floods the mouth with the essence of ripe raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, black pepper and meaty-salty notes of bacon. Then those Dry Creek tannins kick in, with their slightly coarse earthiness. Ready now.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Grapefruit blossoms, scratched pink grapefruit skin and Granny Smith apples show on the delicate nose of this blend of 54% Sémillon, 43.5% Sauvignon Blanc and 2.5% Orange Muscat. It's light, bright and easy on the palate, with cut green apple and lime juice flavors, making it perfect to pair with plenty of lighter foods.",US-California:White Blend
"Full bodied, buttery and spicy in aroma and oaky in flavor, this wine has a big, bold personality from the first whiff through the lingering finish. Complexity and body are its strong suits rather than fruitiness.",US-California:Viognier
"This robust red opens with aromas suggesting forest floor, truffle, pressed violet and used leather. The hefty palate shows scorching alcohol, licorice and a hint of raisin but not much fruit richness. Clenching tannins leave an extremely astringent finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Exotically floral on the nose, the prettiness of this wine follows through on the palate, salty and high in acidity, with a tang of lemon peel and lemon verbena. Focused and fresh, it has body and weight within that context, ultimately finding a balance that persists on the lengthy finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Gorgeously aromatic with notes of freshly pressed apple, wildflower honey and tangerine peel, this is a richly textured, almost creamy, ice wine. Intense flavors of honey and fresh apple ripple on the palate, with striking lemon acidity that lends a squeaky clean finish.",Canada-Ontario:Riesling

"Big, full-bodied wine, the great tannins dominating the underlying red fruit. It's firmly concentrated, intense, a powerhouse of dense texture and obviously a wine that will need aging. Give it 5–6 years.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Vibrant aromas of black raspberry, black cherry, cigar box, wet soil and dried oregano are reminiscent of classic Bordeaux in this blend of 34% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Cabernet Franc, 9% Malbec and 9% Petit Verdot. Rounded red fruits show on the front and finish of the sip, but the midpalate is layered with olive, crushed pepper, marjoram and black tea.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Medium intense aromas of tangerine citrus and crushed yellow flowers transition to flavors of dried grass, red apple and a touch of mushroom powder. Drink now.",South Africa-Western Cape:Chenin Blanc
"One of the few varietal bottlings produced in the state, this concrete-fermented wine brings notes of straw, wet stone, herbs and citrus zest. It's tart and mouthwatering with lemony acidity and a textured feel, screaming out for shellfish to be served alongside it.",US-Washington:Grüner Veltliner
"The winery held back this brut-style wine for eleven years. Even at this great age, the wine tastes young and vibrant in acidity, with rich strawberry, orange, lime and yeast flavors, finished with sweet vanilla. Tastes beautiful now, but extraordinary as it is, it should gain traction over the next ten years.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"A bit hot and heavy. Alcohol gives it a glyceriney sweetness, while the flavors themselves are very ripe in blackberry and cherry pie filling, with a superripe finish of prunes.",US-California:Syrah
"A tough, gritty wine, dry and tannic, with some decent berry and cherry flavors. It's the kind of red wine that will happily wash down a cheeseburger.",US-California:Red Blend
"This is rich both on the nose and on the palate. Full and rounded, it has spice and currant flavors. There is a burnt-almond bitterness that marks the finish.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"This is an eccentric Pinot Noir that's dry, strong and tart in acidity, with moderate alcohol and shows an interesting petrol, resinous note. The silky frames sour cherry candy, spice and sandalwood flavors. Drink now.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Failla reaches into this new appellation within Napa Valley for this vineyard-designated Chard. It's a little heavier and softer than the Chardonnays from Sonoma County usually associated with the winery. Very rich in tropical fruits and pears, while the oak is lavish in vanilla and buttered toast. Drink now.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Plump blackberry, dark strawberry, dried herbs and baking spice show on the nose of this well-rounded and easily likable bottling. The palate mixes fleshy red and purple fruit with a strong chaparral component in the midpalate. The firm grippy texture makes this a more serious Zinfandel than most.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Savory tones of pressed apples and pears build in spice and concentration on the palate of this Chardonnay, layered in decadent swathes of caramel and cream. It's rich and round in mouthfeel with bold alcohol and body, but balanced with lemony acidity on the finish.",US-New York:Chardonnay
"There is a lightly toasty character in this wine that gives it a round, full texture. Spice goes along with the green and white-fruit flavors to make an intensely fruity wine that hints at a New World style. Drink now. This is one of 15 Bordeaux chateaus by Crus and Domaines de France.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Barbaresco Bernardot is a gorgeous wine with full intensity and brightness colored by soft aromas of black cherry, chocolate and softly roasted hazelnut. Let this wine age five more years at a minimum so that those tannins unwind and soften.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Full, creamy and soft, this is a rich Champagne, very much a food wine. It has great ripe swathes of peach and pineapple flavors, rounded by toast. While 2000 is not a vintage for aging, this opulent Champagne may be the exception.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Barrel-fermented , this nonetheless offers clean, crisp flavors of pear and pineapple on the palate. The fruit lingers through a medium-sized body that picks up steam on the finish, delving into richer notes of fig and lemon curd. The fruit is 100% estate.",US-California:Chardonnay
"A light, sweet wine that has a faint prickle and candied-strawberry flavors. It is ready to drink.",Portugal-Vinho Verde:Rosé
"Made from Syrah, this pink-colored rosé is ripe and full. Full-on strawberry flavors have a bitter edge as well as acidity. It needs to be drunk now.",France-Southwest France:Rosé
"Soft and still fairly tannic at the age of four–plus, with the herbal taste that often marks Alexander Valley Cabs. Yet there's enough blackberry, currant and cocoa richness to satisfy. Should develop over the next six years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a lovely rendering of Syrah from this outstanding Walla Walla vineyard. In terms of depth of flavor and range of detail, it's a fascinating wine sure to provide an evening's pleasure. Sassafras, spiced and cured meat, licorice, espresso, black cherry and cassis whirl through the palate, with excellent concentration and length.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Spaghetti con vongole (clams) is an appropriate pairing partner for this luminous white wine from northern Italy. Aged only in stainless steel, this Soave Classico delivers clean aromas of peach, citrus and honey.",Italy-Veneto:Garganega

"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and a drop of Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of red currant, cedar, toasted notes and a whiff of exotic spice.

"Toasty, tarry aromas include dark berry and baked plum notes. This offers ample tartaric acidity to cut the wine's weight, while flavors of berry, tea, mint and herbs lead to a good tasting but hollow feeling finish.",Chile-Maule Valley:Carmenère
"Expensive for what you get. The nose is a weird mix of salami and sweetness, and the palate is a syrupy, globular blend of cloying oak, caramel syrup and candied banana. Way too much wood and vanilla here, and not nearly enough balance or purity.",Spain-Catalonia:White Blend
"The RR wines receive special packaging, but little technical information is provided. Though this is a 2013, it's of a piece with the winery's 2014 Pinots, which is to say that lemony acids and a plethora of herbal components overshadow the fruit. There are hints of wild berry, and a finish with light suggestions of chocolate.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Textured yet full bodied, this is a rich wine from a small 17-acre estate. The toast note shows strongly, but it's still in balance, resulting in yeast and croissant flavors as well as tropical fruits. For aging over the next 2–3 years.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Tiny percentages of Syrah and Petite Sirah play minor roles in this vineyard-designate. They add to the soft, juicy and focused concentration of big-boned red fruit, cinnamon and tangy, tart acidity.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Aromas of charcoal and flavors of barbecue sauce make it pretty clear what to eat when drinking this bold, spicy and assertive wine. Moderate tannins give just enough texture to support this medium-bodied wine.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A very subtle hint of oak transmutes the super-fresh varietal notes into gentler stone-fruit notions of ripe yellow plum and apricot. The leesy texture of the wine lends body and weight, while the expert handling of oak adds a layer of complexity to the slumbering, ripe fruit underneath. This is delicious now but will get even better.",Austria-Südsteiermark:Sauvignon Blanc
"Starts out varietally correct, with zest in the mouth and citrusy, green aromas. Time doesn't really help it along; the lime and grapefruity crispness is surface-level. Turns more pithy and less focused as it airs out. Drink immediately before it fades.",Chile-Maule Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"This hugely ripe Chardonnay is just a little too big for absolute balance. Any more powerful, and it would be over the line. As it is, it flirts with it, with gobs of jammy apricots, yellow pears, citrine and Meyer lemondrop, as well as barrel influences ranging from creamy lees to buttered toast, roasted hazelnuts and smoky honey. The alcohol is over 15%.",US-California:Chardonnay
"A rich, pineapple-flavored wine with a touch of smoke and roasted almonds, very citrusy at the finish. It's crisp, perfumed and fresh. Screwcap.",Austria-Niederösterreich:Riesling
"Smoky leaf tobacco aromas are typical of young Cabernet Franc. And this wine, aged only in tank, is certainly much too young. It's full of brittle tannins and acidity that needs to soften. Wait until late 2015 before drinking.",France-Loire Valley:Cabernet Franc
"A winner from a consistently excellent winery. A distinctive tropical fruit aroma leads to lively apple and lemon flavors. It's balanced, complex, and lingering on the finish. Try with soft cheeses or shellfish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"A Merlot and Malbec dominated Bordeaux-style blend with a splash of 7% Syrah added to the mix, it's lightly aromatic with notes of herbs, plum and blueberry. The fruit flavors are light in style, with quite firm tannins that need some time to unwind.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The subtle nose features a medley of citrus fruits. Zesty lemon, grapefruit and tangerine flavors persist across the palate. Juicy and refreshing with an attractive midpalate creaminess adding weight and complexity. Smooth and long, with a nice mineral kick on the finish.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"Plum-jam-flavored wine, this is very sweet, rich and very direct. The freshness is here, but this is more about the dense, superripe fruits.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"While 1976 in Germany was a benchmark vintage, known for ripe, intensely flavored Rieslings, this auslese feels frail and faded at nearly 39 years old. Still, it offers a fascinating glimpse at Riesling's intensely mineral character, once the ebullience of its fruit and perfume have faded. Tasting now only a touch off dry, it's intensely dusty, saline and mineral, with a lean, slightly astringent finish.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"The current edition of this nonvintage rosé is a blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Bone-dry, tart and tangy, it's a versatile, food-friendly wine, with flavors of tart citrus flesh and rind. A dash of white pepper marks the long, full-bodied finish.",US-Oregon:Rosé
"From the producers of Domaines Ott, this is an attempt at an entry-level rosé. It's plump in the mouth, delviering round, canteloupe and citrus flavors, but finishes a bit soft.",France-Provence:Rosé
This wine comes from 35-year-old vines at French Creek Vineyard. Light aromas of spice and cream lead to a creamy palate marked with lighter-styled apple and stone-fruit flavors. It's a very pretty expression of the variety.,US-Washington:Chardonnay
"Full-bodied and firm yet rounded in mouthfeel and generous in fruit flavors, this wine strikes a harmonious balance that makes it irresistible. It boasts blueberry, black cherry, dark chocolate and cinnamon flavors, its plush texture carrying them long into the finish.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Roasted, leathery berry aromas are dense, complex and include a tarry note of fresh asphalt. This Carmenère-led blend is both chewy and deep, complete with fine-grain tannins. Rooty cherry and cassis flavors are spicy, while a full-feeling finish tastes of cola, pepper, herbs and spice. Drink through 2024.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Red Blend
"Dusty, generic plum and berry aromas are highly regular. This Malbec is chunky in feel, without much precision. Oaky buttery slightly greasy berry flavors finish hot and creamy, with little to no elegance or cut.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Despite a reported alcohol level that's moderate for its genre, this feels nicely full and rounded on the palate. Hints of vanilla and sarsaparilla accent flavors of cherries, plums and chocolate, while the tannins are supple and creamy in texture. Drink now–2018.",Australia-South Australia:G-S-M
"Organic vintner Mauro Drocco presents a tangy and spicy red wine with cassis, red currant and cured meat. It ends with freshness but also some candied fruit.",Italy-Piedmont:Dolcetto
"Scented with iris, violet, rose, perfumed berry and a balsamic note, this shows remarkable balance and finesse for such a scalding vintage. The juicy palate delivers crushed black cherry, black raspberry, chopped mint and anise wrapped in polished tannins. It's already delicious but will be even better in another year or two. Drink 2017–2023.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Truffle and dirt arise aromatically from this wine, a structured and juicy offering of red and black berry, tobacco and black tea. Lush and complex, the wine jumps from the glass and is a nice example of the beauty that can be coaxed from a challenging vintage.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a good, brisk Sauvignon Blanc whose citrus and tropical fruit, peach and vanilla flavors are delicious. Bright acidity makes it feel clean and zesty.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Nutty with baked peach and pineapple notes, this wine is medium-bodied but surprisingly restrained on the palate, nearly unresolved. It grows more citrusy in the glass, with a spark of lemon zest on the finish.",US-California:Viognier
"Extra rich, ripe and round , this offers a full fruitiness that explodes in the mouth. Tannins and structure are all there, although the main thrust of this wine is the balance between this tension and the generous fruits that are developing. Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of red currant, plum, cedar, bell pepper and toasted oak. The palate offers dried black cherry, grilled herb, espresso and vanilla alongside ripe but rather fleeting tannins.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"The bouquet is redolent of stewed tomato, dried spices and lean red fruit, while the palate is thin and tastes like strawberries mixed with oak. The finish is the definition of light and easy, yet here a hint of pickled vegetable arises.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Pinot Noir
"A blend of Sangiovese, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this offers aromas that recall ripe plum, sun-baked earth and black pepper. The round, ripe palate doles out fleshy black cherry, cinnamon, mocha and a confectionary note alongside lithe tannins.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"A big, bold Zin, with a kick of peppery spices. Really front-loaded with wild berry, currant, cherry pie and sweet tobacco flavors. Nothing subtle about this barbecue-friendly powerhouse.",US-California:Zinfandel
"The first mouthful reveals a wine that is just plain opulent and rich. Only on the second taste do dense tannins push their way in, a structure that is concentrated, dry and tight. The fruit flavors are also forward, strawberry juice touched with cranberry juice dryness. This could age well, give it 4–5 years.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Herbaceous aromas and flavors dominate this medium-bodied wine. It shows assertive herb and savory aromas, pungent lemon and celery flavors and a very crisp, dry finish.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"There's a generous, sunny quality to this Italian Pinot Grigio that comes across with ripe aromas of apricot, melon and Golden Delicious apple. There's a fullness to the mouthfeel as well with soft, slightly sweet fruit flavors at the end.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Grigio
"Aromas of baked plum, vanilla, raisin and a confectionary note emerge in the glass. On the palate, notes of ground black pepper and chocolate accent the core of black cherry and raspberry compote alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.",Italy-Veneto:Red Blend
"Aged for a year in wood, this smooth, rich wine is structured and packed with ripe black-plum fruit. It is bold and generous with the fruits balanced by both acidity and dense tannins. The wine is just ready to drink although it will be better from 2017.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"Wood aging and ripe fruit combine to make a structured and rich wine that has good potential. It's solid, concentrated with all the minerality and texture of the Douro. With vineyards on the high plateau north of the Douro, the wine has a cool edge that keeps it fresh, despite the alcohol.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"Char and blackberry flavors on the palate are as brooding asthe dark soil, oak and berry fruit on the nose. Tannins speak louder than flavors in this wine; it's black, and with a little more lushness, could be a beauty.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Merlot
"This opens with a gaseous, sulfuric scent followed by aromas of peach pit, apricot, green apple and wet stones. The palate is lean and zesty, while flavors of lemon, tangerine and nectarine finish with a blend of raw acidity and oaky vanilla.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Chardonnay
"Chunky and rubbery smelling at first, then out comes black fruit, oak and licorice in spades. This is a modern, dark wine from old Mencía vines that's very tasty and rolls across the palate with ease. It's a little syrupy and very ripe, with hints of herbs on the finish as well as cocoa and fig. Drink now through 2013.",Spain-Northern Spain:Mencía
"This is a strong, full-bodied rosé with ripe, jammy strawberry and raspberry flavors that finish off dry with fruity essence.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Front-loaded with cherries, violets, red currants and mocha, this Merlot isn't just about flavor. It also has depth and length, in other words a complexity that lifts it above the average. It's already throwing some sediment, suggesting that even a year or two in the bottle will help it mellow.",US-California:Merlot
"There's a very good wine in here, but the winery has released it far too early, which shifts the burden of cellaring to the buyer. Right now it's all primary fruit, acidity and oak. But the fruit is beautifully layered in tiers of roasted blackberries, grilled cherries and cola, and the oak is splendid. This dry, silky wine desperately needs to be held until at least late 2010, and should drink well through 2014.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Made with Nero d'Avola, this bright, pretty wine offers juicy red cherry, strawberry and blackberry sensations along with notes of black pepper and mineral. Fresh and savory, this is made to be enjoyed young.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nero d'Avola
"The name Mãe translates as “mother vine” and this wine, made from the oldest vines on the estate, delves back into the roots of winemaking by using traditional open fermenting tanks and long wood aging. It is concentrated and ripe, still full of tannins and a powerful, dry and smoky structure. Age this wine for several years and drink from 2020.",Portugal-Lisboa:Portuguese Red
"Produced from the oldest vines on the Bourgeois family estate, this is a flint and steel-textured wine. The fruit is still coming through the intense texture of this complex wine. The hints of apple and grapefruit will develop as the wine ages. Unlike so many Sancerre, this needs to age. Drink from 2018.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Espresso, blackberry and black olive flavors all come together on the palate of this medium- to full-bodied Shiraz. Hints of leather, plum, menthol and spice add complexity to the aromas, while only a touch of warmth on the finish from its 15% alcohol keeps this from an excellent rating. Drink now.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
"Peach and grapefruit pith, earth and lemon mix on nose and palate to create a deep-fruited wine with midpalate concentration. The body is fresh and rich and just dry, bordered and contained by that enticing grapefruit zestiness. The finish is clean.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"There's plenty of toasty oak flavor (the wine spent 27 months in barrel) along with pretty raspberry and cherry fruit. Dark notes come in with the tannins—smoke and char, along with a coconut kick to the finish.",US-Washington:Merlot
"This Port was bottled unfiltered which means there are the right conditions for it to age. It is rich and dense with jammy black fruits and ripe tannins. Dried black plums and dates are backed up by a dry core and by fine acidity. Drink this rich wine now, but it will be much better from 2019.",Portugal-Port:Port
"Soft and easy on the nose, this wine by a newer estate suggests ripe kiwis, Key lime and a brisk minerality. Broad and approachable flavors will be inviting to many palates. Flavors of apple flesh and pear cider go down easy on a hot day.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Winemaker Bill Brousseau works to restrain the powerful ripeness that can come from one of the more famous vineyards in the appellation. This offers a nose with wound-up cranberry fruit, touches of hibiscus and rosebuds, and chipped-slate aromas. The palate shows juniper and pine-needle spice across a juicy black-cherry and black-plum core, with strong acidity and solid structure extending into a savory finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"AThe L-Block Shiraz is a broody, powerful beast meant for many years of cellaring. Right now, it shows dense black and red fruit, chocolate, black olive and oak spice. The tannins are big and savory but everything appears to be in balance. It should start to reveal its true colors in several years' time. Drink 2019–2037.",Australia-Victoria:Shiraz
"There's a strong peach-fuzz aroma enveloping this wine. It's unoaked, tasting overly rich and oily.",US-California:Viognier
"This is heavy, soft and overripe, with raisin and Port-like flavors.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"Few wineries produce an Oakville Chardonnay. This is a soft and heavy effort, with apricot and tangerine flavors.",US-California:Chardonnay

"Aromas of stone fruits and citrus are dusty and nice; so is the mouthfeel, which is fresh but shows texture and body. Watermelon, nectarine and citrus flavors finish slightly bitter but within reason.",Spain-Northern Spain:Rosado
"New winemaking and a sizable replanting effort at the producer's Spring Mountain estate are starting to show dividends in this new release, a full-bodied style true to its heritage. Bright acidity pops around a taste of pomelo and yuzu, giving the wine a zest of lemon before a caramelized finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Extraordinarily ripe and sweet in blackberries, cassis and figs, with a lovely perfume of violets and cedar, this soft, lush Cabernet, which was blended with some Petit Verdot, is so decadent now, you can hardly resist it. But it's pretty tannic, with good acidity, and has the structure to ride out the next eight years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Full-bodied and rich, this is a traditional style of Barossa Shiraz, aged in American oak hogsheads. Faint menthol or dill notes and plenty of vanilla frame plum and mulberry fruit, while hints of green peppercorn and maple syrup add interest to the long finish. Drink now–2030.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
"Layers of wet stones and smoke pervade this dry, deeply mineral wine. It's full in body, yet gossamer in mouthfeel and marked by searing lemon-lime acidity. Tightly wound still, it's a structured, complex wine likely to improve after 2018.",Germany-Nahe:Riesling
"A sure-fire crowd-pleaser, this tightly-wound Merlot comes on very Cab-like, but with red fruits more than blue or black. It opens up into a broad mid-palate, showing well-balanced nuances of olive and earth, fresh herb, pepper and licorice. Dense, textural and smoky, it's delicious now or could be cellared for another five or six years.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Blue flower, tilled soil, underbrush, tobacco and dried-cherry aromas waft from the glass of this single-vineyard bottling. The warm palate delivers raisin, prune, graphite, mocha, vanilla and a hint of orange peel alongside bracing tannins. The long finish closes on a mineral note.",Italy-Veneto:Red Blend
"Aromas of savory spice and black fruits are mild. This is wide on the palate, with a touch of acidic scour. Blackberry, sweet black currant and chocolate are the key flavors, followed by modest spice and toast on the finish. The wine is good, but low on complexity and character.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley:Syrah

One of five wineries owned by Bernadette Faure and Alain Aubert; their daughters oversee vineyards, winemaking and marketing.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Passerina is a white grape from Central Italy that has enjoyed an enormous growth in popularity and quality in recent years.

"An earthy, peppery aroma highlights this rich and generous tasting wine. It shows the wilder, more rustic side of Sangiovese's personality.",US-California:Sangiovese

Overall fruit-forward describes this best, with some of the flesh of a good stainless Chardonnay.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir

"Mixing delicate highlights of dried leaves with generous flavors of ripe berries, this appealing, open, delicious Resonance Reserve is finished at just 13.8% alcohol. It is a pretty wine, balanced and lightly annotated with caramel and milk chocolate.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot shows an uneasy mix of green coffee bean, cherry, char and meaty notes. The cherry flavors are medium bodied backed by a wall of firm, dry tannins.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A blend relying on 70% Cabernet Franc with the remainder an equal split of Malbec and Merlot, this offers a lot of raspberry tart and caramel, along with a tropical element of coconut.

"Tart aromas of sour cream, yogurt, candied lime and pressed quince show on the nose of this stylishly structured Chardonnay. The palate carries the theme forward, with pithy pink grapefruit notes, lime ade and brie rinds, showing firm tension on the tongue and bound-up energy that will keep this bottle alive for years.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Tastes as rich and sweet as a dessert pastry, with sweet vanilla oak, raspberry and cherry pie filling and cinnamon spice flavors. Somewhat one-dimensional, but tasty and smooth. Drink now.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Potent Malbec with aromas of leather, bacon, blackberry and smoke. It's thick and dense, but well balanced, with flavors of blackberry, cola, pepper and nutmeg. More smooth and easy than complex, with a long, creamy, sweet finish that cements the wine's character. Probably the best Felino Malbec to date, and a good value at 20 bucks.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Touches of balsamic vinegar, violet and wet granite lend complexity to this crisp, elegant Pinot Noir. Black cherry and plum flavors are penetrating and pristine, finishing with a fringe of dusty tannins.",US-New York:Pinot Noir
"Tart, apricot/white peach flavors offer no real hint of varietal perfume, though classic Gewurz flavors can be found in the lightly floral finish. High acid wine.",US-Oregon:Gewürztraminer

"Dark pink in color, this off-dry wine is as soft as the velvet in its name. Strawberry dominates the flavor, along with attractive acidity and a smooth, round texture. A wine for apéritifs.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"This hyper-ripe wine hits it hard in terms of power and sheer strength of fruit, making for a big, slightly sweet and one-dimensional experience bordering on Port. It's to be enjoyed carefully.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Scents of salted caramels, smoke and apple blossom make this wonderfully enticing. It's a straightforward, easygoing wine, but highlighted by fresh apple and pear notes that melt into richer, rounder flavors of nuts and cream.",US-New York:Chardonnay
"Warm, jammy and lightly herbal smelling, with an overriding aroma of blueberry compote. Fairly full and concentrated on the palate, with herb-infused flavors of dark berry and plum. Plump, warm and chewy on what amounts to a solid finish.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Briny aromas are less than fruity. This feels oily and round, with flavors of tropical fruits such as pineapple and mango set against nectarine and stone-fruit notes. Plump on the finish, with a slightly bitter aftertaste.",Spain-Northern Spain:Verdejo
"After it oozes rubber and bacon on the nose, berry fruit and mild medicinal aromas settle in. Feels full, tight and structured, with meat, black cherry and wild berry flavors. Finishes warm, chocolaty and lightly roasted. Well-made, and impressive for the price.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo

The taut palate offers dried black cherry, roasted coffee bean and bitter sage alongside grippy tannins that leave a drying, astringent finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"The Sweetwater block is the highest on the Rochioli estate, stretching into the hills. The wine is very concentrated in green apples, spicy Asian pears and insanely ripe summer peaches. It's quite oaky, with strong buttered toast notes, yet the oak is balanced with the fruit. A classy, flashy wine that drinks well now, and should develop in the bottle over the next 4–6 years.",US-California:Chardonnay

"This serious wine is still developing even after five years. It is rich, dense and concentrated with firm tannins that lie under the ripe black fruits and acidity. From vineyards to the east of Aix-en-Provence, the wine has a mineral, structured character that needs to age. Drink from 2018.",France-Provence:Provence red blend

"You know you're dealing with a great Pinot Noir when it's this delicious right out of the bottle, yet will age. This wine is enormously rich and sweet in cherries, blackberries, blueberries and cola, a wine that almost everyone will find delicious. Yet with thick tannins and brisk acidity, it has the protective structure to evolve over at least six years, and possibly longer.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Initial aromas are scratchy and piercing, but with airing this blend of Syrah, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon offers intriguing notes of vanilla, tobacco and charcoal. In the mouth, this is undeniably thick and tannic. Flavors are saturated and suggest blackberry and cassis. The finish leans toward syrupy but maintains acidity for balance. Drink through 2018.",Spain-Levante:Red Blend
"This starts out closed and tight, shut down by tannins and immaturity, but plenty of swirling reveals elusive black-licorice and blackberry notes, accented by smoky oak. The tannins really kick in toward the middle, but hard as they are, they exhibit great breed. Despite its sweet core of fruit, this is nowhere close to being ready. Give it 10 years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Smooth and clean, with a soft, buttery style. This broadly fruity, immediately enjoyable Merlot is clearly intended for near-term enjoyment.",US-Washington:Merlot

"Ripe, juicy peach and pink grapefruit flavors are accented with subtle mineral tones on this easy drinking, yet noteworthy Riesling. Dry and full bodied in style, it's lushly textured, with a bristle of lemon-pith astringency on the finish.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"As befits this ripe and forward vintage, this special cuvée is rich to the point of voluptuousness—a generous expression of cherry and plum fruit broadly displayed across the palate. The oak treatment (17 months in three-quarters new French barrels) brings smooth and lightly buttery accents of caramel and chocolate. It's a sexy wine that seems best for near- and medium-term consumption.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir

"With strong fruity aromas like lemon and lime, this wine starts off bold and then turns more mellow and smooth on the palate. It has light vanilla accents and a creamy texture.",US-California:Chardonnay
"What this 100% Merlot lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in the sheer power of its fruit. It's rich and spicy in black cherry, milk chocolate, red licorice and oak, after being aged for 20 months in 100% new French barrels. With thick but refined tannins, it's drinkable now.",US-California:Merlot
"Another 100% Syrah from the producer aged in two-thirds new French oak for 18 months, this has a dullness around the fruit, a sourness almost, that is not otherwise sparked by its notes of meat and gunpowder.",US-California:Syrah
"92-94 A luxurious wine, acidity and sweet plum fruits rolling together into a fine, beautiful structure. It has toughness, to be sure, while it is the glamorous surface that is immediately attractive.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Waves of French oak, coconut, espresso and menthol lead the nose. The dense, extracted palate offers raspberry jam, vanilla, toasted oak and kirsch alongside packed, fine-grained tannins. The warmth of alcohol and a leathery note signal the finish. Nebbiolo purists may find the new wood sensations excessive but if you're into concentrated, oak-driven wines, you'll especially enjoy this.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo

It has layers of fruit, a bit of smoke, and lots of fine tannins that pile up for a rich mouthfeel and lingering finish.",US-California:Red Blend
"Reticent herb, mineral, barrel spice and red-apple aromas are followed by concentrated fruit flavors. The tannins this vineyard is often known for are kept well in check.",US-Washington:Merlot

"Like almost all of Reverie's Cabernets on release, this one needs time in the cellar. Tasted in fall 2011, it's tight and grapey, with blackberry jam flavors girded by a firm, stony minerality and sweet, but hard, tannins. Give it 6–8 years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"The vineyard is in the cooler Green Valley, and this Pinot shows its terroir in the vital acidity that brightens pure, intense cherry, blueberry and blackberry fruit flavors. It's an elegant wine, but tannic. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This 60-40 Greco and Malvasia blend is among the most representative quality white wines from the Puglia region. Aromas of pear, stone fruit and white mineral are backed by creamy warm-climate nuances and a thick consistency. The wine is not oak fermented or aged although it tastes as if it had been.

"A delicious, complex Merlot, although all the parts haven't come together and it needs time in the cellar.

"Already impressive, this wine shows great fruit for the vintage as well as structure.

"Juicy black cherry and black berry take center stage in this blend of Montelpulciano and Sangiovese.

"Aged 100% in new wood, this is a wine produced as a joint venture between California vintner Paul Hobbs and Cahors producer Bertrand Vigouroux. It is a major, powerful statement, rich and dense. The texture smoothes out the natural structure of Cahors Malbec to give a silky wine, the tannins in suspension in the black plum fruits. It will be better from 2017.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"If you enjoy a really pungent, intensely grassy Sauvignon, then you'll love this wine, but for many consumers it will be too much. The descriptor “cat pee” may sound unkind, but it's apropos in this case, balanced by passion fruit and a long, lemony finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon Blanc
"Oaky notes of buttered toast, dried apple slices and baked peach are upfront in the bouquet of this wine. The palate is similarly rich and round, but with ample acidity to keep it from falling completely flat. Flavors of orange creamsicle and spiced apple linger on the close.",France-France Other:Chardonnay

"Smells ashy, but gets better as it airs, showing ripe, flashy raspberry fruit and a coating of sweet oak.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Smells a bit cheesy and leathery, with mint and slightly chemical berry aromas. Chewy in feel, with buttery flavors of red berry and chocolate. Tastes oaky, minty and forced, but overall it's not a bad wine given the price and subpar vintage.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"The nose on this wine from the longtime Santa Ynez Valley producer is a bit faint, with wet lawn and lemon most apparent. The palate is more sensation-based than flavor-driven, all about light texture and simmering acidity, with green apple and lime skin elements.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"A fruity wine, full of red cherries and plenty of acidity. There is dry structure, making it food friendly, but the wine is not for aging.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay

"This is a Zweigelt with an identity crisis that thinks it may be Pinot Noir. It's elegant and silky, with a gentle tannic touch, refreshing acidity and restrained but evocative redcurrant and cranberry fruit. Overtones of peony and iris make this more intriguing, while there is substance despite its light body. This is delicious now, but will reward cellaring for one to two years to let earthy, tertiary flavors develop. Drink from 2014.",Austria-Niederösterreich:Zweigelt

It stretches out on the finish.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Neutral for the most part, but this light-framed white slips in pear, orange and spice notes while maintaining a nice, juicy profile. Nothing more than a refreshing, lime-infused dandy. But what's wrong with that?",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Torrontés
"A wine that needs some aging. It is restrained at the moment, holding back its rich, very textured fruit flavors, along with acidity and a core of citrus. Keep for 2–3 years. Screwcap.",Austria-Niederösterreich:Grüner Veltliner
"Tight and tannic, this 99% Cabernet Sauvignon also has 1% Petit Verdot, which provides a faint floral note to the bouquet that is otherwise punctured by ripe swirls of cherry, vanilla and coconut, themes that repeat on the palate.

"This wine comes from a single vineyard in the western part of the appellation.

It's light and bright on the palate, with a steely focus of lime juice on peach.",US-California:Chardonnay

Flavors of brown sugar and caramel are more sweet and simple than complex.",Spain-Andalucia:Sherry
"Dark hibiscus and pomegranate notes meet with black plum, hearty clove, allspice and dried violets on the nose of this very heady wine.

"A nose led by aromas of fine oak, raspberry and mild spices opens this blend of 80% Carmenère and 20% Malbec. In the mouth, it's nicely built, with delicate layering and not too much weight. Toasty, spicy red-fruit flavors include a tobacco note and the wine tastes a bit chocolaty on the tail end. Drink through 2023.",Chile-Maule Valley:Red Blend
"This has a strong impression of sweetness, to the point of being almost cloying. That candied raspberry flavor is offset with citrusy acids, giving it a sweet/tart candy character. The flavors don't quite sync up.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"A confectionary note of marshmallow gives way to lighter intimations of citrus and sour-apple skin, making for a confusing combination of ripeness and tartness.",US-California:Chardonnay

"Can't-miss aromas of petrol, wet stones and lime will have you thinking this is Riesling, but the blend is two-thirds Garnacha Blanca and the rest Macabeo. Tight and well cut on the palate, this tastes of melon, lime and peach pit. A quick, lean finish works.",Spain-Catalonia:White Blend
"Trademark hints of flint and smoke often attributed to the Devonian-era slate of the middle Mosel abound in this sprightly off-dry Riesling. Its mineral backbone doesn't deflect, however, from buoyant white grapefruit and peach flavors that penetrate through the finish. Drink now through 2020.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"Succulence is one thing this Cab Franc possesses in abundance. It's enormously rich and concentrated in cherry pie and blackberry jam flavors, with a streak of cured meat. The tannins are quite brisk, so you might want to decant for a few hours.",US-California:Cabernet Franc

"This winery's Pinots rarely rise to the top, but are almost always soundly made, very good wines, with extra points for complexity.

It's the kind of Pinot that pairs well with foods without taking center stage.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Full, rich, quite heavy in style, this is only just brut, with its crushed strawberry flavor and low acidity. It works, as a fine wine for a red-fruit dessert, the balance remaining right up to the very soft aftertaste.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend

"Smoky notes of roasted meat and white pepper spice up the plum skins and blackberry fruit that show on the nose of this bottling. The smoke is also prominent on the sip, where graphite minerality frames the blueberry and blackberry fruit.

"This wine is a blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Malbec. It shows the big, hard tannins of both varieties, as well as their dryness and intense blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors.

Don't even think of popping the cork before 2015, and it should still be providing pleasure in 2021.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of toast, French oak, pressed yellow flower and white stone fruit lead the way. The rather lean palate offers yellow apple skin, bitter almond, saline and a honey note.",Italy-Tuscany:Vernaccia

"A rich, opulent wine at an unbelievable price, this Chard has layers of ripe peaches, pears and tropical fruits, and a lush overlay of toasty oak.

Juicy and thirst quenching yet deeply satisfying.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling

"Deutz's top cuvée is as good as ever. Bottle aging has helped it to throw off its youthful awakwardness and develop a rounded, ripe style that is now a pleasure to drink.

"This is a 100% Cabernet, and its tannins are so strong that it's virtually undrinkable now. It displays class in every way, with an intense concentration of cassis liqueur and blackberry that's especially deep in the middle palate, but it also persists into a long, spicy finish.

"This is made from fruit sourced from the oldest block of Syrah in Washington, which was planted in 1986.

The evident alcohol throws it off balance.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Cannonau
"Light and oaky at first, with earth notes. But then it goes awkward, showing imbalanced berry and plum fruit and overt oak. The wine shows some complexity and style, but at the same time it's all over the place, with hard tannins that subtract from the final tally.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon:Red Blend
"Mint, menthol, leather and wild berry aromas unfold in the glass, accompanied by a whiff of forest floor. The elegantly structured palate offers sour cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, white pepper and graphite alongside assertive but refined tannins and nervous acidity. Give this time to unwind and come together. Drink 2017–2030.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo

"A new release from the joint venture between Quinta de la Rosa and winemaker Jorge Moreira, this is a beautiful wood-aged wine, with delicious tropical fruits as well as a tense young structure.

"Toasty, buttery and spicy, this blend's aromas and flavors are heavily influenced by barrique. So if you are oak-averse, be warned.

"Clean and varietal, this firm and juicy Pinot Noir offers light, forward raspberry and plum fruit, dusted with cinnamon and cocoa. Medium concentration and length.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This full-bodied, richly tannic wine delivers. It starts off with savory notes of cracked pepper, black olives, violets and cedar, then eases into concentrated flavors of blueberries and roasted meat before ending with a flourish of firm, dusty tannins.

"From 130-year-old vines, this is a densely layered, bigtime Zin. The flavor concentration is just tremendous, a critical mass of briary, wild blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, licorice and fabulous Asian spice.

Based on Cabernet, with small quantities of Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, it has oak-influenced black and red currant, cassis, cherry, spicy plum pudding and sweet, smoky vanilla flavors, with a cedar, pencil-lead note reminiscent of a fine Pauillac. Lush now, it should develop well through 2015.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

"87-89 Barrel sample. Ripe fruit certainly, but over a structure which is much more mineral and dark. Maybe without the power of some of the year's wines, but it will show well in a more delicate style.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A blend of 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Shiraz, 14% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc and 1% Malbec, this clean, approachable red offers notes of black plum, cherry, cocoa and spice on the nose and mouth.

"Bright aromas of apricot, pear, lavender and jasmine capture the senses while the richly sweet stone fruit flavors also bring pleasure. The concentration and acid don't entirely match up but there's still much to enjoy.",US-Washington:Riesling
"Brambly berry flavors carry a streak of cola throughout this wine, 80% of which was whole-cluster fermented. The pleasant fruit is somewhat offset with chalky acids and drying tannins.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Tough and gritty, with edgy tannins framing rustic flavors of blackberries and sweetened berry tea.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Black and green olive tapenade and ripe plum come together around a soft, juicy yet ultimately tannic expression of the variety, given 14% Malbec and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon as worthy complements.",US-California:Merlot
This soft wine has a roasted fruit quality to it. Layers of jammy berry and plum show amidst a savory profile of tamed tannins and earth.,US-California:Petite Sirah
"This wine's ripe, mineral texture balances its yellow and white stone fruit flavors. It has a toasty, caramel character, giving extra richness. Drink from late 2017.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Beautifully perfumed, this has swathes of ripe cherry and plum, with a hint of wood aging. The balance is already well established, with a line of crisp acidity that sits behind the rich, sweet fruit. With its tannins, this needs to age for at least three years.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"A toasty touch of brioche joins ripe red and yellow-apple notes on the nose. The palate has even more of that autolytic richness, grounding both tart red apple and ripe lemon notes. Fine and creamy, the mousse highlights the fruit freshness while an earthier, toastier, richer background shimmers through enticingly. This harmonious and complex sparkler majors on beautiful development and pristine freshness. Lovely now, it is certain to develop further. Drink 2017–2025.",England-England:Sparkling Blend
"Released late, this may have benefitted somewhat with the extra bottle age, but it's still showing substantial tannins. Tart, barely ripe berry fruit quickly rolls into a short, chalky finish.",US-Oregon:Cabernet Franc
"Lush, aromatic and focused, this was barrel-fermented in 25% new French oak. It's balanced and built to age, with flavors of apples, roasted hazelnuts and a touch of buttered popcorn. It finishes with energizing minerality.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"Huge and extracted, with an opaque purple color and a massive, aggressive nose that hints at stewed fruit, sweaty leather, blackberry compote and shoe polish. Forget elegance and go straight for this wine's unbridled size and density. If that sounds unappealing, pass it by.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Syrah
"This satiny, slightly waxy Viognier is a blend from Ciel du Cheval, Red Willow and Olsen fruit; for the first time, roughly 10% was fermented in a concrete egg. Aromatic with yellow apples, lemon curd, bee pollen and floral highlights, it's underscored with a lick of wet stone.",US-Washington:Viognier
"Light garnet in color with a tawny rim, this offers earthy, wet stone aromas and then gushing fruit flavors like raspberry and wild blackberry that ride on a wave of lively acidity, making for a fascinating taste adventure. This nails the acid-tannin-alcohol balance in a way that's compelling and delicious.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Except for being just a bit linear, this is a really good Cabernet for the price. It offers rich blackberry, black currant liqueur, anise and cedar flavors that are wrapped into firm tannins. The balance is really impressive. It's throwing some sediment already, so decant it.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"On top of being made from organically grown grapes, this wine is vegan friendly. Of course, that means nothing unless the wine is good. Thankfully, this wine is excellent. Apricot, honey and ginger notes mingle easily on the palate. Drink this full-bodied, slightly open-knit wine over through 2017.",Australia-South Australia:Viognier
"A finely structured and shaped wine, the Sauvignon Blanc dominating the blend, but offering more of its tropical fruit side than its herbaceous character. However, there is a good hint of balanced wood, lifting and giving extra richness.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Cherry-berry crumble topped with vanilla cream gives this wine a brambly, succulent quality, dusted in light cinnamon spice, cedar and well-integrated tannin and oak. Powerful and full-bodied, it's fruity, balanced and enjoyable now.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Candied—almost confected—red fruit shimmers on the nose. On the palate, this turns into fleshy aromatic red cherry that carries immediate charm. The palate is light, refreshing and full of easy fruit. The finish is clean and reinforces that lovely cherry note.",Austria-Thermenregion:Pinot Noir
"Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this mountain-grown wine, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon but contains the other four classic Bordeaux varieties. Although it's very tannic, those tannins are remarkably soft. Nearly all-new oak provides a framework of smoky caramel, delicious enough, but just an accompaniment to the blackberries, black currants, cherries and dark chocolate. A fantastic wine for drinking now, and should last for many years in the cellar.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"89–91. Barrel sample. This is a delicious, spicy wine that glories in its peach and pear flavors. Opulent in style, the wine is ripe and rounded with just a twist of grapefruit acidity.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Hints of rye and caraway lend a spicy, savory tone to this herbaceous semi-sweet Riesling. Juicy and ripe with pleasant stone-fruit flavor, it finishes brisk and crisp.",Germany-Rheinhessen:Riesling
"Important and sophisticated, this has aged gracefully over the years. The style is bold and modern and you can feel the soft, oak-derived tannins and the complimentary fruit tannins that give this wine incredible structure and staying power. The bouquet is redolent of ripe fruit, leather, spice, black cherry and pressed violet.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Aromas of passion fruit, dried apricot, dill and candied nectarine zest lead the nose on this concentrated dessert wine. On the palate, bright acidity adds freshness to the candied lemon, pastry and yellow peach flavors.",Italy-Veneto:Garganega
"Produced from Malbec and fashionably pale, this wine is named after Julie Perrin, daughter of owner Alain-Dominique Perrin. It is light and deliciously crisp and refreshing. Bone dry, it is certainly a food rosé, although with its light raspberry flavor it will also be good as an apéritif. Julie Perrin, an artist, worked on the blend and created the château watercolor on the bottle.",France-Southwest France:Rosé
"Produced exclusively from Grand Cru vineyards in the Côte des Blancs, this is a beautiful, dry wine. It has a chalky texture and ample acidity that frames the tight fruit. The pure line of citrus and crisp green apples goes right to the heart of this balanced, bright wine that will age well. Drink now for the forward fruit, or wait for another two to three years.",France-Champagne:Chardonnay
"Fresh and broad aromas of strawberry syrup meet with eucalyptus oil and wild mint on the clean if simple nose of this bottling. It grows more tart on the sip, with roasted red plum, cranberry and pomegranate, but the fascinating parts are the curious hints of cannabis and hops, which give herbal depth to the fruit.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This warm expression of Nebbiolo opens with aromas of stewed prunes, resin and raisin. The palate offers plums steeped in spirits and espresso alongside green wood tannins that generate an abrupt finish.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"A ripe, soft wine that still does manage to preserve the Ayala lightness of touch. The fruit is green apple and pink grapefruit, with great freshness. The structure, though, is open and hints of yeast show through the fruit. The aftertaste is deliciously fresh.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Nearly always B-C's top wine or close to it, this quintessential hilltop vineyard combines power and finesse with sheer deliciousness of flavor. Silky and dry, the wine shows an earthy spiciness that undergirds ripe tastes of red cherries, pomegranates and cola. Best now and through 2012.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This wine delivers just about everything you'd possibly expect from the variety and the region—grassy aromas, a bountiful mix of herb and tropical fruit flavors, ample weight and texture, and a long finish built around a solid core of grapefruit.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"Firm with dark tannins, this is a structured wine. It is still reticent, likely to take several more years to show its fruit. It is dense with the black-plum fruit behind the firm tannins. With all this concentration, expect this wine to need at least until 2024 before drinking.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is an attractive fruity wine with citrus fruits and a tangy, zesty texture. The lightest hint of wood gives the wine extra richness. It is already drinkable.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"The color is dark and dense and so are the aromas, which show plenty of vanilla oak and mulberry fruit. As you might expect from winemaker Ben Glaetzer and the Mitolo family, this is a full-bodied Shiraz, albeit not quite as lush and riveting as the 2005 version. The tannins this year are soft, the acids a bit on the tart side, giving the fruit a crisp edge. Probable drinking window: 2010–2020.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
"Delicious and crisp in acidity, this is dry despite its flavors of honey and ripe, jammy tropical fruit. How this wine achieves such a quality is magic, but the brisk acidity helps, as does its stony minerality. Ready to enjoy now.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Orchard fruit, chopped herb and toasted bread crust aromas lead the nose. On the frothy palate, vibrant acidity frames strawberry and tangerine zest alongside a persistent perlage.",Italy-Lombardy:Sparkling Blend
"Jammy, reduced aromas of cassis, blueberry and animal hide lead to a juicy, fresh palate that's not too thick or concentrated. Blackberry and blueberry flavors are lightly peppered, while the finish is quick and light for Malbec. This is a new wine that aims at freshness and simple fruit more than power and weight.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"This is very nice varietal Bonarda. The nose is generic but floral, ripe and full of lifted blackberry and cassis aromas. A rubbery, agile palate carries dark, toasty flavors of blackberry, cassis and chocolate, then a peppery-tasting, toasty finish that manages to not be hot or fierce, which is a plus for this grape.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Bonarda
"Very lifted notes of camphor precede a light-bodied, refreshing white and remain within touching distance throughout. This is a fresh, if unusual, Riesling.",Austria-Niederösterreich:Riesling
"Dried herb, graphite and cedar form a cast of characters around a big powerful tannin concentration in this appellation wine. A bitter streak of tobacco plays games with sharper, crunchier aspects of cassis and clove.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"The Grandlieu lake, to the west of the Sèvre et Maine Muscadet vineyards, produces softer wines, like this. This wine is ripe, with hints of toast and vanilla as well as fresh and crisp apple acidity. It's a full-bodied, rounded wine that is just ready to drink and will be better from 2016.",France-Loire Valley:Melon
"This wine shows wet cement, lime rinds, light honeysuckle and fragrant minerality on the nose. The texture is solidly grippy and intriguing once sipped, with flavors of yellow grapefruit pith and Gala apples in the midpalate, sliding into a lime-rind tang on the finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"A little rugged around the edges, with jagged tannins that emphasize the acidity. But it's dry and balanced, and you'll find ripe flavors of cherries, pomegranates, red licorice and toast. Drink now.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Planeta's fresh rosé (made with Syrah) shows attractive berry, citrus, herb and sweet almond-paste notes.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Syrah
"The winery's flagship wine, Cabernet Sauvignon makes up just over half, with the balance Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Despite its age, it starts tight as a drum, with light aromas of spice, dark cherry, coffee and dried flowers. It's full flavored, with a dazzling richness to the textured fruit and barrel notes. Best after 2021.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of butterscotch, pear, peach, flowers and spice are followed by full-bodied stone-fruit flavors. It brings a fair amount of heat along with it but is certainly varietally correct.",US-Washington:Viognier
"Bright tangerine and wet stone notes kick off the palate in this light-bodied Chardonnay. As it opens, those notes develop into more defined lemon and tart green apple flavors. It's nice, vibrant and ready for salty food.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Black as a cave and thick as jam, this wine offers a decadence of black licorice and chocolate truffle, aged entirely in new French oak for 30 months. Fruit plays a supporting part to the richness, making for a wine that's a dessert in itself.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Slightly pale pink in color, this 50% Pinot Noir and 50% Chardonnay sparkling wine offers rosé-like aromas, dominated by watermelon water. The vibrant bubbles release bubblegum ester, lime and melon on the palate, making for an excellent brunch wine.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"This wine brims with almost overripe pear notes on the nose. The palate follows with equally full-fruited accents shot through with citric freshness, making for a super-juicy, super-easy, off-dry white. Drink soon to make most of the fruit.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"With Ribera wines there's an assumption of tannic presence, but this older vintage, while displaying a classy bouquet, is brutally tannic, with an acid-washed palate. Splashes of cranberry and plum flavors are cut by lemony acidity and drying sandpaper tannins.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"A blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier (to add some southern spice), this is a soft, fruity wine with rich white fruits and attractive acidity. It's a wine that can be drunk soon, although it should age several years.",France-Southwest France:White Blend
"This  blend of Cab, Sangiovese and Merlot has a fruity, almost sweet nose that recalls almond paste or Amaretto, with tones of blueberry and raspberry in the background. It's a fruitier, more immediate wine with pretty renderings of oak and toasted nut in the background. It's also clean and elegant with good staying power.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"This is one of the most beautiful Sauvignons made in Italy. The cool mountainous climate of the Dolomites has shaped a fragrant and elegant wine with tons of exotic fruit, white pepper, dried sage and tangerine. There's a touch of roundness in the mouth that gives it extra staying power.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon
"Mainly from Castelão with a little Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a ripe, full-bodied and complex wine. Tannins shoot through the solid black fruits, while acidity laces the texture. Flavors of chocolate, spice and final freshness promising short-term aging. Drink from 2015.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese Red
"Here's a nice, rich Pinot Noir for drinking now. It's fairly soft and sweet, showing raspberry and cherry cream, vanilla, toasty oak and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened with acidity.",US-California:Pinot Noir
