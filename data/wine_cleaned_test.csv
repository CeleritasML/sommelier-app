"A classic high-end Carmenère, with enticingly rich, chocolaty, herbal aromas. The palate is lush but balanced, with a generous texture, smooth tannins and plenty of depth. Saturated in flavor, with blackberry, herbal notes, chocolate, spiced meat and more. Drink now through 2012.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"Ripe, soft and full bodied, this wine has fresh citrus and gooseberry flavors along with zesty lemon and a bright aftertaste. It needs a few more months to fill out, so drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of wild red berry, sun-baked earth and dark cooking spices blossom in the glass. The medium-bodied, elegant palate delivers juicy wild cherry, crushed black raspberry, baking spice and grilled herb while smooth, polished tannins provide support.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"The initial impression is of a jammy, almost sweet wine. Later bright berry fruits, some wood and a dense tannin core kick in. With its sweet chocolate and juicy edge, this is a wine ready to drink now. Screwcap.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Vinified in stainless steel, this affordable wine doesn't need new oak flavors to flesh it out. It's sharply defined, with crisp apple and pear fruit that carries a touch of spice. The length and precision are impressive.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
Rubbery blackberry aromas are dense and horsey. This feel wide and chunky but loose at the seams. Oaky flavors of generic black fruits finish medicinal and a touch candied.,Chile-Central Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The Dardis designate is a mix of Wädenswil and Dijon 115 clones, aged for 10 months in 30% new French oak. Cherry, berry and chocolate flavors meld gracefully with a thread of cola. There's a briary undertone to the fruit, and a dusting of cocoa over the tannins. This is ready to enjoy immediately.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This standout wine has enticing herb and mineral aromas, plus rich, unorthodox flavors that resemble fresh fennel bulb and crisp white peach along with racy acidity and a good, substantial mouthfeel. It tastes concentrated, though not overly full bodied, but most of all it has a memorable personality.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"The blended white from Beaucastel is every bit as enjoyable right now as the more expensive Vieilles Vignes bottling, offering more generous notes of honeyed oranges, a rich, weighty mouthfeel and a long, harmonious finish. Drink now.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style White Blend
"This light-bodied, dry wine smells fresh and fruity, tastes like crisp apples and honeydew melon, and has a soft texture that makes it easy to sip.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"Intensely mineral on the nose, followed up on the palate by flavors of crushed vitamin tablets, wet stone and brine. Despite some residual sweetness, the overall impression is of salty, mineral dryness coupled with tart, citrusy flavors on the finish.",Germany-Nahe-Riesling
"Worldwide still the biggest-selling Champagne (28 million bottles a year), this well-made wine is ripe and full of fruit. Produced under the direction of chef de cave Benoît Gouez (Wine Enthusiast Winemaker of Year in 2013), it has flavors of almonds and toast, with crisp acidity. The aftertaste brings grapefruit freshness.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This well-balanced, off-dry wine has a fine line of acidity to balance its gentle sweetness. It features flavors of vanilla and baked apples. The wine could be matched with fruit desserts, but it is best consumed on its own.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"An ambitious wine that aims for the fences and hits a double. It's soft and super-fruity, with the sweet, extracted flavors of blackberries and cherries, liberally enhanced with oak, that characterize modern Napa cult-style Cabs. But it lacks some depth and complexity, especially at this inflated price.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Pure Merlot from a cool site in a cool vintage yields a somewhat attenuated wine with tart berry fruit. The barrel aging has contributed flavors of sandalwood and chocolate, but the chalky tannins need some rich red meat to soften them up.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Both a study of clone and stainless-steel processing, this wine offers fresh-cut pineapple, ripe Gala apple, honeydew and even peach, with a citrus-skin sharpness to the nose. The flavors are delicate and familiar but complex and deep, with Anjou pears, lemon-lime soda and apple flesh. It's a lively stainless expression.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This wine's light and refreshing nose cuts between orange-blossom ripeness, lime-juice sharpness, chalky minerality and a touch of milk fat. There is good energy on the palate, powered by tart green apple rinds and citrus zest.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Lusciously ripe, almost honeyed, pear fruit emanates from the glass. Underneath that is grapefruit zest and pith and a herbal, stony, earthy edge. The palate is rich and curvaceous but completely toned by a pervasive, lemony acidity that lends drive and linearity. This is already approachable, which is not to say that it doesn't promise a lot of mileage: this will go on and unfold its facets of fruit. Immense charm almost plays over the fact that this is a very age-worthy wine, with a finish that's almost endless. Drink from 2017.",Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
"Cupinero is a softly oaked red that's immediately likeable. It makes an elegant first impression with sweet cherry, white peppercorn, chocolate and exotic spice. Wood tones are more evident in the mouth, where vanilla and toasted flavors take over. Drink after 2010.",Italy-Tuscany-Merlot
"Air-dried Falanghina grapes are pressed to produce a golden-colored dessert wine with aromas of dried hay, honey, almond, apricot and even a touch of fresh celery that lends a zesty, green accent. The finish is dominated by rich flavors of dried apple.",Italy-Southern Italy-Falanghina
"While the tannins are still young, enough fruit gives balance and potential to the wine. It has structure and a dry texture sustained by the black currant fruitiness in the background. Drink from 2017. Joseph Arbo bought the property in 1988 and installed a new winery in 2011.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This well-balanced, deliciously ripe wine is full of black fruit, dark tannins and crisply textured acidity. A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec, it's juicy and rich while also poised and stylish. The wood aging shows slightly at the end, along with dry tannins, so it needs to age further. Drink from 2020.",France-Southwest France-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"With a high percentage of Malvasia in the blend, the wine has an attractive floral character that softens and fills out the mineral texture. It is crisp while ripe, finishing with vibrant acidity. Drink now.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"Informal and bright, this cheerful Prosecco offers subtle aromas of white flower and citrus with broader background notes of pear and dried hay. The bubbly wine shows easy, but sharp and refreshing perlage.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"The bright gold color and botrytis aromas tell you right off the bat that this is late-harvest juice. In the mouth, the extract and thickness are that of Vendanges Tardives Alsace whites, and flavor-wise, there's quince, peach and cinnamon, along with more botrytis and white raisins. Quite interesting for the region and a solid take on European-style late-harvest Gewurz. Possibly best with blue cheese or foie gras.",US-Oregon-Gewürztraminer
"Light aromas of lime, apple peel and honeysuckle show on the nose of this bottling. The style leans toward the racy end of the spectrum, with lime-zest energy, chalky tension and a touch of red apple fruit.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Tough in tannins and dustily dry, this is a hard wine to warm up to. It's not just the astringency but the absence of fruit. Shows modest flavors of cherries and blackberries, and doesn't seem like an ager. A disappointment.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Boasts tremendously ripe fruit—the stated alcohol level is 15.5%—yet doesn't seem overly hot or bulky. As you might expect, the tannins are soft, while the flavors of cassis pick up hints of cola, earth and tobacco. Despite the ripeness, there's a streak of tangy acidity that holds everything together. Drink now.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe blackberry and cola aromas comes across as foresty and nice as a whole. This saturated, dense Malbec shows brutish, choppy tannins along with flavors of blackberry, exotic spices and fig. The finish remains rough and turns hot. Drink through 2021.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
This Pinot Meunier-dominated wine makes great use of the grape's natural fruitiness and softness. It is ripe with swathes of acidity that have been tempered by the three years of reserve wines in this nonvintage blend. It is ready to drink.,France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Fresh green apple and herb notes flit and dance throughout the nose and palate of this delicate off-dry Riesling. It's rich with sweet peach and nectarine flavor, but also layered and complex with notes of minerals, blossoms and vibrant lime acidity.",US-New York-Riesling
"This blend of Mourvèdre, Carignane and Syrah is still quite young but already shows lots of savory potential. Wild berry, underbrush, subtle game and crushed slate aromas lead into a palate of loaded with mulberry, sagebrush and cedar flavors. It has loads of energy out of the gate.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This fine vintage of Insignia combines 87% Cabernet Sauvignon with 9% Petit Verdot, 2% Malbec and 2% Cabernet Franc. Soft, supple and seamless, it offers rich but balanced cassis and milk chocolate flavors, with supportive and complementary oak. It should do well in the cellar and will be best from 2024–2034.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Jumpy raspberry and candied plum aromas are akin to Kool-Aid. A rubbery, grabby palate and foxy, medicinal flavors of latex and berry fruits culminate on a strained finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"A disappointing blend of wine sourced from Mornington and Yarra, this is a bit pale in color, with a Sherried edge to the fruit and some astrigency on the finish.",Australia-Victoria-Pinot Noir
"Subdued aromas of ripe dark berry, violet, spice and a whiff of Alpine herb come together on this. The lively, straightforward palate offers up black raspberry, blackberry and nutmeg alongside velvety tannins. Drink soon.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Lagrein
"This wine does not display the Riesling sweetness scale that's found on most Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Rieslings. This is off dry, and it has punchy peach, pear and apple flavors.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Leathery berry aromas are wiry and come with a hit of lemony oak. The palate is tightly focused by staunch acids, while flavors of tart berry, red plum, oak spice and pepper end with scouring bite and a note of anise. This is 85% Tempranillo with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"This tight wine has intense acidity, smoky tannins, a light texture and an attractive strawberry-jelly-flavored finish.",France-Alsace-Pinot Noir
"This is an aromatic, honeysuckle-tinged cool-climate white, with layers of honey and spice. Light in body and texture, this complex, Alsace-style effort is the perfect accompaniment to Thai, Indian, Korean barbecue or spicy Chinese food.",US-California-Gewürztraminer
"Aromatically unctuous and inviting, this rich, thick Petit Verdot, one of Concannon's smaller bottlings, is mouthfilling in chocolate, tobacco and dark plum, long-lasting through the midpalate and finish. Soft, with moderate tannins, it's a big wine with structure that'll age or pair with serious meat or game now.",US-California-Petit Verdot
"Delicately fragrant, this opens with scents of chopped herb, elderflower, hay and citrus. On the crisp palate, a hint of vanilla underscores peach and grapefruit while a light mineral note backs up the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Cabernet Sauvignon
This subtle but refreshing wine strikes a wonderful balance between fresh pear notes and citrus zestiness and texture. It's spicy and versatile.,Austria-Weinviertel-Grüner Veltliner
"Jacaman's basic county-wide Pinot isn't as good as their Anderson Valley or Russian River bottlings, but it's not as expensive. Shows a good grasp of Pinot essentials, with a silky texture framing cherry, cola and spice flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is the winery's first release of this vineyard-designated wine. Cocoa, fresh herb, tire rubber and cherry aromas are followed by cassis flavors backed by tightly wound tannins.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A straightforward wine, this has aromas of light spices and stone fruit. The flavors are lighter in style with the concentration a bit wanting but it still provides easy drinking pleasure.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Gritty aromas of asphalt, green peppercorn, saucy berry and hard spices precede a tight palate with grating tannins. This is oak-heavy, with sweet-and-saucy red-berry flavors. An oaky, tomatoey finish is rubbery in feel.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This shows ripe fruit aromas of cherry and blackberry backed by leather, smoke and teriyaki notes. Thick and smooth, it has a velvety, fruit-driven finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Smooth and already a seamless, complex and compelling whole, this estate-grown reserve overdelivers for the price. Roughly one-fifth new oak balances the modest alcohol, and the just-ripe berry and pomegranate fruit. Light hints of earth, coffee grounds and sassafras add further detail through a lingering finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This is a bright fruit-driven wine, with clean and refreshing flavors. All stainless fermented, it's got a sharp, tangy finish, that will cut through rich creamy sauces.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Mildly sharp and herbal smelling, with olive, plum and leather aromas. Healthy in the mouth, maybe a touch needle-like, but overall the wine's dry red fruit, pepper and herbal accents seem right for the category it's playing in. Good for under $10.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Merlot
"Tight and tannic, with an herbal edge, this stiff and rather unyielding wine remains a bit puzzling. Hints of cranberry, mulberry and blueberry are somewhat overtaken by herbal, earthy notes.",US-Oregon-Malbec
"With a smidgen of Petit Verdot, this dark, tight and leathery wine is exalted in tobacco, graphite and tar, still youthfully awkward and shy. The flavors lean savory into meaty aspects of currant and clove, waiting to find companionship in fruit. Drink now after a decant, or cellar through 2023.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"With aromas of honey, papaya and white flowers, this dry Moscatel from Málaga announces its ripe character. In the mouth, this is weighty and creamy more than racy and direct. Flavors of sweet melon and bitter peach pit come with anise and nutmeg, while the finish is long and offers a candied orange flavor.",Spain-Andalucia-Moscatel
"This is all about buttered toast, buttered popcorn and orange- and pineapple-soda flavors. Fans of the popular style will love it.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This was a difficult vintage in Washington, and the style of this dry Riesling seems to have changed significantly, perhaps as a result. The grapefruit flavors have no body or texture; it's light, certainly refreshing, but rather simple.",US-Washington-Riesling
"The purest scent of fresh, ripe red cherries is the first pleasure to be encountered on this elegant wine. On the slender palate this lovely fruit expression is joined by earthier tones of undergrowth and peat. There is a central seam of freshness that pulls fruit, silky tannin and soft texture together. If there was just one attribute I could name it would be elegance. Lovely and fresh now but Rosenberg ages most gracefully. Drink 2016–2024.",Austria-Burgenland-St. Laurent
"Aromas of pressed rose, red berry, chopped herb and espresso lead the nose. The firm palate offers juicy black cherry, licorice and a hint of mocha alongside a backbone of fine-grained tannins. Drink after 2018.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"While oak can commonly overwhelm Chardonnay, this is a perfect example of an appropriate balance. Toasted notes of almond and peach pit intertwine with red apple and underripe pear; crisp acidity shines through on the finish.",Israel-Galilee-Chardonnay
"Light dried orange peel, herb and candlewax aromas lead to broad, medium-bodied fruit flavors in this white. It's enjoyable despite the muted aromatic expression.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This is big and bacony on the nose, with herbal berry aromas and notes of spice and more. It feels lifted and nervy, with vital, almost volatile acidity and resiny, oak-led flavors of vanilla and black fruit. This is minty, spicy and aggressive on the finish.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this wine brings aromas of iron and huckleberry pie. The blueberry and earth flavors are quite ripe, lingering on the finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"A $20 Châteauneuf-du-Pape? Yup, and it's pretty darn good, too. Thyme and clove notes accent the black cherry fruit, and meaty, savory flavors emerge on the palate. It's  appropriately full bodied and perhaps a bit rustic, but satisfying. Drink now and over the next few years.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Just bright fruit, this is a ripe soft wine. The 50% Malvasia Fina in the blend gives it a perfumed, aromatic character while also adding a lemon zest tang. Drink now.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"This lovely Gewürztraminer is floral without being cloying, and carries the varietal marker often described as talcum powder. There's a hint of mint, and despite the 16 g/L residual sugar, it's crisp and fresh.",US-Washington-Gewürztraminer
"This has the look of a monster. It's dense and dark in color, with brooding aromas of plum and mushroom. Yet that's somewhat deceptive, because it's relatively light and nimble on the palate. It's a fine juxtaposition of darkness and levity that should drink well through 2020.",New Zealand-Martinborough-Pinot Noir
"This rich blend gets its ripe texture and warm pear and citrus flavors from 50% Sémillon. It has an attractive perfumed edge, with kiwi-like acidity and a peppery aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",France-Southwest France-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Beautifully pale pink in color with delicate shadings of peach and copper, this is an extremely elegant rosé sparkler from the Franciacorta area of northern Italy. The aromas are simple and straightforward, focusing on rose petal, cranberry and peach. The mouthfeel is crisp and easy.",Italy-Lombardy-Sparkling Blend
"Swathes of ripe fruit dominate this full wine that verges on being too alcoholic. While the acidity gives it freshness and the perfumed Cabernet Franc in the blend lends lift, the wine seems weighed down by its own richness.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The wine starts off slowly due to a note of almond nut or cardboard that masks the natural fruit. Once it gets started, however, this luminous sparkling Prosecco offers cheerful notes of stone fruit and pear.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"Not as dark and sticky as many wines of this variety; the nose is defined by cherry and raspberry along with barnyard and animal hide. At first the palate seems sharp and acidic, but with time it settles on fuller, more creamy cherry and raspberry along with mocha. Narrow on the finish but fresh and forward.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Carmenère
"Piercing on the nose, with hickory smoke, char and exotic boysenberry aromas. Feels high in acid and low in density, with a tight and biting mouthfeel along with heavily oaked flavors of berry fruit, vanilla, butter and coconut. Very fresh and colorful, but lacking in stuffing and complexity.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Heady, gamy and thick notes of lanolin, blood, lamb, smoked wood, roasted fennel, pencil lead and peppercorn rise into intriguing coriander and cumin notes on the nose of this blend of 52% Grenache, 26% Syrah and 22% Mourvèdre. Those exotic spice notes carry to the palate, where a medium acidity and clean tannic structure present black peppercorn and cardamom notes atop a boysenberry backdrop.",US-California-G-S-M
"Brunello Poggiotondo opens with a rich, dark appearance and bright aromas of cherry, root beer, humus and chopped mint. It's bright and clean wine in the mouth that ends with a blast of red berry fruit.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Ripe and soft on the nose, this blend of Monastrell, Garnacha and Syrah is so easygoing that it lacks pop up front. Plump and fruity on the palate, this is low on structure and acidity. Jammy raspberry and strawberry flavors end in friendly fashion, but with low definition. Drink now.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"This wine starts with typical Pinot Gris aromas of apple, pear and ginger, then picks up some citrusy flavors on the palate before ending on a note of orange zest. It's medium in weight, with a dry, silky feel as it glides across the palate.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Gris
"One of better deals for Pinot Noir anywhere, this bottling by Alison Crowe shows cinnamon, star anise, ripe red cherry, turned earth and wet slate on the easy-to-like nose. The palate packs more cherries with ripe strawberries, tart plum skins, orange-juice tang and a lingering clove-spice character.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Light aromas of toast, apple, vanilla and custard are followed by lightly creamy fruit and barrel flavors that provide interest.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"This is dry, acidic and a little underripe, with a New Zealand-like touch of gooseberry. A respectable wine, this has a bright core of lemon, lime and tropical fruit.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"A solid wine, rich in oak-inspired orange, apricot and Asian pear flavors, with a spicy, creamy finish. The acidity is notable, making this Chardonnay brisk and clean.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This light, fruity wine does have tannins that give dryness along with mature berry fruit. Dried fruitcake flavors dominate and the wine will not age further. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Ripe, raisiny aromas of earthy berry fruits, chocolate and vanilla introduce a choppy palate with oaky flavors of dried cheese and cream. This also shows dried plum and berry flavors on a full, scratchy palate. End notes of foresty berry fruits, earth, licorice and hard spices are impressively solid. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain-Mencía
"Brooding aromas of coffee, vanilla and herbs lead to elegantly styled fruit flavors that taper toward the finish.",US-Washington-Merlot
"This opens with aromas of black berries, toasted oak and spice. On the palate, notes of espresso, roasted coffee bean and vanilla back up ripe black cherry but drying wood tannins give it an abrupt finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Aromas of green olive, tapenade, mineral, peat, flowers and earthy funk lead to plum and savory flavors. It's lighter styled and all about elegance of expression, with guava flavors on the finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Cocoa, coffee, spice and dark fruit aromas are followed by smooth fruit flavors. The barrel influence is primary but this still brings plenty of enjoyment, with good balance and depth of flavor.",US-Washington-Malbec
"This is a beatifully balanced, not-too-full-bodied wine from vines grown at 2,400 feet in the Sierra range. It has classic black cherry, black olive and anise aromas, harmonious fruit flavors accented with light oak spiciness and a firm, fine-grained tannic structure.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"That this wine is all Merlot is the reason both for its jammy richness and its high alcohol. It gives a wine that is out of balance, with pepper, spice and wood dominating the super-ripe black cherry fruits. It's unlikely to age for long.",France-Bordeaux-Merlot
"A fine balance between the nuttiness of aged tawny and ripe sweet fruit makes an attractive, mellow yet tangy wine. The sweetness is given liveliness by the final acidity.",Portugal-Port-Port
Slight spritz accentuates the light-footed freshness of this subtly citric wine. There are notions of ocean spray and the softest lemon scent. There are hints of peach and plum at the very slender core.,Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
"A really nice Sauvignon Blanc, so easy to drink for its dryness, tart crispness and minerality. It feels clean and palate-stimulating, and offers enough citrus, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors to satisfy.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon are equally represented in this soft, robust blend that also includes smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Juicy blackberry and plum combine with dusty, integrated tannin, as a length of dark cherry and sage weave in and out.",US-California-Red Blend
"This new project of Elias Fernandez and Doug Shafer, of Shafer Vineyards, continues to impress with this standout white, sourced from Carneros, where the duo planted four acres of the variety a few years back. It's achingly pretty and substantive—exotic, complex and lingering, with sizzling acidity. Peach and honeysuckle stand out, while the texture is so sublime, you'll simply want more.",US-California-Albariño
"Fruit from this Willamette Valley sub-AVA usually shows an herbal side, and here it is nicely melded into a fruit mix of melon, berry and pear. It sounds oddly like a white wine, but it's not; and the color and scents are clearly varietal. Penetrating and sharp, with excellent definition.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Powdery, perfumed aromas of raspberry and red plum announce a palate with ringing acidity. Plum, red currant and strawberry flavors come with moderate loamy weight, while the finish takes on an earthy quality that's balanced by shearing, tangy acidity. This is only 60% Tempranillo while the rest is Garnacha, Graciano and Mazuelo. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"At seven years of age, this is a reasonably complex wine, well suited to pair with roasts. The ample oak is integrated with the fruit, yielding a mélange of nuances that include grilled meat, cedar, vanilla, dried spices, coffee, black olives, blackberries and tar. Drink now–2015.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Bold tannins and firm acidity make this wine a bit stiff to enjoy now, but it should benefit from aging through 2020. Aromas are lightly earthy, while flavors reflect cranberry and tart cherry. The texture carries a tooth-coating layer of tannins.",US-California-Syrah
"This is a simple, light take on Syrah, with a little bit of black pepper, a hint of underbrush, but none of the texture and detail of pricier Washington bottles. It's a light, pleasant red, fine for pizza night.",US-Washington-Syrah
"A bit reduced when first opened, it throws off scents of burnt rubber, then slowly opens into a roundly fruity, lightly toasty Pinot with a firmly tannic base. Flavors of Dr. Pepper drift through the midpalate. Give it a good decanting and it's fine for near-term consumption.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This opens with an intense fragrance of perfumed berries, crushed blue flower, hints of Mediterranean herbs and a whiff of new leather. The ripe palate brings together juicy wild cherry layered with notes of baking spices alongside supple tannins and just enough freshness. Enjoy now–2017.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Here's a beautifully crisp and golden Passito dessert wine that seems to shine bright with Italian sunlight intensity. The velvety wine is redolent of dried apricot, peach cobbler and almond honey.",Italy-Veneto-White Blend
"Simple and Porty, with baked berry flavors that finish sharp and astringent.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Strong in flavor and smooth in the mouth, this soft, juicy Syrah is like velvet made of blackberries, blueberries and chocolate. It is, in a word, delicious, and while it's somewhat sweet, the acidity and minerality balance it.",US-California-Syrah
"Untamed, foxy aromas of wild berry, bramble bush and olive come in front of a palate with nails for tannins. This tastes highly herbal or mildly green, depending on how you look at it. A raw, hot finish renders this low on charm.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Here's a structured red from southern Italy with aromas of red and black berries, forest floor and vanilla. The palate delivers ripe raspberry and black cherry along with white pepper, clove and notes of well integrated oak.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"This almost colorless wine has a slight aroma of bananas and roses, and a very light flavor of cucumbers. It's light-bodied, soft in texture and short on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"Earthy leather, forest floor, herb and balsamic aromas emerge in the glass. The taut, wiry palate offers sour cherry, dried sage and clove flaavors, set against a backdrop of bracing tannins that leave a firm finish. Give it a few more years to soften, then drink to capture the remaining fruit.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Crushed minerals and steel reverberate amidst concentrated lime and lemon in this racy, laser-edged Riesling. Dry and taut on the palate, it finishes long with spine tingling acidity and revitalizing tangs of mineral intensity.",Germany-Rheinhessen-Riesling
"The fruit for this Columbia Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is sourced from a dozen different vineyards, blended into a firm, purely varietal example of Washington Cabernet Sauvignon. The rich aromatics of black fruits, baking spices, dust, and cocoa powder roll into a full-flavored midpalate, enhanced with a light floral component.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Hints of cut grass and passion fruit on the nose are followed by attractive tropical fruit and fresh herbs on the palate. This medium-bodied wine boasts a soft, rounded feel that turns slightly chalky on the finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Lambrusco is a fizzy red wine from central Italy that has the natural acidity to cut through cheese tortellini and buttery pasta dishes. This enjoyable Amabile (or slightly sweet) expression is redolent of red berries, wet earth and red beet.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"Chunky, chewy and full-bodied, this fills the glass with flavors of tart red berries, tea leaves, wintergreen and a whiff of smoke. It's a gulp-able, interesting, and relatively affordable example of the outstanding 2012 vintage in Oregon.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Sometimes you need a solid wine to pair with spaghetti and meat sauce or simple meat dishes like pork or breaded veal. This Sicilian Nero d'Avola fits the bill and offers a bright bouquet of berry, almond and cola.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"This simple red leads with baking spice, underbrush and red-skinned berry aromas. The palate delivers orange peel, black cherry and clove flavors, with round tannins. Drink soon.",Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto
"Very dark, very focused, and very pure, this full-bodied wine polishes the notorious tannins of the varietal just slightly, while pouring on dark chocolate, blackberry jam, white pepper and a touch of floral flavor. It's a great wine to buy and stash in a cool place for a few years to see how interesting Petite Sirah can get. Best after 2024.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Aromas of blueberry, baking spice and a whiff of leather lead the nose of this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot. The firm palate offers black plum, raspberry and black pepper alongside smooth tannins. It finishes on a note of mouth-puckering sour cherry.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"A rare Petit Verdot from Washington, very dark and smoky, with earth, herb, a smooth palate, and ripe tannins. This is more terroir-driven than varietally “correct” – a bit of green tea flavor comes in with the tannins, but overall everything is nicely managed.",US-Washington-Petit Verdot
"Candied berry and cotton candy aromas include creamy notes of oak and vanilla. A beefy, muscular palate gives dark flavors of blackberry and chocolate, while peppery spice and burnt notes rise up on a spunky finish.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Malbec
"Flowery and fresh, this is a classic cool-climate white. Fragrant acidity is balanced by the citrus and pear flavors. Fruity and crisp, it is ready to drink.",France-Southwest France-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine, from selections of Touriga Nacional, is dense and firm. It has a dark structure that is only slowly developing to bring out the rich black-currant fruits. It is a ripe wine with a strong, mineral texture to balance the final acidity. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Alentejano-Touriga Nacional
"Pretty aromas convey rose, wild red berry, savory herb and a hint of baking spice. The palate opens with wild cherry, black raspberry, clove and sage but drops off quickly on the midpalate. It's already accessible, with fine-grained tannins and bright acidity.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"91-93 Fresh, citrus and spicy pear flavors, a wine laced with acidity, a crisp texture and elegant bright aftertaste.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"The ultimate in spice and sweetness, this unctuous, full-bodied wine has developed a beautifully, smooth, honeyed texture that envelops and balms the palate. Yellow fruits are delicate in background, along with a touch of acidity. It's a wine to drink now.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Simple and jammy, with sharp flavors of raspberries, cherries, gingersnap cookies and spices. Tasty and sweet, but lacking the structure to contain all that richness.",US-California-Merlot
"Full-bodied and ripe, this is a rich, generous wine that shows complexity as well as subtle fruitiness. A blend of Viosinho and Verdelho, it's full of tropical fruit flavors, with ample weight and concentration. Spicy accents, a dense texture and a fine, long-lasting finish are all part of this stylish wine.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
The nose is very shy: a mere hint of earthiness emanates. The slender palate shows very clean fruit of yellow apple residing on a slender lemony palate. This is fresh and sprightly with a dry finish. Drink soon.,France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"This wine stops you in your tracks with its aromas of earth, peat, fire pit, tapenade and coffee. The flavors are outrageously rich, dense and textured, with a lightly tacky feel to the tannins and a hyperextended finish. It's a knockout.",US-Washington-Tempranillo
"You won't find many $7 wines better than this Garnacha. The bouquet of fresh berries is like a bowl of black fruit. The palate is lively and a touch creamy, with medicinal, candied flavors of plum and cherry. This wine, like most Borsao reds, delivers above its price point.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"Scratchy, dusty red-berry aromas are decidedly sweet yet hollow. This semisweet Garnacha tastes of gummy red fruits. A flat, cloying finish with candied flavors confirms its sweet status.",Spain-Central Spain-Garnacha
"Whole-cluster pressed and barrel fermented, this is a deep gold, and opens powerfully with scents of buttered fruit and nuts. It's rich and creamy, showing toast and other barrel tones ahead of any specific fruit. Drink now through 2018.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"This rich but tannic wine shows ripe fruitiness as well as dense structure. There is a good balance between juiciness and dryness in this wine, which is already developing well.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Amply displays the charms and shortocmings of the 2008 vintage: complex if slightly herbal cherry fruit, medium body and great freshness. Drink now–2013.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This single-vineyard 100% Cabernet Franc is firm, juicy and focused. It has a phenolic bite at the back end, along with lemony acids. The concentration of fruit and herb flavors is excellent, which makes it a fine steak wine and also a bottle to stow away for a few more years.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"Plum and raspberry aromas are clean, fruity and simple. The palate follows suit with lively acidity and punchy tannins in support of plum, cherry and moderate spice flavors. A light, zesty finish preserves this Monastrell's easy drinkability.",Spain-Levante-Monastrell
"Deliciously ripe in raspberries, cherries and plums, with an exotic coating of sweetly caramelized oak. The texture is fine and silky, but ultimately the wine is too sweet and simple.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Generally this is a nice South American Chardonnay. The nose offers touches of apple, pear, peach and light oak, while the palate has bounce, acidity and tangy apricot, nectarine and apple flavors. Finishes lively but dilute, with citrus and lemon peel flavors. Hits the target.",Argentina-Other-Chardonnay
"Fruity and forward, this is a pretty, approachable wine with bright berry and cherry fruit. There's a strong note of citrus, particularly orange flesh and rind, and it's the sort of no-nonsense, gluggable wine that one rarely finds associated with Pinot Noir. This will be best enjoyed by 2018.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Rich texture combines with subtle flavors in this full-bodied, complex wine. It opens with mineral and white pepper aromas, broadens into Anjou pear, vanilla and toasted almonds flavors, and finishes with creamy concentration.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Rich and structured, this shows the plushness of today's Bordeaux Merlot. Ripe berry fruits, dark plums and a touch of vanilla give spice and round off the texture. It's juicy, still developing and best from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Merlot
"A blend of Duras and Braucol, grapes local to Gaillac, this wine is named after the spirit (Ame) of wine. Showing the potential of red Gaillac, this is a beautifully balanced and concentrated wine, with tannins that are already well integrated into the wood and sweet fruits. Age for 4–6 years, but can be drunk sooner.",France-Southwest France-Red Blend
"A taut but expressive nose of minerals, pepper and red fruit lead this lovely wine from Stellensbosch. The velvety, mouthfilling flavors of slightly sweet berry and spice are luxuriant, and the finish is long. Soft and refined but memorable. A beautiful wine with ageable appeal.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The celebrated Barbaresco Asili shows deep concentration and ripe fruit, with a bright cherry note and a perfumed blue-flower touch. Notes of sweet basil and chopped herb follow, giving the bouquet an aromatic lift.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Underbrush, ripe plum and baking spice aromas waft out of the glass. On the palate, vanilla, licorice, dark chocolate and espresso accent the black cherry core while polished tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2017.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This blend of 64% Syrah and 36% Cabernet Sauvignon is starting to show its age, with light prune, dried cherry-tobacco and clove aromas. Dried strawberry, star anise and baking spice arise on the palate, which is full of flavor but should be enjoyed soon.",US-California-Red Blend
"Sweet berry aromas blend with dark chocolate and leather on the nose. The palate is proper feeling and well balanced, with oak-driven chocolaty flavors supporting berry fruit. Finishes with a dry, spicy aftertaste.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Jumpy aromas suggest wet animal fur. In the mouth, there's not a lot of structure or body; flavors of buttery oak and candied berry lack continuity.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"Smells funky, with sweaty leather aromas, although you'll also find varietal notes of the grape. Tastes all right, with blackberries, currants, leather and mocha that are wrapped into firm tannins.",US-California-Syrah
"There may be an interesting wine lurking in the dark shadows here, but the oak and alcohol are overpowering in ways that mask the plummy cinnamon within.",US-California-Sangiovese
"A youthful wine that is just packed with fruit. It is a blend of Trincadeira, Aragonez and Syrah. Juicy, ripe and rich with black plum flavors, it is a delicious wine already. Drink now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Always estate grown and 100% varietal, Beresan makes one of the best Sémillons in the state. Exceptionally dry and crisp, this again suggests sweet grain, citrus and light tropical fruits. Notes of lemon oil and even a hint of diesel come in as subtleties. Though not as full-bodied and rich as the 2006, it's an excellent, well-made bottle, more in the style of a Bordeaux blanc.",US-Washington-Sémillon
"Medium bodied and firm textured, this has smoke and white pepper aromas, rich tomato and plum flavors, and light herbal accents. It offers moderate tannins and a smooth mouthfeel, with a bit of tannic bite.",US-California-Sangiovese

"Grenache takes the lead, making up 60% of this wine, which was co-fermented with Cabernet. Generous aromas of earth, white pepper, herbs, flowers, funk, smoked salt and crushed strawberry lead to a palate chock-full of smoked meat and savory flavors. It shows a beautiful sense of elegance and grace that belies the richness and length of the fruit and savory flavors.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Textured wine, the crisp white fruits are tight against acidity and spice. It fills the mouth, broadening into a wine that becomes creamy, with wood and green plum skins giving structure. This is another example of how a lesser appellation can shine at the hands of a master vigneron.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This wine is a blend of Grenache (44%), Counoise (36%), Syrah (10%) and Cinsault. Quite pale in color, it offers appealing aromas of raspberries and cranberries along with smoke. The flavors are light and lithe, putting a premium on purity, trailing slightly toward the finish.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Black cherry, dark-fleshed plums and black pepper hints are mellowed by the rich overtones of new oak, while a seam of acidity keeps everything trim and fresh. This medium-bodied wine is approachable with a tangy black olive edge and medium length.",Austria-Burgenland-St. Laurent
"Plum, raisin and red licorice aromas are ripe and heady. This feels tight and structured, with meaty tannins. Black cherry and oaky chocolate flavors end mild and chunky, with length. This should raise no complaints.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A pleasure to taste a Cabernet this rich in fruit, yet one that finishes so dry. It's delicious in blackberries, currants and mocha, wrapped into sweetly smooth tannins. It's a little high in alcohol and soft in acidity. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Produced by the Château de Bligny close to Beaune, this soft, perfumed wine has stalky red fruits, laced with a dry core of tannin and fragrant acidity. It could age for another year.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"A very sweet red blend, this has easy-to-like raspberry and vanilla flavors. Give it a slight chill and drink it with ham sandwiches.",US-California-Red Blend
"Visitors to Sonoma Valley are familiar with the beautiful Cherryblock Vineyard, which has been Sebastiani's flagship Cabernet source for decades. The 2010 vintage was kind to it, producing fruit that's not only exceptionally ripe, but well structured. Balanced acidity and soft, intricate tannins house luscious black cherry, currant, anise and new oak flavors. The wine should age in the bottle for at least eight years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Done in a fresh and leesy style, this offers minimalistic fruit flavors, but strong suggestions of phenolics such as apple skins, grapefruit pith and lemon peel. The underlying mineral-drenched acidity keeps it lively.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"This opens with unusual aromas of moist soil, hay, truffle, underbrush, baked bean, molasses and black-skinned fruit. The palate offers prune, espresso, dried black cherry, thyme and anisette alongside bracing tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Lots of zippy acidity in this bone-dry Pinot Noir, a testament to the chilly vintage. If you can get past the tartness, you'll find a rich vein of wild cherry, cranberry and cola fruit flavor. Ready now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This lush Chardonnay has a certain oiliness to the aromas, along with dusty, toasty components that ride through a soft, plush mid-palate. The fruit is a rich mix of peach and apricot, highlighted with toasted hazelnuts, vanilla and coconut.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Blocky and tart, this shows little of the flower or delicate citrus notes that many Oregon Rieslings convey. The clean apple flavor makes it good for summer picnics.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Here is a smoky, dense Primitivo with thick aromas of black cherry, red apples and chocolate fudge. The wine has a soft, modern edge with flavors of spice, vanilla and mature blackberry fruit. Pair it with lamb, roasted pork or stew.",Italy-Southern Italy-Primitivo
"Ferns, yeast and citrus come together in an appetizing trio of flavor. The palate is fluid and slightly rounded, but still light. There is a zesty, phenolic texture and lots of freshness on the concentrated palate. The finish is clean-cut and lip-smacking.",Austria-Weinviertel-Grüner Veltliner
"Perfumed, minty wine, very solidly structured, while also showing delicious red berry fruits. The tannins have a distinct mineral character, chewy although well integrated with the fruit.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Yeasty, toasty aromas come with notes of brown sugar and baking spices. Lively and good on the palate, this tastes of dry citrus fruits and nectarine. A fresh-feeling, citrusy finish is clean and firm.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Smooth yet crisp, this has attractive acidity and strawberry fruit. It is poised and elegant, with just the right amount of acidity.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Black-fruit aromas are made more complex by notes of leather and oak. This is full, blocky and tannic on the palate, with dark-fruit flavors of black plum and blackberry touched up by oak. A woody but long finish suggests that this will find its prime in a couple of years; drink through 2024.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This behemoth is all gristle and power, voluptuously combining 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 36% Malbec, 9% Petit Verdot, 5% Merlot, 4% Syrah and 2% Carmenere in a mad scientist's way. Velvety, it's beyond full-bodied in blackberry and chocolate, integrated in terms of oak, with a splash of black pepper and tobacco on the finish. Drink now through 2022.",US-California-Red Blend
"A strong whiff of new French oak hits the nostrils when this is first opened, but with some airing it develops into an excellent, deeply concentrated Chardonnay. Apple, pear, melon and papaya flavors are all in play, with enough natural acidity to keep the wine lively and fresh. The finish has ample toast, and rolls along through a smooth and satisfying conclusion.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Rich and fancy in the popular style, showing lots of tropical and citrus fruit, honey, mineral, vanilla, lees and oak flavors, wrapped into a buttery, creamy texture. Brisk coastal acidity provides a pleasant tartness.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Properly structured, this is a solid wine. Great swathes of plum fruits are partnered with firm tannins. It is dark and firm, with a dense character. Touches of chocolate and roasted coffee go with the rich plums. Drink from 2015.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This single-vineyard Tempranillo opens with smooth, straightforward dark-fruit aromas that are calm and collected. A deeply stacked palate is a touch fierce but well structured. Toasty blackberry and cherry flavors linger on a toast-etched finish. Drink through 2032.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Spicier than most Cab Francs, with a scour of pepper, but lush and flavorful in red cherries, tobacco and sandalwood. Easy to drink, this fine red wine has lots of interest. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Thanks to long maceration and fermentation on the skins, this has heady aromas of Spanish broom, acacia, yellow stone fruit, grilled herb and a whiff of baked bread. Round, savory and fresh, the intriguing palate has an impressive depth of flavors including ripe yellow peach, mature yellow apple, lemon drop, toasted almond, flinty mineral and an earthy note of tilled soil. Tangy acidity brightens the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Vernaccia
"This 100% varietal wine offers lightly volatile notes of vanilla, coconut, pepper and dried cherries. The fruit flavors show good concentration along with a beguiling feel and a finish that lingers. Although the wood takes center stage, it plays its part well.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Frankly sweet, this Riesling, made only from cool coastal grapes, benefits from crisp acidity. The tartness balances the sugary peach, citrus and honeysuckle flavors.",US-California-Riesling
"Solid, very structured, packed with dense and dry tannins. There is a core of acidity and darkness that gives the wine a brooding, powerful character. At this stage, it seems austere although it does have the weight of fruit typical of the year.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This fabulous wine comes from a legendary Vintage Port year. Aged in wood and only bottled in 2015, it is so concentrated and intense. The old gold and wood flavors are dominant in a beautiful wine that may be old but certainly has every possible nuance of flavor. It is one in a succession of rare and treasured Ports that occasionally emerge from Port producers cellars. Drink now.",Portugal-Port-Port
"A very ripe and sweet-smelling wine with thick concentration and deep tones of blackberry, black currant and clove.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Only 6,000 bottles and 300 magnums have been made of this wine, from a parcel in the famed La Landonne vineyard. This is a beautifully crafted wine, with vanilla and polished violet perfumes. To taste, the ripeness of the tannins and the richness of the fruit give both complexity and elegance. It should age for at least 15 years.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This certainly has maturity, giving it toasty flavors and a touch of oxidation. But it balances that with ripe yellow fruit, ripe acidity and a firm texture. It's rich and complex, balancing ripe fruit and more a rounded finish. Don't age it, though—enjoy it with food now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"An aroma of toasted hazelnut is at the fore, and subtle notes of honeyed toast, beeswax and brown spice lurk in the background. The glossy texture is threaded with a nutty melon flavor that continues onto the medium-long finish.",US-Virginia-Chardonnay
"This tasty bottle does not push for maximum ripeness, settling comfortably into a ripe-enough mix of apples, pears and nectarines. There's a dusting of cinnamon and even a little hint of brown sugar, though the wine is definitely finished dry. The balance holds true through a medium-long finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"This wine is all varietal, coming from one of the state's top sites. Despite the warm vintage and site, it opens with aromas of herbs along with barrel spice and tightly wound dark fruit. The black fruit flavors are fresh and lively, showing elegance and persistence with a tight core of fine grained tannins.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Io has a really good track record with this Syrah, which is grown in Paso Robles. The '06 is intricately structured, a dry wine with complex flavors of blackberries, currants, dates, mocha, leather, grilled meat, pepper and vanilla. Hard to resist drinking it now, but it should evolve in interesting ways over the next six years.",US-California-Syrah
"This is an enormous Cabernet, as packed with intensity and power as anything in Napa Valley. The vineyard is Von Strasser's highest on the mountain, which maximally exposes it to the sun, and you can taste the solar ripeness in the intense essence of black currants and dark chocolate. The tannins exhibit classic Diamond Mountain potency. This is a dense Cabernet that needs serious time in the cellar. Hold until 2019, and it will continue to develop for many years afterward.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Strongly woody at this stage, this wine does have the potential to reveal ripe fruits and a generous structure. Smoky flavors are beginning to balance with broad red fruits and acidity. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine has a hot-pink color, effusive strawberry and cherry aromas and then sweet fruit flavors that give a sugary impression on the palate. It's very simple in approach and low in alcohol.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A bold aroma of warm salted butter melds with notes of undergrowth, dark cherry and raspberry. Malleable at first, the palate becomes jolted by elevated acids, making the wine feel edgy on the finish.",US-Virginia-Cabernet Franc
"After the scent of char blows off a bit, this first harvest Merlot opens sweetly to aromas of vanilla, cinnamon spice and plush, red plums. There's a hint of green stalks and leaves detectable on the palate amidst underripe black cherry and plum flavors, but bright acidity gives this wine a fresh character and the spiced plum finish is pleasant.",US-New York-Merlot
"A nutty, pastry-like aroma and rather sweet fruit flavors make this wine fresh and outgoing. The sparkling texture is smooth and the body is rather light. It's best for dessert or with salty cheeses.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"The Adelaide Hills is one of Australia's best sources of high-quality Chardonnay. This is a fine example, marrying toasted grain aromas with peach and citrus flavors and a touch of vanilla. It's soft, lush and promises easy drinking over the next year or two.",Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"The aromas of whole lime, flowers, jasmine and watermelon Jolly Rancher pop. It drinks off dry, with floral flavors that carry through the finish.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Vranken's releases seem to be bucking the trend towards drier Champagnes. This wine is soft and obviously the dosage is high. It is balanced and the fresh creamed apple flavors and light texture all work well together. It is in a light style, ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Giant out of the blocks, this full-bodied, midnight-black bruiser delivers a heavy blast of graphite, vanilla, coconut, char and blackberry on the nose. A heavy, tannic, borderline syrupy palate is appropriate for flavors of toasted coconut, vanilla and oak. A chocolaty finish loaded with barrel resin is rich and heady. This is an extracted heavyweight from a warm year. Some will love it; others will find it too oaky and overripe. Drink through 2021.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"Deep garnet in the glass, this wine has a heady bouquet of black cherry, mocha and lavender. It is full in the mouth with supple tannins and a surprisingly refreshing acid backbone. Flavors of cherry, blueberry, espresso, chocolate and anise culminate in a cool, lingering finish with a soft floral lift.",Israel-Galilee-Cabernet Sauvignon
"For lovers of sophisticated Italian wine, Schidione (a hearty blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Merlot) shows personality, elegance and impressive intensity. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich. An excellent addition to a cellar collection.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Shows jammy flavors of blackberries and cherries, lightly touched with sweet, smoky oak. It's a bit rough in tannins, with some green notes, but at this price, a pretty good value.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Not too many Port-style wines are made from Chardonnay, as this one is. The residual sugar is 6%, but it's not a very good wine. Tastes cooked or stewed in pineapple, and the high alcohol makes for a burnt feeling.",US-California-Port
"Warm cherry fruit enfolds the palate, with supporting, lemony acids. This subtle, graceful wine both intrigues and invites, still promising a bit more than it delivers, but holding the potential for future greatness. Cellar it and try again 2018–2025.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
This is an easy Pinot Grigio that can be employed during informal drinking occasions. Bright citrus and melon ride an easy and somewhat short finish. Try it with Chinese take-out.,Italy-Veneto-Pinot Grigio
"This spicy wine is full of botrytis, giving a dry edge to its rich, honeyed flavors. It has an intense character, hovering between very sweet and dry. Structured with strong acidity, it will be ready to drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This winery's bottlings manage to pack bright, fruity energy and a wide array of herbs and seasonings into the same lithe frame. In this case, sagebrush and chaparral meet candied red cherry and dark pomegranate on the nose. The palate shows lots of oregano, thyme and bay leaf against a ripe cranberry base, with touches of black tea and rosehip adding to the complexity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"There are two kinds of great California Pinots: delicate and massive. This is massive. It's dark, tannic and powerful in fruit, but is so rich, so complex and interesting, you just can't keep from drinking it. Explodes with black cherry, currant, cola, mocha and smoky spice flavors. Now through 2012.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This well-balanced, off-dry wine has a fine line of acidity to balance its gentle sweetness. It features flavors of vanilla and baked apples. The wine could be matched with fruit desserts, but it is best consumed on its own.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This simple wine is thick with fruit-forward dark cherry and currant elements that find companionship in coffee, graphite and dried herb accents.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah, this opens with plush tones of blackberry and cherry, backed by savory accents of spice, smoke and black pepper. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"El Coro is a block in the Petaluma Gap estate vineyard that is exposed to the winds. That may account for the wine's tight, closed quality. It's brisk in acidity and strong in tannins, although it preserves Pinot's light, silky texture. The fruits are intensely concentrated in raspberries, cranberries and currants. No reason why this Pinot shouldn't develop in the bottle beyond 2018.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Coming from a classic limestone vineyard, this is tense, structured and tight. It is textured, with spice and tangy acidity giving some complexity to the otherwise fruity wine. Drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Bright and refreshing, this opens with white spring flower and yellow stone fruit aromas. The linear palate evokes yellow peach, mature apple and juicy nectarine, brightened with tangy acidity. It finishes clean and crisp.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Ribolla Gialla
"This comes from a parcel of red clay that is not found elsewhere in the region. It gives a powerful and hugely dense wine that boasts good concentration and ripe black fruits. There is no sense of any aging yet on this impressive wine with its acidity and opulent ripeness still intact. Drink now, although the wine will age for many years, certainly until 2025.",France-Southwest France-Red Blend
"This well-extracted and mature expression of Nebbiolo from the Antinori estate in Piedmont is a mature and fruit-driven expression of Barbaresco with dense concentration and a New World style. There's very good complexity here in the form of black licorice, chopped mint and rhubarb.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Situated in the Tarn River valley, south of Cahors and west of Toulouse, this estate has turned towards Bordeaux in its choice of grapes. The wine has structure, tense tannins as well as black currant fruit flavors. It's a rich, generous wine, and with its acidity and firm background it will age. Drink from 2018.",France-Southwest France-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The wine is tight and nervy, very fresh, crisp and citrus dominated. It delivers a cool feel and delicious acidity that brings out a light character, as well as a bone-dry, mineral aftertaste.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This tastes of great Cabernet Sauvignon, with its black currant, cedar and herbs and fresh, juicy acidity. It is as fresh as it is rich, but it has a structure of dense tannins that balances the wine. This is one of the best wines from Gruaud-Larose for several years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This intensely aromatic wine has perfumes of peach, apricot and ripe plum. These fruits dominate the warm, ripe palate, with just a hint of minerality.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Riesling
"Choppy plum and berry aromas are mildly raw and herbaceous, but not overly so. Round and standard in feel, this Malbec tastes of creamy, herbal berry fruits that turn slightly green and oaky. Peppery, medicinal, herbal flavors drive the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Earth, tree bark, dry spice and finally some plum and berry aromas appear on the nose. The palate is astringent but also bright and structured, with plum, raspberry and herbal flavors. Warming and tannic all the way to the very end. A very nice and forceful Toro.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"Vanilla, barrel spice, coffee and dark fruit aromas are followed by generous black fruit and barrel flavors that show exquisite balance. It's impossible not to enjoy.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lots of bright, fresh fruit in this jammy wine. Bursts with pineapples, nectarines, sweet lemon chiffon pie, green-apple jelly, buttered toast and honey vanilla, wrapped into a creamy texture. Production was 3,100 cases.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Fresh pressed blackberry and boysenberry scents meet wet clay and gravel on the nose of this bottling from one of Paso Robles' cooler corners. Vibrant acidity shows on the palate, with light tannins that frame its plump berry and graphite flavors.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This ripe wine from a warm year is raisiny up front, with additional scents of molasses and baked plum. Choppy, clampy tannins frame oaky flavors of red plum and raspberry, while oak spice and resiny flavors push a woody finish that includes a strong minty accent. This is 85% Monastrell and 15% Syrah.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"Toasted aromas include popcorn and baked apple. The palate is medium in weight and features racy acidity and not much midpalate. Flavors of oak-driven spice and white fruits lead to a fast-moving, acidic finish, with leftover spice and resin notes.",Chile-Limarí Valley-Chardonnay
"Drink this tannicly youthful wine now and for the next few years with chops and steaks. It's dry and vibrant in blackberries, currants and licorice, and possesses real class and elegance.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"A worthy followup to the splendid 2008 and 2009 vintages, this 100% Cabernet is a blend of grapes from St. Helena, Rutherford and Oakville. It defines Napa Cabernet with lush, intricate and complex favors of blackberry jam, cassis liqueur, milk chocolate and caramelized oak that finish dry and long. The tannins are refined, but thick. This is a wine for the cellar. Start enjoying it after 2017.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Simple and sweet, with candied, jammy flavors of cherries, blackberries and licorice. Drink now.",US-California-Syrah
"This wine smells like toasted bread, salt and black pepper, and tastes like a grilled steak, with smoke and blackberry accents. The tannin meter goes high, as the varietal's notorious thick texture and controlled astringency show through. Best to hold this and drink after 2019.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Its borderline weedy aromas are abrasive. This has a drawn-in tannic palate with citrusy acidity. Briary herbal berry and red-plum flavors are green in the middle, while this is unyielding and herbal tasting on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Franc
"The cold vintage compromised this wine, giving it high acidity and unripe flavors of green peppercorns, citrus fruits, dried hay and ammonia.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This tight, classic Russian River Valley Pinot Noir needs coaxing to bring out the lovely, lilting aromatics, splendid in savory dark fruit, cinnamon and tobacco. Restrained use of new oak brings a balance of richness and acidity, softened tannins and velvety texture that works in every way.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is ripe and pungent, a rich and fruit-driven mix of fig, peach and melon. There are interesting herbal highlights, and more acidity than in the past. The thyme and rosemary streak continues into and through the finish, while the fruit maintains its power and polish, with just the lightest barrel influence perceptible in a kiss of toast.",US-Washington-Sémillon
"A common thread among the 2015 Soléna Pinots is a stiff herbal beet flavor rather than fully ripe berry fruit. This tilts into cranberry and very tart raspberry, but finishes astringent and hard. Give it plenty of decanting (two or three hours) to help it open up.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Smoky, yeasty aromas of burnt orange are spicy and good. This shows a citrusy palate with give and depth along with nectarine, yeast and smoky flavors. Toasty barrel influences are noticeable on the finish, which is moderately sophisticated.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Sparkling Blend
"This Pinot's parts haven't found each other yet. There's big, ripe raspberry and cherry fruit, sweet, toasty oak, brisk acids and firm tannins, yet they form an unruly confederation. Stash this in the cellar until at least 2020.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a beautiful and highly recommended white that is deliciously redolent of honey, stone fruit, pear, bee's wax and wild sage. The nose has good complexity and the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with good length on the finish.",Italy-Southern Italy-Fiano
"There is some ripe melon fruitiness that gives the wine richness. By contrast, there is little structure or crisp acidity to give it life.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"A blend of 52% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Cabernet Franc and 6% Petit Verdot, this wine is aromatically brooding with notes of coffee, mineral, flowers and cherry. The palate boasts abundant coffee and cherry flavors backed by firm tannins that need time in the cellar to stretch their legs. Best after 2021, with a long life ahead of it.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Pure Cabernet, ageworthy wine. Right now it is quite tight, somewhat herbal and compact. The fruit is layered, a range from strawberry through cherry and into cassis, and it leads sharply into spicy tannins with a clear edge.

This is a wine you may enjoy immediately and on through 2025.",US-Oregon-Syrah
"The home chateau of the group of properties owned by the Guyon family, this estate has produced a solid very ageworthy wine. It has dark tannins and rich juicy black fruits. With its structure and bright berry and plum flavors, it will not be ready to drink before 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Sourced from the Lonesome Spring Ranch vineyard, this pure Barbera offers light cranberry fruit flavors, tart and puckery, retaining a sense of freshness despite being released more than four years after the vintage. Pretty cherry candy flavors come up in the back, leaving a pleasing impression. Drink up soon before the wine starts to fade.",US-Washington-Barbera
"Easy to enjoy for its straightforward flavors and balance, this medium-bodied wine smells like black cherries and strawberries, tastes fruity and moderately rich and is also shaded by vanilla and maple, adding complexity and a touch of sweetness.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A very oaky style of Malbec. The bouquet is full of cough drop, milk chocolate and mint, while the palate feels solid and beefy, but resiny. Flavors of berry fruits are softened and sweetened by oak and chocolate, while the finish is woody and tannic.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Tilled earth, game, red berry and orange peel aromas lead the nose on this concentrated wine. The ripe, savory palate delivers fleshy sour cherry, crushed raspberry, notes of baking spice, mineral and a suggestion of game. It's delicious, with an earthy charm that gives it a distinct character.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Frappato
"A fine wine that shows the complexity and volume of the Santa Lucia Highlands. The wine is thoroughly dry and fairly full-bodied for a Pinot Noir, offering rich black cherry, currant and mineral flavors. Its depth and sturdy tannins suggest cellaring for 5–6 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"While not a generally declared year, 2012 has produced some excellent single-quinta wines. This full, ripe wine was fermented in open stone tanks and then kept in old wood for 12 months. It is richly structured with fine black fruit and a powerful aftertaste. Age this until 2024.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Tropical and slightly reduced, this complex wine from the famous Westside Road site is peachy and dripping in caramel. Baked apple adds to the lush, plush and richly robust palate, which finishes with balanced acidity and a taste of salty pretzel.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Fresh tomato, plum, herb and spice aromas are authentic. A medium bodied palate is lifted and elegant. Flavors of woody spice, light herb, raspberry and red plum finish racy, with hints of cocoa and white pepper. Among Chilean Pinot Noirs, this is at the top of its field.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Pinot Noir
"Those who seek out Gewürztraminer for its intense, exotic nose will want to look elsewhere. Despite the subtle aromatic profile, the rich palate is bursting with flavors of rose water, spice and cloves. It finishes fairly dry, with just a hint of residual sugar.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"This is the reserve of the Erath lineup and the winery's best effort—along with the Battle Creek bottling—in 2010. Pretty scents and flavors of raspberry and rose water mingle with the ripest cherry fruit in the lineup. Focused, balanced and elegant.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Too sweet in residual sugary flavors to earn a higher score, this Merlot shows jellied cherry and blackberry flavors. Those who like their red wines sweet will enjoy it.",US-California-Merlot
"88—90 Barrel sample. Spicy, rich, concentrated, with sweet vanilla flavors over the blackberry fruits. Soft and ripe, a wine that is made to charm.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is easy to recognize thanks to its distinctive intensity and opulence. This 2007 may be the best bottling yet. It oozes with sweet flavors of cardamom, cinnamon, crushed clove, nutmeg and all kinds of ripe berry fruit. There's a firm tannic bite on the finish, which is followed by long-lasting succulent sweetness.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Boldly etched with milk chocolate and baked plum notes, this wine is ripe, robust and jammy in spirit. Leather, black pepper and cinnamon accents season it nicely.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Aromas of black-skinned fruit, leather, underbrush, game and a briny note all carry over to the lean, somewhat disjointed palate along with suggestions of licorice and raw red cherry. Grainy tannins leave a drying finish.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"Attractive white Bordeaux blend, much better than the red from the same estate. It has a delicious ripe fruit character with pineapple, lime and kiwi flavors and final acidity.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This has a vibrant yellow-gold color and aromas like fresh herbs and sliced celery. Almost electric acidity pulses in the crisp grapefruit, lime and melon flavors that lead to a lingering finish. The vivid freshness and tangy texture sets it apart from the crowd, and it will work wonderfully with foods from raw oysters to roast chicken.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine's light and refreshing nose cuts between orange-blossom ripeness, lime-juice sharpness, chalky minerality and a touch of milk fat. There is good energy on the palate, powered by tart green apple rinds and citrus zest.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Owner Molly Chappellet's beloved baby, this white is deliciously crisp, dry and balanced, with layers of Meyer lemon, waxy apple and floral gardenia. Percolating acidity maintains its freshness beneath its rich texture and tropical succulence.",US-California-Chenin Blanc
"This Maipo estate is now aligned with Chateau Ste. Michelle of Washington, which doesn't exactly impact this nice everyday Cabernet. Bramble and fresh berry aromas offer an entry, then there's chewy raspberry on the palate along with a grace of vanilla and some warmth. A bone-warming wine for fall and winter.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This comes from a popular vineyard in the Los Alamos Valley, and offers nose-tingling aromas of black pepper, tar and a slightly sour take on purple fruit. It's not as exciting as some of the winery's other wines, but still serves as a solid take on the grape, mixing ripe fruit, crushed herbs and brown spice.",US-California-Syrah
"Briny citrus and grapefruit aromas are controlled. This feels simple and a bit hollow, while pyrazine-based flavors of grapefruit and green veggies finish bland, with lingering citrus notes.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"A well-balanced mix of highlights: dried herbs, dusty cherry fruit, and a streak of citrus come together in this estate-grown wine. It finishes with a lick of caramel, from aging in 22% new oak.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"The fruit is light and almost delicate, suggesting mountain strawberries and sour plums. The one-year-old French oak still imparts a significant burst of bourbon barrel flavor, especially in the finish, which resonates like a bourbon and chocolate bon-bon.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"The vineyard is in the Chehalem Mountains AVA, and here it yields an aromatic wine, with inviting suggestions of buttery cherry pie. It also offers blueberries, a touch of light herb and a deliciously smooth mouthfeel.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This gorgeous Chianti Classico boasts lively cherry, strawberry and violet aromas. The mouthwatering palate shows concentrated wild-cherry flavor layered with mint, white pepper and clove. It has fresh acidity and firm tannins that will develop complexity with more bottle age. A textbook Chianti Classico.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Sourced from the Dineen vineyard in the heart of the Yakima valley, this cool site in a cool vintage puts the emphasis on botanical aromatics and a  vivid, penetrating palate of citrus skin and flesh.",US-Washington-Viognier
"Subtle and elegant, this opens with a smoky aroma that underscores delicate scents of orchard fruit, citrus and botanical herb. The aromas follow through to the linear palate along with a racy mineral vein. A note of cured meat closes the racy finish.",Italy-Southern Italy-Fiano
"This soft, ready-to-drink wine is all about black-currant fruitiness, with only the lightest of tannins. Juicy, fresh acidity finishes an attractive wine.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"88-90 Barrel sample. Light, ripe, fresh with pleasant acidity and the freshest of blackcurrants.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Hailing from one of the state's most esteemed vineyard sites, this wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon and just over a quarter Merlot, with the balance Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. The oak (40% new French) is dialed back, allowing rich, layered notes of plum, herbs, licorice, toast and coffee to rise with a firm scaffolding of slightly dry tannins supporting them. Still young, it will be best after 2018.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine tastes rather light and lean. The aromas are like cherry and apple candy, and the flavors resemble not-quite-ripe red cherries and raspberries. It is dry and medium bodied.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a fragrant, spicy wine that is shot through with red fruits and fine acidity. The 95% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is still firm with its tannins although the acidity and bright fruit are well in balance. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Intense violet, red-skinned berry and cooking spice aromas set the stage in this bright red. The lively palate delivers red cherry, blackberry and cinnamon touches alongside round tannins and lively acidity. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"Coffee grinds, raisin and baked aromas suggest overripeness. This is heavy, broad and a bit clumsy on the palate. Berry and prune flavors are solid but not overly fresh, while the finish is full and raisiny as it improves over time.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Sumptuous on the nose with aromas of lychee, rose petals and honeycomb, this is a powerful, classically styled Gewürztraminer. On the palate, it's dry yet juicy with melon and stone fruit flavor. Enjoy now for its voluptuous exuberance.",US-New York-Gewürztraminer
"The wine comes from the Leflaive home village and the blend (from more than 20 parcels) demonstrates the intimate knowledge the family has with its terroir. It has a fine balance between the ripe yellow and white stone fruits and acidity. These are given structure by the wood aging and strong mineral texture. This is still developing and still filling out, so drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Dried red raspberry and pomegranate fruits mix with a persistent leathery character and spicy nutmeg on the nose of this wine. Cranberries and cooked berries show on the tart palate, which is driven by graphite, minerals and slightly chunky tannins.",US-California-Sangiovese
"Earthy aromas of white mushroom and dried roses that are characteristic of Tuscan Sangiovese are what you notice first here. The wine then segues to fruit and spice aromas, although those berry notes are on the mature and jammy side. Fresh acidity and firm tannins suggest a pairing with red meat.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"San Calisto is a rich, pulpy and concentrated wine, with an inky black appearance and savory aromas of black pepper, clove, leather, tobacco and loads of mature jammy blackberry. The finish is smooth, velvety and bright.",Italy-Central Italy-Montepulciano
"Stewed cherry, exotic cardamom and mace spices and hints of juniper and bay leaf bring an earthy component to the nose of this Pinot. Dark cranberry and black-plum-skin flavors meet with earth tones of turned loam, pine needle and menthol on the palate.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"An intimidating wine in that it's dark, huge and heavy. The nose is a roasted mass of tar, rubber, smoke and baked berry fruit. It's thick and fleshy in the mouth, with flavors of cola, chocolate, blackberry and blueberry. Minty and warm late, and overall it's more about color and size than refinement.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Bright, tangy, lean and appetizing, this light-bodied wine has mouth-cleansing acidity, lemon and green apple flavors, a zingy balance and clean, dry finish. Time to bring on the oysters or goat cheese.",US-California-Sémillon
"This opens with aromas of leather, sage, mature black-skinned fruit and a balsamic note. The palate offers toasted notes, espresso, spiced plum and dried blackberry alongside chewy, drying tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Slightly rubbery on first impression, but cleaner and better as it opens up. Zesty and full of acidic punch, with juicy black cherry and plum flavors. Registers as healthy and ripe, with a spot of medicinality. Quite good for the price.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This is a carefully made, almost calculated wine that showcases controlled herbaceousness around tight, crisp black fruits. The mix evokes earth, herb, barrel and grape.",US-Washington-Merlot
"The nose on this estate wine emerges slowly with enough sniffing, offering white peach, white flowers and honeydew. It's a fruit salad of flavors once sipped, suggesting melons and apples tossed in citrus vinaigrette.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Olallieberry fruit, charred meats and a bit of oak smoke introduce the nose of this wine from a newly renamed vineyard in the middle of Santa Ynez Valley, where Paul Hobbs recently signed on as consultant. Flavors are led by tar and herbs, with ripe purple fruit and black pepper arising on the midpalate and finish.",US-California-Syrah
"Big, burly Pinot Noir, dominated by black cherries, rich fruit and firm tannins. This is wine that shows richness, with a smoky, chewy structure and great spice and aromatic perfumes. The juiciness comes through on the finish, but never leaves the structure behind.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Still fresh, this shows red currant and red berry fruit flavors over a smoky layer of wood, licorice and spice. It has some warmth, a smoothly textured wine that only has a glimpse of rustic tannin beneath the flavors.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Partially aged in oak, this wine is crisp, juicy and bright with citrus and acidity. Apples and pears come through strongly in this attractive wine that is ready to drink.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"This opens with attractive aromas of pressed rose, woodland berry, dried herb and a whiff of baking spice. The robust palate shows sour, almost unripe cherry, clove, mocha and anisette. The warmth of evident alcohol closes the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"89–91. Barrel sample. In its ninth harvest as the Médoc bottling from Château Cos d'Estournel, Goulée is coming into its own as the vineyard matures. The palate is nicely concentrated with chocolate and black-currant fruits, followed by an herbal hint on the finish.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a smooth and soft wine that will develop quickly. It has a light tannin structure behind the easy blackberry fruit. The chateau is owned by Castel, the largest drinks producer in France. Drink this attractive wine from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"From a section of the rocky vineyard planted to the Martini clone, a thick-skinned grape, Deer Camp is full bodied, densely concentrated and marked by a streak of spiciness throughout. It's perfumed with roses and forest floor, while it presents a texture that is seductively velvety and smooth.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Rich but balanced aromas of caramel, vanilla, blueberry pie with buttery crust, allspice, clove and mace whirl into an amazingly seductive nose on this wine by former NFL star Terry Hoage. It's luscious on the palate, with Vietnamese coffee, burnt caramel, black cherries, blueberry paste and smoked oak, yet balanced and tingling with acidity throughout.",US-California-Syrah
"This begins with a bucketload of dense and brooding aromas, from macerated plums and cherries to dark chocolate and melted black licorice sticks. It's soft and mouth-coating once sipped, with pronounced tannins on the midpalate, flavors of black cherry and olallieberry, a bit of tarry tension and minty sensation on the finish.",US-California-Tannat
"Equal parts malbec and merlot with the balance (8%) petit verdot, it smells quite fruity with notes of plum and berry along with peat and bubblegum. There's no noticeable oak influence (all two year old and neutral barrels) to distract from the smooth fruit flavors and bright acidity.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Distinctive aromas of beeswax and bee pollen continue with similar flavors, wrapped around tart yellow apple fruit. It's lovely, fragrant and ageworthy, in a high-acid Euro mold, but give it plenty of time to breathe. Decanting is a good idea.",US-Oregon-Pinot Blanc
"This is distinguished for its deeply-rich mouthfeel and creamy aromas of stone fruit, honeydew and crushed almond. There's a point of crisp acidity that's refreshing.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"From an Umpqua Valley vineyard, this solid and fruit-driven Pinot Gris needs a little more bottle age to come together. The pear fruit flavor is there in abundance, but some off-notes creep in, damping the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"This rich and structured wine is packed with both ripe black fruits and concentrated tannins. It is a big wine, a fine representation of this appellation with its dense flavors and aging potential. The wine should be ready from 2021.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Grapy aromas suggest minerals and iodine along with wet animal fur and plum. It's firm and tannic on the palate, with herbal, rooty plum and berry flavors and a tight finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Ultra Brut, the original no-dosage Champagne, is the name and that's just how this bone-dry wine tastes. It's totally crisp, fruity, structured and fresh. Acidity from tight citrus combines with apples and pears to produce a wine that offers both fruitiness and dryness. Like many super-dry Champagnes, it will benefit from some bottle aging, so drink at least six months after purchase.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This smells rubbery, with oaky spice, but airing allows it to expand across a lively palate. Herbal, spicy red-berry flavors are strongest in the midpalate, while peppery flavors, rubbery tannins and scratchiness define the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"While the nose wants to give little away, the palate speaks of crunchy, fresh red cherry. The medium body carries this fruit with ease and gives the necessary structure. The tenor of this is playful, fruit forward and most enjoyable, with a suitably peppery finish. Drink soon.",Austria-Burgenland-Austrian Red Blend
"Voluptuous and broad, this richly textured auslese suggests soft yellow apples and fleshy tangerines. It's a bit fat on the palate, but sunny acidity lends some freshness on the midpalate. Drink now.",Germany-Rheinhessen-Riesling
"Dark in color and extracted on the nose, with prune, cassis and chocolate aromas, this Carmenère-led blend feels full and plush, not tannic and rough. Blackberry, balsamic notes and spice flavors finish long, ripe and spicy. Drink this meaty wine through 2023.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Red Blend
"With its fresh prickle on the tongue and off-dry character, this is an easy, lemon-candy flavored wine that is best drunk young and well chilled. The finish is fresh and crisp.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White
"A rather closed nose leads to a citric, ever so slightly peppery palate. The body approaches on light feet, with an almost weightless freshness. If you like it feather-light, this is your wine, just a silky touch of bracing acidity and an ultraclean finish.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"This is a rich, smooth, vanilla-flavored wine that is impressively ripe while keeping all its freshness. It has a sense of concentration, with ripe strawberry and red cherry fruits and enough structure to allow it to age. Drink from 2015.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Almost as sweet as a dessert wine, this Viognier has flavors of white sugar and a fruit juice blend of oranges, mangoes and peaches.",US-California-Viognier
"The Indian Wells Cabernet Sauvignon seems a little reductive at the moment; odd, since the 2005 vintage was forward, almost fat, and the wine has been in bottle for quite some time. It should definitely be decanted and aired out before serving, which will help to push the fruit flavors forward. The finish is just slightly dilute, but the wine is well-made and may just be suffering from some of the occasional dumbness that strikes Cabernet.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A little off in texture, with a grainy mouthfeel that's part tart acids and part edgy tannins. However, it's lusty in forward cherry and raspberry fruit flavors, and will surely satisfy many Pinotphiles.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"With a dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, this structured and firm wine has a dry, dusty character lightened by black currant fruitiness. The aftertaste, with its good mix of fruit and acidity shows a wine that's likely to be ready to drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Cherry cola, licorice, fresh berry fruit, cigar box and smoky tobacco give this wine a bright, albeit slightly rustic, personality. In the mouth, it shows nicely balanced acidity and tannins, providing extra length to the dry, elegant finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"This tastes like a warm climate, soft, round Cabernet, full-bodied and etched in dark, smoky tannins. The alcohol reaches 14.8% but does not burn; the fruit is a mix of figs and plums and ripe black cherries. Already four years old, it's drinking very well now and may be at its best over the next couple of years.",US-Oregon-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This combines all five red Bordeaux varieties, with half of the wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon. Juicy black cherry, cedar and integrated oak make for a straightforward, light-bodied and high-toned experience in the glass.",US-California-Meritage
"Sharp and focused, with fine-tuned varietal expression, this is flat out loaded with rich fruit flavors. Orange, lime, pineapple and pear can be found, all beautifully polished. It's ripe and precise without being bitter or hot, and a fine value as well.",US-Oregon-Viognier
"At this stage, the wine seems to have too much wood. Hopefully this will dissipate because round yellow fruits are all there, along with fresh, crisp acidity. It is a wine with potential and will be better from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A little sugary-sweet, but the acidity is so crisp and clean, it balances things out. The pineapple, papaya, peach jam, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors are really delicious.",US-California-Viognier
"This fruity, one-dimensional wine has flavors of blackberries, brown sugar and caramelized oak. The tannins are nice and thick, suggesting grilled meats for pairings.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Open, soft, creamy, along with a candied fruit character. There is freshness here, with the acidity dominant on the finish.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Showing moderate body and made in a drier style, the wine offers a hint of earthiness that's followed by pretty melon, peach, herb and citrus flavors. Crisp and clean on the finish, with a toasty, fruity hint at the end. More complex than   many of the local Rieslings.",US-California-Riesling
"A fruity nose of red currants and cooked cherries shows how well Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton achieve balance amidst ripeness. The palate allows a little raspberry juice, yet is powered by dill, licorice, wet sagebrush, anise and pencil lead, proving savory and supple all at once.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This grape variety originated in Spain and is also popular in the southern Rhône Valley of France. In this bottling, smoky, chocolaty aromas lead to blackberry and dark cherry flavors, a broad, generous texture and moderate tannins. It's rather big in structure but not heavy.",US-California-Mourvèdre
"Dark in color and voluptuous in body and texture, this wine was aged in French oak, 35% of it new. With a sizable presence on the palate, it generously reveals brooding flavors of apple and pear.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Made with a blend of Friulano, Chardonnay, Sauvignon and Pinot Grigio, this opens with aromas of toasted oak and vanilla. The lean palate offers yellow apple skin, pineapple and mineral alongside brisk acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend
"Ripe and solid, this is a thoroughly enjoyable California example of this Rhône varietal. The wine presents an enticing bouquet of tropical fruits, floral scents, vanilla, even a hint of banana. The palate is medium weight, with citrus and more vanilla flavors. Closes nicely with light spice and toasty accents.",US-California-Viognier
"Strong's Symmetry almost qualifies as a Cabernet Sauvignon, with 71% of that variety, and the rest consisting of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. The Meritage labeling identifies it as their supreme bottling of a Bordeaux-style wine. Easily the best Symmetry ever, it is a great wine. Dry and somewhat astringent in tannins, it has an impressively deep core of blackberries and currants, with an array of sweet herbs, chocolate and tobacco. It's delicious now, and should slowly develop bottle complexities over the next 10 years.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Owned by the same family as Château Talbot in Saint-Julien, this vintage of Sénéjac is now mature, showing signs of leather and a firm structure rather than fruit. It's unlikely to develop further, so drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
This is a smooth wine with soft tannins cushioned by generous fruits. Its red-cherry acidity gives the lightest stalky edge and will allow the wine to age further. The partial barrel aging has added spice. Drink this fine wine from 2019.,France-Loire Valley-Pinot Noir
"There is no missing the power of this hugely concentrated wine. It comes from steep slopes above the Adour valley at the eastern end of the Madiran appellation. This rich wine, stlll young at five years, holds massive flavors of new wood and black fruit. Tannins march through showing no signs yet of softening as the superripe Tannat powers the wine forward. Drink from 2018.",France-Southwest France-Tannat-Cabernet
"The earthiness of Syrah dominates the aromas of this blended wine. The structure is dense and solid with perfume that elevates the black, juicy fruits. It is still beginning to integrate, so expect this fine wine to  age for at least 4–5 years.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese Red
"Overly sweet and simple, and something of a disappointment given the winery's past performance, this Syrah tastes like melted cherry jam, stirred with chocolate pie filling and sprinkled with fennel and pepper.",US-California-Syrah
"Dried, concentrated red fruit and raspberry syrup aromas combine for a delicious smelling nose on this wine from southern Monterey County, near Paso Robles. It is surprisingly thin and rough on the palate, with modest blueberry flavor and peppery spice.",US-California-Malbec
"Almost tooth-achingly sweet, this nectar still retains an amazing level of fruit purity. It's floral and apple-y in its aromas, then offers pineapple, honey and melon fruit flavors. There's even some lime zest on the finish to partially offset the succulent sweetness.",Germany-Mosel-Saar-Ruwer-Riesling
"The blend of Colombard, Gros Manseng and Sauvignon Blanc gives a light mineral character. The wine is very fresh, very crisp and finely layered, with a depth of herbaceous and green fruit flavors. Screwcap.",France-Southwest France-White Blend
"This delicious blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot opens with an intense, brooding fragrance of dark fruit, spice and leather. The palate delivers a concentrated black-cherry flavor that's framed by big, chewy tannins and  punctuated by spicy accents of white and black pepper, licorice and pipe. Drink 2015–2024.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Blueberry, dark berries and tar swirl together on the nose of this hedonistic wine from Mike Sinor's Bassi Ranch property, located just 1.3 miles from the ocean at Shell Beach. It's rich, meaty and heavily spiced on the palate, with dark chocolate, cedar and plenty of blackberry, but the bitter and savory elements stop it short of being a fruit bomb.",US-California-Syrah
"Clean and well made, but underwhelming. There's basic blueberry and blackberry flavors riding on a medium-bodied palate, but overall the wine is more generic than specific. It's easygoing and causes no red flags to go up, however at the end of the day it doesn't show much personality.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Bone dry and very acidic, almost sour, with watery flavors of orange and lemon cough drop candy. Gains a few points for elegance and cleanliness.",US-California-Rosé
"Pale peach in color, this wine offers pleasing aromas of watermelon and strawberry. It drinks just a hair off dry, with a light spritz that perks up the interest.",US-Washington-Rosé
"This good, generic red wine smells like mixed fruits and tastes mildly fruity along with light veggie flavors. It feels lean in texture and dry in balance.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This full-bodied wine has unapologetic late-harvest flavors like raisins and prunes dusted with dried herbs, and a firm texture that comes with alcoholic heat.",US-California-Zinfandel
This delicate yet straightforward wine has blue flower and baking spice aromas. Smooth tannins back up cherry jam and white pepper flavors on the palate. Drink soon.,Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto
"Pretty aromas of fresh white flowers and apple blossom open this mouthfilling, satisfying wine. Complex and interesting on the palate, it's layered with tension and acidity. It has a lean, clean finish that's dialed-in for the table.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Dominated by Sauvignon Blanc, this wine has a still young, crisp, tight character. As it ages, the yellow fruits and ripe plum flavors will come through, balancing the acidity and giving a ripe, full and generous wine. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Aromas of French oak, espresso and coconut lead the nose and follow through to the robust palate along with dried sour cherry, orange peel and clove. Tightly knit grainy tannins leave a somewhat astringent finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Light strawberry fruit with tart acidity carries a wine of modest proportions. It's drinking well, and might be a good choice for a simple salmon preparation, as it would not overwhelm the fish. The finishing tannins have a definite herbal flavor.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This interesting Cabernet shows blackberry and cassis flavors alongside earthy notes of green olive and mint. The acidity is sharp and keen. It's not going anywhere, so drink up.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Slightly oxidized at first with aromas of caramel and butterscotch, the wine soon opens to reveal apricot, honey and dried hay. It's an easy, genuine wine to pair with fried onion rings.",Italy-Central Italy-Verdicchio
"Aromas of cooked fruit, stewed plum, toast, coffee and vanilla lead the nose. The warm palate offers up fleshy black cherry, mocha and a licorice note, with the warmth of alcohol on the midpalate. It's already accessible so drink soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Although this Zin has a touch of overripeness in the form of raisins covered in chocolate, followed by a lot of blackberry and foxy mulberry. The wine is dry, smooth and balanced, with plenty of complexity.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A strongly herbal, garrigue character dominates the overall personality of this wine, but is supported by ample black plum and cherry notes to keep it from being overly earthy or green. Firm, slightly astringent tannins coat the palate and remain well into the finish.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Though single vineyard wines can be impressive, there are times when they'd be better as components in a blend. This is the case here. Just on the edge of sour, the very tart grapey flavors seem overtaken by acidity, without compensating depth or complexity.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"From one of Lazio's most promising wineries, this white blend of indigenous grapes delivers a fragrant bouquet of peach blossom, citrus, pear and apple. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky, with a touch of crisp freshness on the finish.",Italy-Central Italy-White Blend
"Black cherry and wild berry aromas are appealing and lusty. In the mouth, this blend of Sryah, Graciano, Tempranillo and Petit Verdot is solid but a bit thin in the middle. Flavors of raw oak, coffee and cherry finish with a wave of creamy oak. Despite its modest structure, this is a very good and interesting blend to drink now.",Spain-Central Spain-Red Blend
"With toasty wood-aging flavors, this is a rich, spicy wine. It has a note of nutmeg to balance the citrus- and apricot-like acidity and the ripe depth of flavor.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"The 2001 vintage was a good one for Gloria Ferrer, and this brut, made almost equally from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, is exceptionally delicious. It was held on the lees all this time, giving it a creamy yeastiness in addition to savory lime, strawberry and vanilla flavors. Drink now.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"The Santa Lucia Highlands are quickly becoming known for growing exceptional Pinot Noir, but this wine shows that the region also has potential for Bordeaux varieties. It's weedy, slightly green wine, but that's more than compensated for by the wonderfully lush and smooth texture and mouthfeel.",US-California-Meritage
"A caramel aroma is followed by sweet strawberry fruit from the Touriga Nacional, lending a wine that is freshly fruity and soft.",Portugal-Tejo-Rosé

"Lush cassis aromas are cut by black pepper and charcoal on the nose of this bottling by Las Vegas sommelier-turned-winemaker Paolo Barbieri, who was raised in Rome.

"The color is already fading into brick around the rim, and this light Merlot is already drinking at or near its peak. It's soft and smooth, slightly nutty, with round and mature fruit flavors of cherry and berry. All in all it's a pleasant, lightly toasty wine with no rough edges.",US-Oregon-Merlot
"The vineyard is far better known for powerful, concentrated Pinot Noir, and this Chardonnay shares those characteristics.

Could do interesting things over the years.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Aromas of tree bark, vanilla and herbs mix with peppery red fruit scents, while the palate is comfortable and herbal, with plum and dry oak notes. Peppery on the finish, and overall this is a nice but standard Chilean Cabernet that should strike most as being familiar.",Chile-Aconcagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a classic style of Cabernet that should improve with age.

It has fine-grained tannins, and a lingering dark chocolate and cherry finish. It will be best after 2018.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"With grapes from the estate vineyard, Minnick Hills, this promising effort opens with concentrated, dark berry fruit, backed with rich tannins.

"Aromas of commercial soap, cherry and crushed stone are candied, pushy and not easy. A choppy mouthfeel with shrill acidity is another tough road to travel. Flavors of cherry cough drop and coffee are hot prior to an abrupt hard-driving finish. Elegance is not a factor in this fruity bullish Italian-style blend of Malbec and Corvina.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend

"Wild berry, red rose, baking spice and a balsamic note meld together in the glass. The structured, savory palate doles out juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, cinnamon and tobacco. Bracing but refined tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018 through 2026.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Black-fruit aromas are accented by notes of licorice, green herbs and grass. This is full and chunky, but a bit hollow in mouthfeel. Pronounced tartaric acidity results in surface-level pop along with hollowness, while lactic oak and coconut flavors on the finish are familiar for Argentine Cabernet.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The red cherry fruit bears some mushroom notes among the cedar and clove accents, and there's a sense of hollowing-out that should not be evidenced at this age. It's light, showing some nice berry and spice flavors and a sweet woodiness. But it's too developed now for a 1997 riserva.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese

"Spicy clove flavors enwrap rounded tannin and integrated oak in this structured, bold and full-bodied wine. A reserve-tier bottling, it shows deep red fruit, from cassis to currant, and a predominance of both the savory and tart.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sleek, elegant and refined, this is a subtle, evocative and seamless wine. Layers of plum and black cherry, cola and earth, sea salt and caramel entwine gracefully. The 18 months in oak brings in sweet baking spices. Delicious already, it should drink very well at least through 2025.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Underbrush, pipe tobacco, blue-flower, berry and star anise aromas unfold in the glass. The firm, elegant palate offers dried cherry, clove, mint and orange peel alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2025.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Opaque in color, with herbal aromas that include graphite, tobacco, sweaty leather and mocha along with floral berry fruits. The acidity is high due to coastal origins, so the blackberry flavors run tangy, with herbal leanings. Streaky, sharp acidity is the only sticking point.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Syrah
"From Charlie Chenoweth's own vineyard site comes this tiny-production white, thickly textured in caramelized apple and pear with an oaky imprint at first. Dense and intense, it takes time to unwind in the glass to show more nuanced aspects of corn mash and clove.",US-California-Chardonnay

"This opens with aromas that recall nail polish remover, dark spice and toast. The palate offers fleshy black cherry, vanilla and a hint of coffee alongside bracing tannins. It finishes on an astringent note.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This is a wine that feels heavy, with rich apricot flavors that lack freshness and balance. It's not a wine for aging, but will go well with cakes or pastries.",Austria-Burgenland-Grüner Veltliner
"The wine is full of juicy acidity along with some attractive spice and light wood flavors. It is still developing and the fruit is too young, so give it until 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Showcasing the richness of 2009 without sacrificing fine structure, this is stylish and concentrated. Dark black fruit accompanies a tight, minerality and a fine shaft of acidity. This single-vineyard offering is worth aging for 2–3 years.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Red berry, baking spice and scorched earth aromas waft from the glass of this straightforward red. The easygoing palate offers red berry, cinnamon and a gamey note alongside smooth but rather fleeting tannins. It's at its ideal drinking window so drink now.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Elegant and almost ethereal, this wine is tantalizing and irresistible.

Crisp pears and apples abound in this light-bodied dry Riesling. It's delicate in concentration but pleasantly lemony. The wine finishes briskly but freshly.,US-New York-Riesling
"Right from the beginning, this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend oozes old-school Chilean calling cards: The nose is full of eucalyptus and herbal berry aromas along with tobacco and spicy berry scents. A tannic, heavy palate is hard and grinding, while baked flavors of black fruits come with a reprise of herbaceous character. Drink through 2022.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Red Blend
"Strongly mineral in character, this is a crisp, tight wine that is still young, bright with acidity and citrus flavors. The touches of wood are just right and give an extra dimension to this fruity wine. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Though labeled as Merlot, this smells more like Syrah which makes up 20% of the blend, with aromas of blue and purple fruit along with whiffs of smoked meat and dried herb. The fruit flavors are sweet and plump, backed by soft, luxurious tannins. It's enjoyable but doesn't seem varietally correct.",US-Washington-Merlot

"A new proprietary blend comprised of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, this fruit-forward wine has a lot to like, blessed by soft layers of crème de cassis and a layering of nutmeg. Mouthfillingly juicy, with good length, it offers structure and approachability at a fair price.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The nose of this juicy wine conjures plum and raisin cake, and the palate follows with explosive red cherry and clove and cinnamon seasonings. Big and brawny, it's also softly textured and layered, winning one over in its head-on hedonism.",US-California-Zinfandel

"More subtle at first than the 2010 River Turn, Stony Terrace, another of Black Kite's yearly single-block designates, is earthy, savory and dense.

Well integrated and structured, it's another fine choice for the table and for cellaring another 5–7 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"This wine has weight, richness and an intense texture and structure that brings tannins and a firm background to the generous yellow fruits, ripe apples and crisp green plums. The wine is still very young, needing several years. Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A restrained and powdery nose of yellow plum and ripe red apple hints at the ripeness, which is fully expressed on the broad palate. The mineral length is promising. Still tight, the wine needs time to come into its full, aromatic own. Drink from 2016.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner

"An awesome Cabernet, as deep and dramatic as they come. It shows the incredibly concentrated blackberry and cassis fruit of Howell Mountain, along with firm tannins.

This needs time, and will begin to mellow by 2018 and glide through its changes for many years beyond.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Cabernet hardly gets richer or riper than this. The wine offers a huge blast of ripe and concentrated blackberries, cherries, cassis and mocha. The tannins are dense, yet soft and rich, while the acidity is just strong enough to support the structure. What a beauty. Lovely to drink now, and will develop over the next 10-plus years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"It's been a while since Torres Chile has made a Chardonnay this good. Minerally and toasty is the best way to describe this structured white. Good acidity keeps it upright, while plenty of barrel, cinnamon, apple and lemon character give it a Burgundian leaning. This is woody, racy and very lively now. Drink in 2014–15.",Chile-Limarí Valley-Chardonnay
"More powerful and potent than the '04, this simply has more juice, more depth, more power and more detail than any previous Sheridan wine. The fruit is exceptional—dense black cherry and cassis, with a sense of compact layering that promises great aging potential. This was 30 months in oak but does not seem oaky in any way. It already has the balance, the polish and the length to justify long-term cellaring. Tannins are ripe and supple, bringing in hints of dried herb and black olive.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is an underripe stench bomb with pyrazines coming at you from every direction. The nose is like a bowl of cactus and nettle, while the palate is harsh. Flavors of bitter pithy grapefruit show all that can go wrong with this variety.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"Heavy licorice bombards the nose on this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc, 14% Merlot, 8% Merlot and 8% Petit Verdot, but there is plenty of cassis, fudge, brandy and mint to add complexity. Solid acid and firm tannins grab the palate's attention immediately, allowing blackberry, dried herbs and a rocky minerality to converge cleanly.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Part of the Thienot Champagne group, Canard-Dûchene is only now getting distribution in this country. This top Blanc de Blancs is rich, full-bodied with some softness, but also retaining a good mineral, tight texture.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"This mineral-driven and white-currant-flavored wine shows as much texture as fruitiness. In the future, it will show ripe yellow and pear notes, so age for a year.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Rich but not overly tropical on the nose, this bottling shows buttered nectarine and a touch of honeydew on the nose. The palate is expertly wound up, with bright tangerine, ripe melon and creamy cherimoya, all reined in by a wet cement-like texture.",US-California-Viognier
"Aromas suggest leafy underbrush, oak, vanilla, espresso and ripe berry. The firm palate delivers dried blackcurrant, cranberry, baking spice and toasted oak alongside rather raspy, drying tannins.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"There is a light suggestion of barely ripe strawberry and strawberry leaf, followed by flavors that are more tomatoey than grapy.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Rooty and sweet smelling, with tobacco, burnt brown sugar and raisin aromas. The palate is thick, stacked and jammy, with raisin, tobacco and candied prune and cherry flavors. Very tasty and sweet but a little flat and old.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"The Loner title seems to refer to an absence of oak, although it's not entirely unoaked. The wine spent time in what the winemaker calls “seasoned barriques” that lent no overt oak influence, but let the wine breathe and mellow. Marked by intense lemon, lime and mineral flavors, this bone-dry wine is elegant and eccentric.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Intense and crisp, this wine with its herbal and gooseberry flavors is rich and full bodied. Spicy, with a mineral texture and youthful acidity, the wine is complex and will need to age another few months. Drink from late 2018.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of toasted oak, mint, vanilla and dried berry lead the nose and continue to the palate along with coffee and anise notes. It's rather austere and lacks fruit richness.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"This Riesling has a zingy but complex character, starting with the pear, lemon and vanilla on the nose and the honey, apricot and lemon on the palate. It's elegant but easy drinking, and a great accompaniment to richer ethnic cuisine.",US-New York-Riesling
"Pinots from this AVA have a bit of an herbal edge which, in good hands, can help to define and frame the cool climate fruit flavors. Here is a mix of plum and wild berry, the purple fruit set against balancing tannins that carry that hint of earth and heather.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Pozzan turns his attention to Zinfandel, with good results. The wine shows crisp acidity, rich tannins and brambly flavors of blackberries, cherries, milk chocolate, pepper, cloves and vanilla. So ripe, it tastes sweet, but this Zin is fundamentally dry.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This is a fresh while also rich wine. Yellow fruits are laced with appealing acidity and a crisp lemon zest texture. Lively, fruity and mineral, it is ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This wine opens with forest fruit, chopped herb and fresh almond-blossom notes. The finish feels full and silky.",Italy-Tuscany-Rosato
"Hints of smoke and vanilla add complexity to notes of dried cherry and autumn leaves in this earthy, umami-rich Pinot Noir. Aged three years in barrel, this late-release wine is silken and rich on the palate with just a flurry of tannins on the finish.",US-New York-Pinot Noir
"Pretty, floral and sweet aromas of blue flower and forest floor are doled out in a very controlled and feminine manner. The wine is elegant and refined and shares many of the same characteristics that you would find in a top-rated Pinot Noir.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"Dark in color, deep in aroma, quietly intense in flavor and so mouthcoating in texture—this Cabernet demands to be noticed. Yet all of those bold elements are wrapped in a tightly woven and softly finished texture. The flavors are like dark chocolate and ripe blackberries, the mouthfeel is fine and it's not overly tannic or too full-bodied.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Viscous and heavy, this 100% Zinfandel made in a Port-like style is intense and chocolaty, a concentrated form of blackberry and blueberry that shows full-bodied richness.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A simple, sweet wine, with sugary cherry, chocolate and anise flavors. There's a curious, disagreeable charred taste, like a cigarette butt.",US-California-Mourvèdre
"Perfumed red berry, blue flower, baking spice and balsamic aromas open this round, full-bodied red. The accessible palate offers wild cherry, crushed plum and cinnamon alongside soft tannins. Drink through 2016.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"More full-bodied than the past couple of vintages, the 2012 Estate bottling features fruit flavors of rhubarb and cranberry, a light sprinkling of peppery herb, and drying tannins, with a bit of clay in the aftertaste.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This Avidagos vineyard in the Corgo River Valley is one of the oldest in the Douro. The wine, from a parcel of old vines, is hugely powerful and dense. With its dark tannins, concentrated black fruits, it could be too much. Somehow it pulls back leaving a very rich wine but also one that has structure and final freshness. The wine needs to age and should not be drunk before 2020.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Another wonderfully complex wine from this single vineyard on the Napa side of the A.V.A. It's a tight, young wine, showing lime, apricot and mineral flavors. A sunburst of acidity marks the clean, dry finish. Oak and lees play supporting roles. It's likely this wine will improve over the long haul.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A blend of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, this presents lovely fragrances of blue flower, incense and tilled soil. On the palate, velvety tannins provide a backbone for juicy blackberry, black cherry and Asian spice. Soft and elegant, this is ready to be enjoyed. Drink through 2017.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Valdivieso's nonvintage mystery blend is always one of Chile's most curious wines, and #16 happens to be superb. An opening of rich black-cherry aromas tips towards spice cake with raisins. A lush, saturated palate holds delicious flavors of chocolaty black fruits, while on the finish a dark smokiness takes over. Drink now–2023.",Chile-Central Valley-Red Blend
"This is a bright and fruity wine that is also rich. Yellow fruits are accompanied by fresh, textured citrus and given a crisp aftertaste by the lively acidity. Drink now.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"A light straw color, bright fruit aromas and a dot of sweetness paint the picture of an easy-drinking refresher. The bracing grapefruit and green apple aromas and flavors are attractive and pleasurable. It's medium-bodied, crisp in balance and slightly soft on the finish.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of cocoa, milk chocolate, spice and red berries are followed by tart luscious red-cherry and chocolate flavors. It shows a pleasing sense of balance.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Sweet and candied, with pie-filling cherry and blackberry flavors. Tastes almost like a dessert wine or inexpensive Port.",US-California-Merlot
"Soft, plush and modern, this is a superstar Brunello with all the qualities we love in this gorgeous category of wine. Made from organically farmed fruit, it offers amazing intensity and determination with aromas of spice, blackberry and currants. The texture is smooth and silky and the tannins offer a solid backbone.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"It's bit harsh in texture and is minty, with wintergreen and pepper flavors that nudge into cherries and mocha. Good for barbecue and cheese plates.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Tart strawberry and fizzing, lemony brightness give verve and a real refreshment factor to this light-bodied, frothy little rosé. There is welcome dryness to the clean, taut flavors. Overall this is light-hearted, easy-drinking fun.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"A luxurious, tempting oak perfume continues through the flavors of this richly textured, spicy wine. Aromas are toasted and smoky while the flavors are ripe blackberries and dark chocolate.",US-California-Tempranillo
"This wine offers aromas of herbs, black cherry and spice, showing a bit of heat. The dark-fruit flavors have good intensity, with dry, astringent tannins backing them up.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"At the top of the Rancho Zabaco hierarchy are the Zinfandels from the company's Chiotti and Stefani vineyards. Unfortunately there will be no Stefani in 2000, but the Chiotti is very good. It's very young, and takes a bit of coaxing to tease out aromas of toast, dried spices and blackberries before flowing smoothly across the palate in a wave of briary fruit. Finishes with firm acidity and a bit of black pepper. Drink now.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Delicate tones of crushed stone and dried apricot entice on the nose of this silken yet steely dry wine. Despite its moderate alcohol, there's a robustness on the palate marked by concentrated white peach and apricot flavors. That steely precision rings through the finish though, bolstered by a nervy streak of lemon and lime acidity.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"This is a soft wine with juicy acidity, a creamy texture and a touch of crisp citrus at the end.",France-France Other-Chardonnay
"Any doubts that Portugal's Alentejo region can rival many big New World wines would be dispelled by this extravagant wine. With its intense fruit, sweet tannins, figs, coffee and spice flavors, it packs a serious punch of flavor. For drinking now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Subtle yeast spice plays on the nose of this light-bodied wine and gains far more currency on the peppery, spicy palate. Fruit comes in the form of slender, lemony citrus but the peppery spice fizzes on beneath the surface creating an immensely lively and refreshing wine with real zip.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"Like many Roero wines this vintage, the winning key here is a balance between ripe fruit aromas and a tightly structured consistency. The wine's power and body is rendered more approachable thanks to careful oak softness.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Red berry and herbal aromas are firm and focused on the nose. A snappy palate deals savory and fruity flavors of red berry, olive and mint. Firm tannins and driving acidity push the finish a bit further.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"French oak, coconut and spice aromas follow through to the lean palate, where they're joined by sour cherry and vanilla flavors. Grainy, fleeting tannins give it an abrupt finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This wine is principally Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with the balance other Bordeaux varieties. Aromas of clove, sweet plum, vanilla and tire rubber lead to sweet, palate-coating blueberry and smoke flavors that linger.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Produced from 30-year-old vines, this 55% Cabernet Sauvignon wine is firm with tannins as well as black-currant fruit. It is balanced with the potential to become a fruity wine with a soft texture. The acidity will keep it crisp and on point. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A lengthy, plush and full-bodied expression of the variety, this wine is sourced from the producer's estate, Stanly Ranch, as well as Hyde and Poe vineyards. Salty caramel and toffee are complemented by bright orange and lemon accents. It's well balanced and attractive now.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Another terrific Signature Cabernet from Chappellet. This has primary blackberry and cherry-jam flavors, with an additional note of toasty oak. The tannins and acids are excellent, lending structure to the richness. The result is a wonderfully-complex Napa Cabernet that should develop over the next six years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"From the home of Touriga Nacional, this is a seriously structured wine. Packed with tannins as well as initially austere fruit, it is still young. It will develop its perfumed black fruits and acidity as it ages to fill out the dense texture. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Dão-Touriga Nacional
"This aged Nero d'Avola delivers sophisticated tones of cherry liqueur, asphalt, resin, coffee bean, dried prunes and plums. The wine delivers personality and charm with a silky, elegant feel in the mouth. The integrity of fruit probably won't last much longer, so don't wait long to drink it.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"This is an attractive, relatively light Sauternes. It has a fine botrytis character that's already well integrated with the orange peel and honey flavors. Not for aging; ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
Struck flint and tomato stalk on the nose lead into a medium-bodied wine with strong citrus overtones. White grapefruit and green leafy notes linger on the dry finish.,New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a good, traditional-style wine with aromas like sage and plums. Flavors are fruity but accented by herbs, with a texture that is mild in tannins and relatively soft.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Tender, friendly hints of juicy pear beckon. The palate follows with more oomph and lots of lemon freshness. There is a lovely textural element to the crisp midpalate and edges of peppery herbs everywhere that haunt you long after the lip-smacking finish.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
Miso and yeast are met by lemon zest and pear peel. The palate is streamlined and slender and homes in on a central vein of beautiful grass and herb-scented freshness. This literally dances on and off the palate and leaves you with wonder that such lightness can have so much flavor.,Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"The Del Rio vineyard, in southern Oregon's Rogue Valley AVA, has pioneered the cultivation of Syrah in that part of the Northwest. As the vines acquire some age, they are coming into focus, and the rough tannins seem to be more in balance with the fruit. These wines are somewhat similar in style to the Syrahs from the Okanagan valley of Canada, and they offer an earthy mix of flavor that puts the fruit under earth, soy, coffee and smoke. Tannins in this Tyrus Evan are beautifully managed, with the edges sanded down, and the wine has a lovely, lingering presence on the palate.",US-Oregon-Syrah
"Rusty in color, with a mildly mulchy, leafy nose that's also slightly floral and smells of orange peel. Zesty in the mouth, with a lean profile and tart flavors of red cherry, plum and herbs.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A Viognier vibrant in pear with a suggestion of coconut flake that's medium in weight and not overly wrought, Sobon's version is a good value at $16, fine, simple and fragrant in melon and orange rind, a taste of oak on the finish.",US-California-Viognier
"Aromas of cured meat, stewed fruit and toasted oak lead the nose. On the ripe palate, notes of powdered sage, vanilla and oak spices accent fleshy black plum. Bracing tannins provide the framework, but drink soon to capture the fruit richness.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"From a cooler section of the Napa Valley, this Chardonnay offers simple, crisp and creamy aromas and flavors of apple and pear, toasty oak and vanilla.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This bottling, which is balanced by 16% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot, rides the savory edge of the grape, with aromas of underbrush and dried herbs giving depth to the black-olive and black-currant aromas. The palate offers a mix of red and darker fruits, including cranberry, plum and blackberry, with touches of thyme and anise.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Soft and direct. Tastes like a liquid granola bar, with melted flavors of raspberries, cocoa, roasted almonds, vanilla, cinnamon and brown sugar. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Dry and crisp, with a fine, clean minerality, this Chardonnay is dominated by the vanilla and toast of oak. The underlying wine shows pineapple, Asian pear and lime flavors. It's elegant, but a little thin.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Nice and welcoming on the nose, with melon, citrus and other punchbowl aromas. The palate is graced with fine acidity, which amplifies the wine's standard green apple and lime flavors. Clean and showing no glaring issues. Textbook everyday Chilean SB; we could drink this stuff forever.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"A little scouring, but delicious and complex, this has appealing flavors of yeast, lemons, limes and pears. Dry and yeasty, it feels very elegant on the palate.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"A Merlot-dominated wine, structured with stalky black currant fruits, solid tannins and attractive spiciness. With its firm, serious character, it does need to age a few years. Drink from 2015.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Balanced and ripe, this is a rich wine. Its tannins and dark chocolate and wood flavors are deliciously balanced by ripe black fruit. It's concentrated and dense and will age well. Drink from 2021.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Whiffs of smoke and crushed stone lend a mineral edge to this dry, full-bodied Riesling. The palate is fairly straightforward, but crisp and bright, with grapefruit acidity and a swathe of savory herbs that would match well with herb-accented Thai and Vietnamese cuisine.",Germany-Pfalz-Riesling
"This is a finely balanced, rich wine. Bringing together Antão Vaz, Arinto and Roupeiro, the wine is packed with white fruits and a citrus twist. It has a crisp edge and bright acidity although with an underlying richness that makes the wine ideal for spicy foods. Drink now.",Portugal-Alentejo-Portuguese White
"Aromatic herb, Spanish broom, ripe pear and toasted almond notes take center stage. The almond impression carries over to the firmly structured palate, adding interest to citrus zest and yellow apple flavors.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Friulano
"A fresh, off-dry wine with a year's aging is unusual for a Vinho Verde in this style. The result is that although the wine has lost some of its startling fruit and acidity, it has smoothed out, giving more room for the apple flavors. Drink now.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White
"There are still some rough edges here: hints of volatility, burnt wood notes and unintegrated barrel flavors. But there is substantial red fruit at the core, and it's got plenty of punch and power to stand up to a smoky barbequed meal.",US-Oregon-Tempranillo
"Jadot's take on Burgundy Chardonnay is fruity and creamy. Juicy, intense acidity comes from the crisp apple and white peach fruits. A touch of wood aging softens the fruit and broadens the character of the wine. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Made in smaller amounts than its sister label, Starmont, this wine has more complexity and layering of flavors and textures. It opens juicy and exuberant, almost brawny, in black cherry and berry. Oak, currant and clove provide a spicy flair midway through and on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Lifted honeysuckle and jasmine perfume abound throughout this textbook Mosel Kabinett. Sun-kissed apricots and peaches burst on the palate, yet maintain a graphite edge of minerality and acidity. It's a crystalline fruity wine that's irresistible now for its youthful exuberance.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Despite coming from a universally hailed vintage, this generic Bordeaux is still weedy, herbal and lean. But it also has decent cassis and cherry fruit, some tasty vanilla and cinnamon notes from oak aging, and a tart, dry finish. It's light, but it hasn't been dumbed down for the mass market.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Campogiovanni is a rich, inky expression of Sangiovese Grosso with beautiful personality and length. The mouthfeel is still young and raw but the aromas already show deep evolution and harmony. You'll recognize tones of red cherry, root beer, mesquite and Indian spice.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Typical pepper and spice flavors mark this wine as a classic, fresh, ready-to-drink Grüner. It's all about bright acidity and hints of minerality.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"A broad as well as crisp wine that has great fresh, beautifully polished ripe pear fruit, lightly nutty in character.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
Giall'Oro demonstrates that Prosecco Superiore does indeed show individual traits linked to the special territory that characterizes this corner of northern Italy. The wine is soft and creamy with pretty endnotes of ripe peach and melon.,Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Cocoa, vanilla, and cherry aromas are followed by abundant black-cherry flavors supported by grainy slightly astringent tannins. It needs some time to settle in.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"There is an interesting floral component—white blossoms—coming through in the nose, and sailing along on top of flavors of buttered nuts. A somewhat oily mouthfeel is lifted by moderate acids, and the overall length and follow-through make this one of the better vintages of this affordably priced wine.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Heady aromas of honeysuckle, white peach and green apple carry through to the vibrant palate along with lemon zest. It boasts crisp acidity and a lively perlage that lead to a dry refreshing close.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"For now, funky yeast dominates the nose. The palate, however, abounds with friendly yellow Mirabelle plum and mandarin notes, all pulled into beautiful focus by lemon freshness. There is concentration and drive, energy and verve. This is beautiful, impressive and yet friendly and gentle. Lovely balance and aromatic length.",Austria-Kremstal-Riesling
"This rich wine still shows its wood-aging character. It has firm tannins, dark fruit and concentration. From vineyards in the Douro Superior, this wine should be drunk from 2018.",Portugal-Douro-Touriga Nacional
"Ripe black-plum and black-cherry aromas lead the nose. This is full in body, with comfortable tannins. Blackberry and baked blueberry flavors end with chocolaty, herbal notes and a coating of blackened toast.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Merlot
"Intense, spicy and loaded with grapefruit, pineapple and citrus, this has a unique intensity and power. If you distill Washington Riesling down to its essential fruit/sugar/acid components, this expresses it beautifully. At just 9.8% alcohol, it's a definite Kabinett style, with so much acid that the 2% sugar does not signify.",US-Washington-Riesling
"A bit thin on the nose, this has buttery apple juice aromas. The acidity is a bit off, both tart and mixed with vanilla creaminess, and the flavors are slight with apple candy and tart lemon.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a beautifully pure wine with good acidity and a very crisp texture. It's all about fresh citrus while keeping a place for the tight, cool character of this vineyard. The end shows grapefruit and steeliness in equal combination. Drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This opens with floral aromas of violet, iris and a whiff of sunbaked earth. The straightforward palate offers wild black cherry and a hint of dark spice alongside polished tannins. Enjoy through 2018.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"A youthful and appealing wine with notes of orange peel, citrus and crushed flowers. The palate brings abundant stone fruit flavors that taper off toward the finish.",Canada-Ontario-Riesling
"Full and ripe, this wine has the ease of the 2000 vintage but has integrated textured acidity and some powerful green and white fruit flavors. There is an attractive yeast element to add complexity.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Gold shows unexpected sophistication for the otherwise overtly bold and gregarious Sagrantino grape. Those prickly tannins you recognize from the variety are wrapped by layers of spice, cured meat and dried berry fruit.",Italy-Central Italy-Sagrantino
"Dried fruit, chopped herbs, dusty mineral, sweet apple and cinnamon spice characterize this fragrant wine from Mount Etna. It's less intense in the mouth but would make a good pairing to wild mushrooms or beef carpaccio.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"The wine is impressive and packed with dense dark fruits. It comes from the showpiece estate of Madiran that was created by the iconic producer of the region, Alain Brumont. If this wine wasn't quite so intense, so overpowering and so alcoholic, it would be very great indeed. As it is, it will surely age and should not be drunk until 2020.",France-Southwest France-Tannat-Cabernet
"Vibrant and easygoing, this opens with aromas that recall woodland berry, violet and moist soil. The bright, simple palate offers tart sour cherry and a hint of white pepper alongside zesty acidity.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"The bouquet offers intensity and character, with subtle accents of crème de cassis and toasted almond.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"From a Lovall Valley location, this light white is intense in pear and peach, with a nuttiness to the strong, viscous foundation of oak. It finishes crisply like a twist of lime.",US-California-Pinot Grigio

"This is a good Zinfandel with some special qualities. It's full-bodied and very ripe, with berry-cherry flavors that have a baked, pie-filling warmth, and additional layers of olive tapenade and salted, dried beef. The finish includes Zin's savory wealth of peppery spices.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Impressive dark purple in color, this powerful vin carries lots of toasted-oak aromas: menthol and cedar in particular. There's some promising dark fruit underneath it all that should emerge in a couple years' time. Less exciting than this winery's 1996, which leads to the question: could the creation of a luxury cuvée have had an effect on the quality of this wine?",France-Southwest France-Red Blend
"From the winery's own Westside Road vineyard, formerly called Litton, comes this grandiose, if immature, Pinot Noir. In its youth it's all about primary, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit. On the edges are fine acidity, smooth tannins and a perfect appliqué of oak. Shows the hallmarks of this great, emerging vineyard, but needs serious time to come around. Try after 2015.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This geeky bottling with 21 days of skin contact shouldn't be confused with the fresh zest expected in a pink wine. Aromas of are similar to an Old Fashioned cocktail, with macerated Maraschino cherries, pulverized orange peels and a touch of smoky bourbon. There's a burst of acidity once sipped, then the wine emerges toward a bitter grip, with more dried cherry and orange peel flavors.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"Aromas of charcoal and flavors of barbecue sauce make it pretty clear what to eat when drinking this bold, spicy and assertive wine. Moderate tannins give just enough texture to support this medium-bodied wine.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sassy right off the bat, with feline aromas and juniper. Feels wet, bouncy and soda-like, with a mix of prickly green-fruit flavors and sweetness. There's more of the same on the finish; it's briny and melony sweet.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"Surprisingly tropical, with concentrated notes of pineapple and guava, this dry, fruity Silvaner is elegantly structured, with zesty lime acidity. It's brisk and delicate on the palate, making it an excellent choice to pair with salads or vegetarian entrees.",Germany-Franken-Silvaner
"Both sour and black cherry join with blackberry on this wine from Laetitia. It delivers a rich, full mouth, with a good tannic grip and lasting finish—perhaps in part due to the inclusion of stems in the fermentation process. Flavors approach the yellow-red blend of Mexican taco spices, equally savory and spicy.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Made in a crisp, dry style, this is leaner than many other New Zealand Pinot Gris, marked by its taut texture and subtle notes of almond skin, barely ripe melon and tart citrus. It makes for a refreshing sipper, or a fine foil to delicate fish dishes.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Gris
"This is a soft Champagne—more like a wine with bubbles than a crisp apéritif. With its relatively high dosage and ripe red fruit, it's rich up front, cleaning up with acidity on the finish. Keep for a few more months and drink from 2018.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This wine has concentration, dark tannins and powerful fruits. A smoky character is balanced by the black-plum flavors. The wine will develop slowly, so wait until 2022.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a structured wine, with a dry character, ripe fruit and firm acidity. It has a dry core that needs more aging to bring out its potential richness.",Austria-Thermenregion-St. Laurent
"Acidic on the nose, like a cider, this late-harvest wine made from 100% Sauvignon Blanc retains 130 g/L residual sugar, and is rounded and plush. Appropriately sweet, it is completely balanced, tasting purely of baked pear, finding a hint of nutmeg on the lengthy finish.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This blend of 37% Grenache, 37% Syrah and 26% Mourvèdre is brooding, with its char, smoke, cranberry, dark plum and woodspice aromas. On the palate, silky black cherry flavors are accented with barrel-derived notes, striking a lovely balance.",US-Washington-G-S-M
"An earthy funk and puckeringly dry tannins mark this wine, which remains dry on the palate from start to finish, characterized along the way in leather and black pepper.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This medium- to full-bodied Pinot Noir has strong savory overtones. Leather and mushroom notes take charge early on and never let up, dominating the modest plum fruit and lingering on the finish. Drink up.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"This is tight, toasty and focused upon opening, with highlights of green olive and a core of mixed tree fruits. Excellent concentration, vivid acidity and a suggestion of wet rock contribute to a well-balanced wine with structure and length. The framing here is just right, with 30% new oak adding subtle threads of light wood flavors. Decant or cellar till 2020 before drinking.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"A blend of near-equal parts Cabernet Franc, Syrah and Merlot topped off with a pinch of Petit Verdot, this wine exhibits aromas of barrel spices, dried herbs and cherry, showing whiffs of volatility. The flavors are soft and pure, lingering on the finish.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"There's a marked tropical richness (think guava and melon) here compared to the producer's other 2015 ausleses. Plump and plush despite it's dainty alcoholic footprint, it lingers lusciously while remaining pert with acidity. Brilliantly balanced and irresistibly sweet, it can be enjoyed now through 2040.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Vionta aims for the racy, lively style of Albariño, and for the most part it nails it. Aromas of peach and nectarine are youthful and pure, while the flavors of apple, peach and lime are pleasant. Not over the top but instead it achieves balance and ease. Imported by Freixenet, USA.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"From one of the most acclaimed up-and-coming wineries in Italy, this wine delivers pure Sangiovese nuances of red fruit, blue flower and wet earth. It shows beautiful density and richness, and the finish offers loads of blackberry flavor.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Superb, opulent, just wonderful. Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Fantastically ripe and rich in black cherries, currants, sandalwood and spices, with a grounding streak of herbs. Beyond the flavors is the near-perfect structure, marked by smooth, complex tannins. Finishes sweet but completely dry, the paradox of a great wine. Drink now–2015.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Pristine white grapefruit and pear are accented by hints of fennel and saffron in this light-bodied, dry Pinot Gris. Sunny lemony acidity lends a soft, yielding feel to the palate.",US-New York-Pinot Gris

"This Chardonnay is mostly about oak. It's strong in buttered toast and butterscotch flavors, with suggestions of pineapples, green apples and pears. Shows good acidity, but is just too oaky to earn a higher score.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Dry, bold and intensely mineral, this powerful Riesling is lifted by whiffs of lemongrass and mint, along with a shining streak of lemon acidity. It finishes with a bristle of lime zest astringency and a hint of white flower.",Germany-Nahe-Riesling
"Juicy strawberry and raspberry fruits form the base of an aromatic profile that also picks up some sagebrush and dried cake frosting. Though lighter in body, the flavors emerge continually on the palate, from ripe berries to tomato stew to cola to mint. Serve with roasted chicken or turkey or even a rich pasta.  Bargetto has been making wine since 1933.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Stocky plum and smashed-berry aromas offer notes of garrigue and wild animal. As for mouthfeel, this Syrah is layered, chewy and pulpy, with power in reserve.

"fruits touched with caramel and soft tannin. It's well balanced, with fruit and acidity integrating richly on the finish. It's a fine summer wine but also good for Thanksgiving turkey.",France-Provence-Rosé
"From an older vintage, this edition of Libatio shows some tertiary aromas of licorice and mineral backed by chocolate fudge and dusty hazelnut. Drink now.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Heavily charred aromas throw a shadow over roasted, stalky red-berry notes. This feels tight, choppy and drawing, with no give to the palate. Roasted, salty plum and berry flavors end with a final round of hard, pounding tannins.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Tempranillo

"With an addition of 3% Petit Verdot, this wine sources from Andy Beckstoffer's Missouri Hopper Vineyard in Oakville and Benessere in St. Helena. It impresses in brown sugar and berry pie, the underlying foundation succulently fruity as savory touches of clove and pencil shavings begin to show amidst the firm tannin.",US-California-Merlot
"Earthy, leathery aromas of baked red fruits fit the classic style. This is full on the palate but not heavy, with cola, molasses, coffee and heady raspberry and plum flavors. A warm finish with fine tannins and ripe flavors of chocolate, lightly baked black fruits and vanilla. Drink 2015–2025.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Sea salt and buttered popcorn hit the nose first on this wine by Felipe Hernandez, who rose through his storied career from a field hand to winemaker. Next comes a leaner sense of chalk and Key lime rind. The palate shows buttered apple richness alongside lime and lemon acidity throughout the sip, with a touch of baking soda and more salt on the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Aromas of cocoa, cassis and marshmallow are sweet and attractive, while the palate feels just right and tastes of cassis, plum, caramel and pepper. While it is powerful, it's not a runaway tank. Thus expect a sly finish that's toasty, dark and polite. Drink now and over the next couple of years. Very good Cab from one of Chile's top producers.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A little roasted and leafy smelling, which is typical for base-level Chilean Merlot. The palate is sweet almost to the brink of being candied, with plum and chocolate flavors running the show.

"Spring Mountain Cabs typically are hard in youth but not this one, to which all the techniques of early drinkability seem to have been applied. The tannins are here, bigtime, but so finely grained you can drink the wine tonight.

Drink now through 2014.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"With hints of barnyard and graphite accenting lush notes of blackberries, cassis and ceder, this distinctly Old World-style Cabernet is fascinatingly complex, yet undeniably simple in style. It's austere on the palate with layers of fine, yet penetrating tannins and a finish that's just a tad astringent.",US-New York-Cabernet Sauvignon

"A simple Chard, with vanilla, buttered popcorn and pineapple jam flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay

Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

Drink 2020–2027.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Mature winter apple, oatmeal and the intricate aromas of dark pine honey give a complex, rich nose to this crémant. The honeyed notes become more pronounced with air and create a thrilling counterpoint to the streak of lemony freshness that pervades the palate. The mousse is integrated, fine and soft while the autolysis lends layers of brioche, oatmeal, earth and yeast. It has backbone, character and a beautifully long finish.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend

With medium body, a velvety texture and flavor complexity, this is the complete Pinot package.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Here's one of Testarossa's more forward Pinots from the 2011 vintage, but that appeal is deceptive. It's rich and ripe in raspberry, strawberry and cola flavors, with an apparent sweetness that belies the dry finish. The acidity is adequate, giving it a tart softness. Yet the parts have not come together. Give it until 2017 and see what happens.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Firm with dark tannins, this is a structured wine. It is still reticent, likely to take several more years to show its fruit. It is dense with the black-plum fruit behind the firm tannins.

"Big tannins support the layers of extracted, concentrated fruit that leans red into cherry, cassis and currant. Char and vanilla speak for the oak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"A wine of contradictions, this attempts to merge ripe elements, like fig, nectarine and melon, with taut notes of citrus and hints of garden peas. It's medium bodied, with a crisp, pleasant finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Huge in structure and monolithic in flavor, this young, rough-cut wine will need until at least 2020 to show its best stuff. This variety is known for aging well, so it's not much of a gamble.

"The dryness and tannins of this wine are on the outside. Inside it has plenty of juicy fruit, sweet acidity and black plum flavors. Put the two together and this ripe wine offers plenty of potential. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Beautiful in peach color, this blends 73% Chardonnay and 27% Pinot Noir. Dry and crisp, it tangles together vibrant flavors of grapefruit, tangerine and cherry, as aromas of rose petal whisper by. A stony mineral component adds complexity and invitation to the texture.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"This bright Moscato d'Asti opens with full, generous tones of peach, honey, acacia blossom, jasmine and freshly peeled tangerine skin. The rich and foamy mouthfeel would pair with soft cheese on dry rye crackers.",Italy-Piedmont-Moscato
"Dark in color, this accessible wine is deliciously layered and focused, offering a core of golden pear, Gravenstein apple and nutmeg, with a bright laser beam of acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This vineyard blend shows the riper, oakier side of a Santa Rita Hills Pinot Noir. Rich, fruity and direct, it has luscious raspberry, strawberry and oak flavors, with a touch of sautéed mushrooms and heirloom tomatoes. Drink over the next few years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Small additions of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon result in an elegant blend with measured fruit intensity and lasting impressions of blue flowers, licorice and almond paste. You can really taste the delicate Sangiovese component.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Freshly cut Granny Smith vies with Golden Delicious on the fruit-driven nose and palate. The palate has a tart edge but the flavors are fresh, citric and clean—autolysis is barely perceptible while the fizz is rather frothy yet easily dissipates. If you don't like aggressive mousse, this is a softer choice.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"Crisp green pear and a razor-thin sharpness cut into more lush kiwi and honeysuckle notes on the nose of this bottling. A steely line of Key lime slices through the white peach flavors once sipped, and the palate cleans up with a tense, chalky grip.",US-California-Grenache Blanc
"Deep gold in color. Complex nose, very earthy, savory, minerally aromas showing some evolution. Rich, viscous and broad across the palate with a strong savory, almost vegetal palette of flavors, some spice. Slightly lacking in freshness and fruit. Full-bodied with a warm, round finish.",France-Alsace-Muscat
"A soft, somewhat simple wine, with earthy flavors of cherries, herbs and oak. Easy to drink with everyday fare.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Liberally oaked, thus there's sawdust and spice to accent the berry fruit aromas. Tannic and full-bodied, and tasting of roasted black fruits with a generous sprinkling of baking spices. Chunky, tannic and arguably a little saucy/soupy on the finish. Best if you like big, roasted, chubby wines.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Based in the Aube in southern Champagne, Fluteau's vineyards are in the Seine valley. This crisp, tight and dry wine is balanced although still young. Textured crisp apple and lemon flavors have a taut, nervy character. It needs to age for a few more months, so drink from 2016.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"A touch raw and rough on the bouquet, with rubbery berry aromas and earth notes that suggest compost. The palate is thick but shows angular tannins, while the flavors are oaky and creamy, with basic berry and plum intermixed.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"The smoky, peppery aromas and smoky, pomegranate flavors may be atypical, but the wine is well-balanced and enjoyable to drink.",US-California-Tempranillo
"A healthy dose of Petite Sirah toughens this Zin, sourced from a benchland vineyard in the heart of the Dry Creek Valley. The wine opens with aromas of cinnamon bark and cranberry, a tugging mushroomy element standing by. Subtle notes of black pepper come into play on the finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"90-92 Structured, ripe wine, full of tight botrytis character and acidity. The wine is spicy, complex, rich.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Starts out crusty and dark, with earth, leather and other savory aromas. The palate is clacky and tannic, with roasted berry, leather and slightly burnt and bitter oak accents. Finishes peppery, with drying hardness and a pinch of leafy herbalness.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Produced from selected parcels of fruit in top vintages, this is the flagship wine from this Jorgensen family estate. Aragonez and Syrah dominate this ripe still-young wine. It is rich and concentrated with powerful tannins and layers of acidity, dark chocolate flavors and generous black-plum flavors. It will certainly age further and this fine wine will be best drunk from 2019.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"This is a full, rich wine that has pears and yellow fruits to contrast a fresh minerality and brisk acidity. As the wine opens, it's increasingly bright and crisp in character. A well balanced wine that's full of fruitiness.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Chalk and the merest touch of honey, a little lanolin and lots of lemon and lime peel: that describes the complex nose of this dry Riesling from the wondrous 2008 vintage. The palate is poised and dry, its lightness accentuated by the rich, stony flavors around its core. Lemon freshness runs throughout. The finish is gloriously long.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Aromas include pear, smoke, flint and citrus peel. The palate has ripe apple, lemon drop, mineral and bitter walnut alongside a note of medicinal herbs.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Friulano
"This wine is soft and on the sweet end of the Brut spectrum. It is packed with red fruits, but its light on the acidity and finishes with a gentle ripe aftertaste. It would be delicious as an apéritif Champagne.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Lemon notes are subdued by earth on the nose but they shine on a rather textured, palate that needs some air to open up. There is concentration at the core and generous freshness that lights up everything. Subtle but totally worthwhile with a clean lemon finish.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Aromatically intriguing, this features notes of crushed green grapes, green apple and botrytis. It's a hair off dry, with nicely balanced acidity and stone fruit flavors. Best as a dinner table companion.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"This delivers enormous aromatic intensity that rises from the glass in a determined and immediate manner. The nose is awash in aromas of ripe fruit, leather, tobacco, exotic spice and black pepper. The soft, chewy mouthfeel is capped by a strong blast of roasted coffee bean.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"A prodigious effort, the 2009 Vieilles Vignes from Grand Veneur includes a whopping 40% Mourvèdre in the blend (there's also 10% Syrah, with the balance being Grenache), which no doubt accounts for its dark flavor profile. This is a full-bodied, lushly textured, expansive wine, with a finish that seems to go on forever. Approachable now, it should age well for 10–12 years at least.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Yes, this wine comes from a village of Chardonnay in the Mâcon region of Burgundy. It's a typical, crisp, freshly green Chardonnay that zings on to the palate. No wood here, just light grapefruit and citrus flavors, rounded with a touch of apple. Screwcap.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"On the bright and crisp side, this is a lively, fresh wine, mingling green fruits with toast and a more opulent richness.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This is dark, with a dominant wood flavor that covers the potentially ripe fruit. It is full of firm tannins, with a flavor of bitter chocolate. It may be that this wine will always have too much dry wood.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This medium-bodied appellation wine is impressive in its combination of crisp red fruit, rhubarb, watermelon and pomegranate flavors alongside a dash of orange citrus. The smooth texture adds to the whole, as does a seasoning of allspice, while the finish is snappy in acidity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Morrison Lane's Sangiovese includes a little Syrah and Carmenère in the blend, giving it a light sprinkling of peppery spice. Tart red fruits fill in the rest.",US-Washington-Sangiovese
"Smells like crushed vitamins, iron and minerals, but no fruit. Weak, funky and sour tasting, and then angular on the finish. There's even some sauerkraut in the mix. Not what we're looking for.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"Huge black-fruit intensity rushes to the nose and gives this wine a sun-drenched, jammy feel that is soft, but not necessarily sweet. In fact, this ripe Primitivo shows balance and a touch of refreshing acidity.",Italy-Southern Italy-Primitivo
"Rusack's basic Pinot, with a county-wide appellation, is a bargain, even though it's not cheap. It shows real class and finesse, with an elegant mouthfeel and brisk acidity highlighting cherry, cranberry, licorice and sandalwood flavors. Drink over the next 2–3 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Kana's Workingman's Red has turned into a southern Rhône style blend of six grapes, the only outlier being a splash of Tempranillo. Toasty, round and easy-drinking, it's a good, all-purpose barbecue red, with a smoky, espresso-scented finish.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"From two vineyards on the eastern side of the valley, including one on Howell Mountain, this small-production wine offers whiffs of leather saddle and black currant around softened tannins and crème-de-cassis-like sweetness, especially on the nose.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Briny, minerally aromas of vitamin dust and lees feed into a yeasty, round, melony palate. Flavors of yellow apple, mango and mustard finish yeasty, soft and briny.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"Gaudium is a radically unique expression of Fiano that might not appeal to everyone but that definitely shows careful craftsmanship and execution. The nose is redolent of crushed clove and exotic spice (aromas you'd almost expect to find in a red wine) closely followed by fresh melon, pear and peach.",Italy-Southern Italy-Fiano
"Driven by vivid blackberry and black cherry flavors, this medium-bodied wine tastes pure, concentrated, and true to the grape variety. It has mild tannins, fresh acidity and an appealing sense of balance.",US-California-Syrah
"Rooty berry and coffee aromas are medicinal. This feels punchy due to stark acidity. Flavors of oaky red plum and currant finish similarly, and while this Rioja isn't bothersome it's raw throughout.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This blend of Tempranillo, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Garnacha is gamy on the nose, with aromas of tomato leaf, compost and cherry-pie filling. The palate is decidedly acidic, while flavors of zesty red fruits like red currant and sour plum come across herbal and a touch weedy.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"Aged in a combination of concrete egg, stainless steel and new French oak, this winning white is a study in peach and apricot—it's incredibly inviting in both taste and aroma. A layer of honey adds succulence without sweetness, as it remains dry and balanced through the mineral-laden finish.",US-California-Riesling
"This is a simple, country-style Pinot Noir, dry and modest in berry fruit. It's not bad, just not particularly interesting. But for the price, it will get you through.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This release comes from the producer's own Durell Vineyard, specifically two blocks consistently used for this wine. Powerful ripeness and showy fruit rise on the nose and palate first, with an explosion of coconut water and burly oak. The wine was given 15 months in French oak, half of it new. Almonds, oranges and lemon rind combine before a dry finish. Drink now through 2021.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend is very rich in chocolate, blackberry and cherry fruit. New French oak adds notes of sweet toast and vanilla.

"This perennial offering from the producer, the longtime proprietor of this fine vineyard, showcases cassis and chocolate in full-bodied, undulating waves of big, brash flavor. Despite the mountain provenance, the tannins are soft and well integrated, never distracting from the ripeness of the fruit.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Structured and elegant, it opens with a fruit fragrance of black plum, wild berries and prune accentuated with hints of leather, tilled soil and spice. The juicy palate delivers wild cherry layered with cinnamon, white pepper and carob alongside big, velvety tannins. Delicious now, it will also develop complexity. Drink now–2022.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Smells baked and hot, tastes harsh and dry, a bitter, astringent wine without charm.",US-California-Merlot
"Very ripe and oaky. Bursts with pineapple pie filling, tapioca, butterscotch and caramel flavors. Could use some complexity and restraint.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A hard, chewy wine, this brings tight flavors of cassis and black olive, plus an herbal edge that veers into bitterness. Chalky acids come up through an attenuated finish.",US-Oregon-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Full of very ripe fruit, this is soft and smooth at the beginning, before showing a firmer structure. It has a plum flavor and ripe acidity. With its superrichness and roundness, this is likely to be ready to drink soon.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Firm, tense and dryly tannic, this is a solid wine, foursquare, its edges a little rough at present. The berry fruits are black, spicy from wood, creating a rich feel. In the end, black currant acidity and freshness finish the wine with a lift.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Chunky, lightly vegetal, green-fruit aromas are authentic for Casablanca SB. This has a full, slightly oily feel with girth and weight. Punchy, tart citrus and green-fruit flavors finish with lime, bell pepper and jalapeño notes.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Quite quinine and focused on the nose, underripe peach tones linger underneath. The well-balanced palate plays between juicy peach and shocks of lime, leading to a talc-dusted finish.",US-Michigan-Riesling
"Aromas of black currant and cherry set the stage for flavors of cassis, leather, juniper berry and dark chocolate. There is a nice balance of fruit and deeper savory notes, and velvety tannins make way for a splash of cherry on the lingering finish.",Georgia-Kakheti-Saperavi
"Waxy, weird aromas of lemon and ham are all over the map. This feels heavy, with a sense of sugary weight. Chunky flavors of cured pork and creamy melon finish plump but amorphous.",Spain-Northern Spain-Chardonnay

"Grassy and borderline pungent in character, there's nevertheless enough white grapefruit to support the wine and give it a refreshing, citrusy core. It's not that rich or weighty, but boasts a pleasant silky texture and a bright, clean finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a blend of several vineyards, instead of the winery's usual single-vineyard Chards. It's been tastefully assembled, and displays good Central Coast acidity framing tropical fruit and oak flavors with a stony, minerally edge.",US-California-Chardonnay

Mulberry, plum, cinnamon and a dash of truffle salt all combine in a plush, generous, well-integrated wine, with a rich, textural mouthfeel.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A brisk, sturdy Cabernet, marked by firm tannins, tart acidity and a marked coating of sweet, smoky oak. It's Janzen's basic Napa Cabernet, and shows the winery's ability to produce elegant Cabs. But it's not an ager.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Light bodied and lightly flavored, this wine is a good, basic meal-time beverage. It is dry, nicely tart and nearly neutral in aroma and flavor.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"A whiff of clover jumps from the glass, then this dark, juicy wine rips into a dense cassis flavor. Ripe and sappy, it has just the right touch of new oak layered onto the finish.",US-Washington-Malbec
"The inaugural release of this producer's GSM blend is comprised of 55% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 12% Mourvèdre. Jammy and dense in blackberry, espresso and leather, it offers a mouthful of flavor and intensity without ever becoming over the top.",US-California-G-S-M
"Aromas include oak extract, yellow flower, citrus zest and Mediterranean herb. The palate offers butterscotch and vanilla but not much fruit richness or freshness.",Italy-Tuscany-Vernaccia

The back label mentions that the grapes were sourced from Bacigalupi Vineyards, a longstanding star in the Russian River Valley.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Lots of pepper and spice in this dry, briary red blend. Could be Zinfandel, except it's not. The components are Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. A good value for a wine this complex and delicious.",US-California-Red Blend
"This is leafy and red smelling at first, then becoming raw and candied tasting, with a herbal note.",Chile-Central Valley-Carmenère
"Dark pink-orange in color, this pungent 100% varietal wine was given no time in oak, allowing its crisp orange peel, grapefruit and cherry flavors to shine. Moderate acidity underlies the simple finish.",US-California-Zinfandel

"This 1967 is part of Taylor Fladgate's regular releases of aged Colheita. It is showing a perfect moment in which the fruit finally passes into old gold maturity. The wine still has hints of sultanas, but now it's the fine wood and spice character that is equally important. The wine, of course, is ready to drink and will not age further.",Portugal-Port-Port

"Fresh, crisp currant and melon flavors, with lively acidity and intense, fresh fruit. This is a delicious fruit salad of tastes, light and vibrant.",Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner

"From a vineyard owned by veterans John and Helen Falcone in the Creston district, this expertly integrated bottling combines blackberry jam, thyme and white pepper on the elegant nose.

"Marked by superripe, jammy blackberry and currant flavors that taste like they were baked into a pie, this Cab also has plenty of sweet, caramelized oak. It leaves little to the imagination. Good, but would benefit from greater nuance and complexity.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"The “**” designation on this wine indicates the exceptional selection process used to pick intensely ripe, late-harvest grapes for this Auslese. Just a hint off dry, it's exceptionally full bodied with a rich, minerally palate accented by flecks of sweet stonefruit and honey. Brisk acidity offsets the voluptuous mouthfeel.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling

Drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend

"This is a powerful, ripe wine, touched by its wood aging while having rich yellow fruits and a dense structure. Nervous tension comes from the acidity and the strongly mineral texture. It's a magnificent wine that needs aging, so drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

It has natural denseness and firmness that fuel a long and satisfying finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Available only in magnums, this Chard consists of a single barrel from the estate vineyard, which is in the Petaluma area, a very cool region. The wine is very fine. It's equal parts ripe green pears, Meyer lemons and smoky oak, with a firm, steely underpinning of minerals. Should age well for a Chardonnay, especially in the big bottle.",US-California-Chardonnay

"This is a very new-wood dominated wine, that will appeal to lovers of California Cabernet. Blackcurrant jelly fruits are there as well, very modern, very polished. It is a fine wine, but maybe not Bordeaux.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a full-bodied and fruity wine. It has ripe red berry fruits as well as layers of warm citrus and fresh acidity. It's the richness that shows most strongly here, from the fruit to the texture, very much a house style of Ruinart. Drink now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend

"There's no doubting this is a rich wine. It's flamboyant in jammy cherry, boysenberry and cola flavors, while oak adds pronounced char and vanilla. It's the most expensive wine ever released by the winery, but tasty as it is, it's sweet and simple. Tasted four times.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Showing its age, but unfortunately not very well, this wine has lost any semblance of freshness, with notes of overripe lemons, stone fruit, pressed buttercups and buttered green beans. The palate is more attractive in its creamy texture, balanced by plenty of acidity. The finish once again descends into rather off-putting buttered green bean flavors.",Australia-Western Australia-Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon
"It's sappy and just a bit rustic, with layers of leather and saddle sweat along with sweet blueberry and blackberry fruit.

"Grapefruit, citrus and flowers on the nose are followed by a lively, slightly sweet array of fun flavors in this “early” wine. Released young, it has an effervescent quality that makes it a nice choice for a warm weather sip or accompaniment to dessert. Not terribly complex, but appealing.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"This wine varies in quality and perception based on when in its lifespan you taste it. Now, toward the end of the line, it's tropical and hanging in there, with green apple, citrus and other typical SB aromas and flavors. Even with 15% Carmenère in the blend for kicks, it's standard and workmanlike.",Chile-Central Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine is a blend of Art Den Hoed Petite Sirah (80%) and Gunkel Vineyard Zinfandel. Aromas of barrel spice, vanilla, raspberry and purple fruit are followed by full-bodied palate-coating fruit flavors, brightened by fresh acidity. The interest is as much about feel as flavor.",US-Washington-Red Blend

"The addition of 5% Sémillon proves to be the right call in this white, a structured, spritzy glass of tree-ripened apricot and exotic lemongrass with a pleasant heft to the palate. A twist of ripeness gives a mouthwatering, juicy finish.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Dried sage, fresh yeast and salty miso, shot through with lemon acidity, meet to make an incredibly savory, spicy but concentrated and streamlined palate with a lot of power. There is weight here, but nothing is bulky, it's pure, toned muscle. This still needs time. Drink as of 2017",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"This is 100% varietal with all of the fruit coming from 1989 plantings. Bittersweet chocolate, green herb and barrel aromas are followed by cherry flavors with a chalky feel.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Strapping aromas of blackberry and licorice are fiery and grating. This Syrah-led blend from a hot vintage is mighty tannic, so much so that it collapses under tannic weight. Flavors of blackberry, prune and cherry are spicy, while this tastes rooty and warm on the finish. Drink through 2019.",Spain-Central Spain-Red Blend
"Stalky, flat scents vie for attention with brighter citrus aromas on a bland nose. This Txakoli feels round but not too lively. Flavors of lettuce, green bean, green apple and tangerine finish with a hint of lime.",Spain-Northern Spain-White Blend
"Orange peel and pine are the main aromas on a slightly oily nose. This feels full and balanced, with flavors of mango, banana and lychee. There isn't a lot of complexity to a citrusy finish, but this still ranks as an excellent sweet Moscatel.",Spain-Andalucia-Moscatel
"So pretty and polished, a captivating wine. Dry and crisp, it has an elegant, silky mouthfeel, with subtle spice, red cherry sour candy, Dr. Pepper cola and sandalwood flavors. A complex and delicious Pinot Noir to drink over the next 5–6 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Mild apricot, mineral and almond flavors combine for a quiet and dry approach. It is full bodied, rather rich in texture, but well balanced by acidity. A subtle toasted-nut nuance lingers on the finish.",US-California-White Blend
"Zonin's 2006 Amarone opens with very ripe aromas of raspberry and strawberry jam followed by spice, leather and tobacco. Those raisin and dried fruit flavors appear again on the palate, pushed forward by the wine's thickness and soft sweetness.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"A powerful, almost black-colored Port. It has the richness of the vintage allied to ripe blackberry flavors, and a mineral, tannic structure. Its great fruit makes it almost drinkable now, but aging will add so many more dimensions.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Soft bubbles and bracing acidity meld with sweet-tart wild-berry and red-cherry flavors in this cheeky, effervescent treat. A pétillant naturel fermented on it's own indigenous yeasts, there's a distinctly untamed, sauvage feel to this Merlot sparkler that's hard to resist.",US-New York-Sparkling Blend
"Subtle aromas of smoke, Bartlett pear and Granny Smith apple carry over to the palate along with a citrusy note and a hint of raw almond.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Quiet aromas of peach and nectarine are subdued in nature. This feels melony, with pulpy weight cut by solid acidity. Nectarine, melon and apple are standard-issue flavors, while the finish is mild and fleshy in feel.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Smooth and rich, a wine that seems soft rather than focused. Hints of wood add to the attraction, while pear and lychee flavors give further ripeness. It probably needs several months, or a year, to come together.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A finely structured wine, well spiced with ripe berry fruits and intense but balanced acidity. This is stylish, attractive and is worth aging for 3-4 years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Though replanted, the vines designated for this bottling were taken from cuttings of the original vineyard blocks dating back to the early 1970s. Pretty in color, aroma and overall balance, this offers substantial black cherry fruit at its core, buttressed with barrel flavors of cacao. The wine shows good penetration and power, helped by aging 16 months in 38% new barrels.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Toast, lightly roasted Marcona almonds, a touch of hazelnut and hints of melon and lemon blossom converge on the nose of this delicious and cleanly made wine. The flavors are savory, full of lemon zest and sea salt, hinged together by lines of well-rounded acidity. It would pair with everything from lighter fish dishes to smoked chicken.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A late-harvest blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Sémillon from a good year for botrytis, this is dark gold in color. It offers sweet, lush and satisfying swaths of dried apple and orange that linger on the palate, finished with a drop of honey.",US-California-White Blend
"This richly structured wine has dark tannins as well as crisp red fruits and acidity. From old vines, it shows firmness and density. Another year will add elegance to the ripe texture. Drink from 2016.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Very dry, crisp and elegantly structured, this Pinot Noir can be had at a pretty good price. It has modest flavors of cherries, tobacco and spices, but is a little unripe, with hints of green tomato and white pepper.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Brooding aromas of crushed rock, mineral, black olive, soot, cracked black pepper, charcuterie and dried herb lead to fresh, focused flavors that are flavorful but remain light on their feet. It shows a bit more tannic heft than this area often shows along with great length on the meaty finish.",US-Oregon-Syrah
"Lush and mouthfilling, this tropical-fruited Chard offers a ton of flavors at a surprisingly small price. Smoky toasted-almond notes accent star fruit and guava flavors. Drink now–2011.",Australia-Victoria-Chardonnay
Tangy red fruits are the hallmark of this Cabernet/Merlot blend (there's also a tiny bit of Syrah in it). Juicy strawberry and cherry candy flavors meld with a touch of earth and darker streaks of coffee.,US-Washington-Red Blend
"There's so much oak on this Pinot Noir, you might think you were tasting a dessert made with vanilla cream and toasted meringue, like the crust on a baked Alaska. Under all that, loads of ripe raspberries and cherries. Shows the excellent hallmarks of a fine Santa Rita Pinot Noir, but certainly is one of the oakier versions.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Round, floral, fruity and just a bit bretty. Almost everything is right about this value-priced wine. The fruit is dark and veers toward black cherry and plum, while the feel is good. Finishes with a nice run of dry oak and chocolate flavors.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Merlot
"Regrettably, this has no sweetness scale on the back label, but the 11.5% alcohol suggests that it is off-dry, as it certainly tastes. It's a heavy, honey-soaked style, perhaps due to grapes that were affected by botrytis. Apple juice and honey flavors are right in the heart of this wine, which would pair well with a simple dessert of fresh fruit.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Quite charred and hard, which is something I can't remember in tasting VM's wines for the past decade. It's also plummy and thick, with a flat palate that doesn't register on the mouthfeel meter. Flavors of black fruits are lemony from the oak and generic, while the finish is round and basic.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Malbec
"One of South Africa's oldest wine estates, established in 1692, has revolutionized its wine cellar and its wine in the past five years. This Chardonnay is typical of the estate's wines, oozing rich fruit and modern wood flavors, yet retaining a style and elegance that is as much French as South African.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Chardonnay
"Here's a Barolo that harkens back to the 1990s thanks to its aggressive oak, which was once so in vogue. It's loaded with toasted oak, espresso and vanilla aromas, while the palate offers oak, coffee, plum and tongue-drying wood tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This wine has power along with great fruit and a rich structure. Yellow fruits are laced with a more finessed texture that adds minerality. It is a dense wine, full of fruit, with a measured touch of wood. Age this until 2021.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Coming in one of the most beautiful bottles on the market, this wine offers very forward aromas of honeyed almonds, browned butter, caramelized apples, daffodils and honeysuckle. There's a marzipan-powered nuttiness on the palate along with candied apples, but lemon zest acidity holds it together. This wine overpowers white fish, but excels with cheese.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Touches of wood, not new, give this wine spice and roundness. It is an attractive, citrus-flavored wine, with yellow fruits coming from behind as the wine opens up. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Made entirely with organically grown Sangiovese, with no added sulfites, this medium-bodied red opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, underbrush, game and black-skinned fruit. The lively palate doles out ripe black plum, wild cherry and crushed raspberry accented by subtle notes of white pepper and clove.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Darker in color than many other versions of the variety, this bottling shows hearty charred meat, blackberry, gravel and condensed rose petal aromas. There's a leathery structure to the palate, where peppercorn, tobacco and red fruit notes lead into a mocha-laced finish.While it lacks the typical Cabernet Franc freshness, it has plenty of depth.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"This wine is a very pale peach color. Aromas of strawberry candy, watermelon and citrus peel lead to light dry-fruit flavors. The concentration seems a bit lacking.",US-Washington-Rosé
"Aromas of yellow stone fruit, white spring flower and a whiff of citrus lift out of the glass. The soft round palate offers ripe apricot, yellow peach and a hint of candied nectarine zest.",Italy-Tuscany-Vermentino
"Lots of toasty, caramelized oak tones combine with ripe flavors of pineapples, pears and green apples. It seems a little sweet on the finish, but that's balanced by a swirl of acidity. Drink now.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A very nice, elegant Pinot Noir. Shows clean crispness and pedigree, with fine acidity framing dry flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, bacon and cola. A rich feel. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A terrific effort, this is a full-bodied, almost Port-like expression of Cornas. Asphalt, espresso and tapenade notes make for an intriguing bouquet, then pick up plum and earth on the palate. The finish is long, velvety and packed with drying tannins, so give it until at least 2018, then drink through 2025 or so.",France-Rhône Valley-Syrah
"A small-production Grenache from 100-plus-year-old vines, this wine is dusty and fragrant with ripe cherry and strawberry flavors. Light in weight and easy to drink, the undercurrent whispers licorice.",US-California-Grenache
"Made in the modern cult style, this soft, ripely lush Cabernet is immediately likeable for its blackberry-pie filling, black currant liqueur, chocolate, licorice and smoky sweet oak flavors. It's California Cabernet at its heady, opulent best. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fresh, crisp white peach and apple aromas are bright and breezy on this refreshing unoaked Chardonnay. It's not robustly concentrated, but zesty acidity keeps it quaffable and brisk.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Rich in jammy cherry and chocolate flavors, and with finely ground, ripe tannins, this Merlot hails from an inland Sonoma County appellation. The wine is a little simple, but is elegant and very easy to drink.",US-California-Merlot
"Dusty, earthy and herbal defines the nose on this minty Cab. There are also whiffs of animal and pickle on the bouquet. This feels raw and tight, with crisp acids and peppery, lightly herbal flavors of plum and berry. A minty, dry finish is slightly harsh.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Intense perfumes give this fine apéritif wine an exotic character. Its crisp texture balances this, showcasing fine lime and grapefruit flavors as well as a touch of lychee. The acidity at the end is lively and refreshing. Drink now.",Portugal-Lisboa-Arinto
"This Barolo reflects the difficult 2009 vintage with its combination of overripe and green sensations. The palate has some dark cherry flavor, but also a green, astringent character and a warm midpalate, while the finish is bitter and drying.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"The aromas are similar to the above wine, maybe a little less forward and earthier, but still dominated by tropical fruit and oaky complexities. It drinks quite a bit softer, though, with lower acidity, which makes it seem richer, fatter, and more user friendly. You can taste the pretty fruit on the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Raisin-baked plum defines this hearty, full-bodied and ultraripe wine, rich in red berry and robust on the finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Actually a blend of Zin plus 10 other minor varietals in an old field blend, this complex wine fascinates with its intricately interlocked flavors. There's a sensation a second. Bottom line: This wine is delicious, ripely sweet although technically dry, and ageworthy.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Zippy and fresh in the mouth, well balanced, with eye-opening fresh green herb and lemon peel flavors. The same green herb, plus some petrol, shows on the nose. A gravelly, minerally finish brings it to a dry close.",Australia-South Australia-Riesling
"This wine comes off as quite green especially considering the variety, vintage and appellation. Aromas of bell pepper and green herbs lead to cherry and savory flavors, with the tannins bringing some heft.",US-Washington-Merlot
"With 7% Malbec, this hearty red is tightly wound in youthful tannins and a smoky cloud of complex flavor. Leathery and earthy, it traffics in plum, blackberry and chocolate, intertwining the rich ripe fruit into a harmonious whole that pleases the palate.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The variety seems to get lost in the aromas, with light notes of lees, stone fruit and almond. This wine is full in feel, with elegant peach flavors.",US-Washington-Viognier
"Wood-aged and ripe, this is a solid, tannic wine. With mint over black fruits and firm new wood flavors, it will need to age. It is powerful on the palate from all the wood tannins and dense structure. Drink from 2017.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Strikingly fresh blueberry and blackberry flavors light up this dry, medium-bodied wine.Relatively light on the palate, it's leaner than most of its peers.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This is dry and brisk in acidity, with firm tannins and great structural integrity. At the same time, it's vast in blackberry and cherry-jam flavors, while the oak overlay is strong but perfectly matched with the wine's volume. Very fine, complex and elegant, this is a Cabernet to cellar for eight years; it could be one for the long haul.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A rich, savory Pinot Gris that's just a little sweet, and has a slight fizziness that makes it lively. Rich in citrus, tropical fruit, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors, brightened with brilliant acidity, it shows a buttery smokiness from neutral oak. Drink this refreshing wine now.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"All the parts here are good. The color is rich and dark, the aromas and flavors are rich and ripe, the tannins are velvety and fine, acidity provides a kick of brightness, and the oak is just right. Somehow though it doesn't come together yet. The palate feels the  edges. Time may soften them.",US-California-Meritage
"Brisk and refreshing in the mouth, with stimulating acidity. But it's a little too sweet in the combination of jammy citrus fruit and smoky oak.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Black fruits, fine herbs and horsehide carry the aromas of this offering. In the mouth, this is firm and well built, with integrated tannins. Savory flavors of soy sauce and roast plum share space with bolder, riper cherry notes, while a warm, earthy finish tastes of roasted plum and berry. Drink through 2021.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Great structure, with crisp, supportive acids and a fine overlay of oak that seasons but doesn't overwhelm. The flavors are quite lean. The winemaker calls them mineral-like, but it's more like grapefruits and lemons. The main problem with this well-made wine is, in fact, this lack of flavor.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A juicy, jammy blend of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Montepulciano and 8% Zinfandel sourced primarily from Contra Costa County that's packed with blue and blackberry fruit, tobacco and plum. Clean and bright with a chewy texture.",US-California-Red Blend
"This is sourced from 30-year-old Wädenswil vines from a vineyard in the Elkton AVA. It's complex and compelling, showing layers of stone, strawberry, citrus, chocolate and sassafras. It's an elegant wine, well proportioned and modest in scope, but delicious.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This is a remarkably well-priced yet classic Mosel-style beerenauslese. It's deeply concentrated with unctuous honey and peach flavors, dusted with a veil of pollen and crushed minerals. It's effortlessly spry yet electric on the palate, with a high-toned lemon-lime finish.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"With the potential of a good structure and fruit, this is a warm ripe wine that has concentration and dense black fruits. The acidity at the end gives it a lift. Wait until 2019 to drink this Hervé Lhuillier wine.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The impression is that some of the fruit may have teetered on the edge of overripe, as the wine has a grainy, sugary mouthfeel. It's not overtly sweet, just granular, and the pear fruit flavors are lightly honeyed. It's best to drink this by late 2016.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"With brick-colored edges and gritty aromas of turned earth, raw oak, asphalt and berry fruits, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot feels tight, with rubbery tannins. Oak-infused flavors of herbal blackberry, mint and anise finish with notes of licorice and chocolate as well as a touch of heat. Drink through 2021.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Red Blend
"Aromas of crushed roses, violet, tilled earth, forest floor, leather and balsamic notes all come together. The palate delivers juicy black cherry accented with thyme, white pepper, mocha and subtle oak. It's still young, with brisk acidity and compact tannins but already shows finesse and balance. Drink after 2020.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This is a young tawny (in this case, on average five-years-old) that has kept all its fruit and just added perfumed dried fruits and touches of spice and attractive oxidation from the wood aging. The wine is soft, ripe and easy to drink.",Portugal-Port-Port
"A slightly high-toned scent of lemon candy, pineapple and peach opens the door to this delicious Dijon clone Chardonnay. Aged 11 months in neutral French oak, it's lively and concentrated, with a finishing lick of butterscotch.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Aromas of exotic spice, incense and aromatic herb lead the way. On the racy palate, hints of dark spice and cranberry add interest to the wild cherry core while vibrant acidity and supple tannins make it fresh and easy drinking.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This wine, which has a surprisingly evolved light garnet color with some brick on the edges, opens with a delicate floral perfume of violet, red berry and cinnamon. The spicy palate offers red cherry, white pepper, clove and cinnamon alongside fleeting tannins and a note of warm alcohol. Not much weight or complexity and extremely approachable for such a young Brunello.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Here's an easy and affordable Ripasso that makes an excellent choice for informal, home-cooked meals. Pasta, risotto or fried pork chops would work well against the wine's fresh acidity, medium build and bright fruit flavors.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Crisp black-plum aromas are lifted by lavender, lilac and potpourri scents on the nose of this blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon and 35% Syrah. Lavish flavors of boysenberry pie, vanilla, nutmeg and pastry dough show on the layered palate. It furnishes another strong case for why these two grapes work well together.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"Nussbaumer is a fresh and beautifully intense expression of Gewürztraminer from northern Italy that lavishes on bright aromas of honeysuckle, citrus blossom and jasmine. The wine is almost too perfumed and shows thick, waxy creaminess on the close.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Gewürztraminer
"Stout up front, the nose is packed with black-fruit aromas. The palate feels a bit prickly and raw, while blackberry flavors run quick, with a chocolaty oak character popping up on a lean finish.",Argentina-Other-Malbec
"Made using fruit that was sourced from 30- and 40-year-old plantings, this has captivating flavors of black cherry and cassis, wrapped in brambly hints of herb. It shows plenty of intense power, with many more layers surfacing with breathing time. In fact, it's just as good on its second day.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Honey, chamomile, acacia and toasted oak aromas follow through to the palate, with yellow apple and a citrus drop flavors. A bitter almond note closes the finish. Drink soon to capture the remaining freshness and fruit.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"Single (777) clone, half new French oak, packed with flavor—this is ready to go. Concentrated flavors of black cherry, cola and vanilla, adorned even further with dusty sweet spices, make this a grab-and-go kind of wine. There's a lightly funky umami character to the finish, along with more barrel notes of coffee and caramel.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This wine from southern Italy shows notes of ripe cherry, prune, cinnamon and leather. The mouthfeel is soft and seemingly sweet, making this an excellent pairing partner to tomato-based pasta sauces.",Italy-Southern Italy-Primitivo
"This is 100% single vineyard Merlot; broad, beautifully integrated, with seamless black fruits, streaks of coffee and smoke, and black pepper spice. A powerful Merlot with muscle and verve, it finishes smooth and lightly tasting of chocolate.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Another fine estate-grown Pinot Gris from Vista Hills, with plenty of green apple and Bosch pear fruit, along with some light cinnamon spice. There is also a suggestion of flower in both the nose and the mouth, but overall it's a bigger wine than that, with the fruit front and center.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"From two sections of the producer's historic estate vineyard, this wine combines 53% Viognier, 33% Roussanne and 14% Marsanne, all fermented and aged in stainless steel. Together, they offer a dry balanced expression of green apple, Meyer lemon, tart pineapple and integrated oak.",US-California-Rhône-style White Blend

"Always a terrific value, this refreshing white has aromas of fragrant white flower, mint and orchard fruit. The straightforward palate offers crunchy Granny Smith apple, a hint of orange zest and a crisp clean finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Vernaccia
"This is bottled in one of those tall, thin Alsace-type bottles, and while it's technically a dry table wine, it could almost be a dessert wine. There's a sugary edge to the peach, pineapple, honey and wildflower flavors. With crisp acidity, the wine is basically off-dry.",US-California-Viognier
"In the ongoing debate about how well Muscadet can age, this wine gives a good answer: yes it can. There is no sign of the fruit declining; in fact it seems to have become richer and fuller. The texture has softened to give a smooth, creamy wine that is still bright, although very ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"Maybe the friendliest Hirsch bottling, this wine has wonderful complexity, medium body and a broad supple texture that make it a pleasure to taste. It has spicy lightly earthy aromas, plenty of raspberry, red cherry and rhubarb for fruit flavors, and a good sense of layering on the palate, followed by a long finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a particular style of Albariño. Aromas of white flowers distant mineral and green melon set up a plump, layered palate, with core acidity but also flatness that will only increase the longer it goes. Flavors of nectarine, orange and melon register as citric but also creamy. This is a unique Galician white that's stylish but won't last forever; drink immediately.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Firm and chewy, this pure Syrah has plenty of punch (at 14.6% alcohol) but not much detail. A clean, crisp core of tangy berry is framed in large, dry, somewhat chalky tannins, and finishes with a hit of chocolate.",US-Washington-Syrah
"The bouquet offers intriguing aromas of berry, black olive, vanilla and other barrel spices. The chocolate and cherry flavors are elegant, soft and creamy in feel, showing a pleasing sense of balance. A delicious and attractive red that's drinkable now.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"A full, ripe creamy wine with a fine balance between fresh red berries and pink grapefruit crispness. There is spice, followed by a mouthful of complex berries, red plums and a firm texture. This is already delicious, but could certainly age over several years.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This ripe, fruity wine has soft tannins and a generous, warm character that makes it already drinkable. Better, however, to wait until its full potential is realized, from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Heavy oak on the nose means aromas of pencil lead, wet cement and blacktop are in the lead. This wine feels resiny and tannic, with a similar woody flavor accenting herbal black fruit. Although this is a good Cabernet, it's quite oaky.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A delicious and interesting white wine, made from a variety more usually used for blending purposes. It's honey-rich but dry, similar in structure to an oaky Chardonnay, with tropical fruit and vanilla flavors that have a pleasant touch of bitterness.",US-California-Grenache Blanc
"The vineyard is in the Carneros district, which makes you wonder why the winery doesn't so identify it. The wine shows brisk, mouthwatering acidity and flavors that range from ripe tropical fruits through lemons and grapefruits to tart gooseberries.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"A tremendous rendition of the variety from an appellation not particularly associated with it, this wine is deftly etched with notes of black licorice, leather and earth. Explosive tannins underscore its core of juicy blackberry and smoke flavors, while the finish is sticky and somewhat feral.",US-California-Syrah
"Produced from a field blend of old vines in a gravity-fed winery at Quinta da Faísca, this is a concentrated and structured wine from grapes grown in the Vale de Mendiz in the heart of the Douro. Still young and still masking the black fruits with the tannins, it is slow to develop. It is rich, though, full in the mouth and likely to be a fine wine as it slowly matures. Drink from 2019.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This opens with an unusual combination of aromas including resin, cured meat, raisin, game and grilled herb. The aromas carry over to the evolved, one-dimensional palate along with raspberry jam and chewy tannins. It's already approachable, so drink over the next few years.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This oak-aged Merlot, which includes 10% Sangiovese for extra acidity and brightness, opens with spice, wood shop, toasted almond and ripe cherry notes. It offers a chewy, succulent quality, and it finishes with a dark fruit flavor.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"At the moment, the 2010 Réservée is intense but moody, showing a smoky, gamy, feral side. The fruit is subdued but concentrated, picking up multiple earthy, spicy nuances including iodine and licorice. It's a big wine, with chewy tannins that leave the impression of fine suede behind on the long finish.Give it another five years in the cellar.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Made entirely with Aglianico, this has alluring delicate scents evoking wild rose and red berry. The vibrant palate offers juicy sour cherry, raspberry and tangerine zest alongside crisp acidity that leaves a bright refreshing finish.",Italy-Southern Italy-Rosato
"Almost colourless, it tastes like sugar water with some acidity thrown in. Gently fruity, the sweetness comes along with flavors of green grapes.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White
"Very pithy aromas of grapefruit, squeezed lemon, crisp Asian pear and a touch of chalk show on the nose of this bottling, another strong argument about how well this variety can do in cool coastal California. The flavors are light and crisp, with yellow apple and yellow-grapefruit pith most prominent.",US-California-Albariño

"Blue flower, ripe cherry, leather and cake spice aromas carry over to the palate along with velvety tannins. Reflecting the heat of the vintage, it's forward and evolved with soft acidity. Drink through 2019.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"Showing ripe peach, pineapple and honeysuckle flavors, this Chard, from the cooler southern part of the valley, is balanced with crisp acidity. Oak plays a prominent role, offering spicy crème brûlée complexities.",US-California-Chardonnay
"With easily enjoyed flavors of cherries, raspberries and cola, and a nice coat of sweetly smoked sandalwood, this is a pleasant Pinot Noir to drink now. The light body, and some sharpness on the finish, argue against ageability.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The best yet from NxNW, this deep, earthy, loamy Cabernet is sourced from Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills—top Walla Walla vineyards. Tight raspberry and huckleberry fruit is coated with dusty chocolate, coffee grounds and a lick of tobacco. Tannins are still a little chalky and unintegrated, but a little breathing time smoothes them out.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Although this Chard is unoaked, its has strong flavors of vanilla and crème brûlée, in addition to the tropical fruits, roasted green apples and sweet lemon custard. It's direct and strong, an inexpensive Chard to pair with rich fare, like scallops in cream sauce.",US-California-Chardonnay

"From vines in the Tua Valley, a tributary of the Douro, this is a rich wine, structured with dark and firm tannins. Although it is mature, the fruit is still fresh with black-plum flavors and a touch of dark chocolate. Drink the wine now and until 2020.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Dark and impenetrable with bold oak nuances, sweet vanilla extract and layers of Indian spice, this is a rich and dense wine that should be consumed with succulent cuts of meat. The tannins are tight and firm and this wine will age for many years to come.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"The peel of Bosc pear and riper stone fruit are the chief aromatic markers of this wine. The palate is light, slight and crisp with an earthier, slightly bitter edge. Drink soon while aromas are at their height.",France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"Rather quiet at first, this wine unfurls into a soft but textured palate. This balanced white lives more off structure than aroma; the herbal white pepperiness is to be savored.",Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
"One of the best Malbecs on the market. It's perfect for drinking now despite big tannins. Shows vast, deep blackberry, blueberry, dark chocolate, currant and anise flavors, with a long, spicy finish. Grill up a steak and pop the cork.",US-California-Malbec
"There's a tinge of herbaceous green stem amidst fresh apple and lemon aromas on this Sauvignon Blanc blended with 10% Albariño. Marked with nervous lime acidity, it's lean on the palate with a hint of lime-skin bitterness on the finish.",US-New York-Sauvignon Blanc
"A simple wine, it tastes overoaked and thin in oranges and apricots, with brisk acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay

It's savory and incredibly easy to drink.",Italy-Piedmont-Sparkling Blend

"This opens with a floral fragrance of honeysuckle and lavender, with hints of stone fruit and smoke. The palate offers flavors of white peach, citrus and dried apricot, with touches of butterscotch and oak on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-White Blend
"Scents of chamomile, tropical fruit and citrus zest lead the nose on this vibrant blend of Friulano, Chardonnay and Sauvignon. The structured, savory palate offers layers of yellow peach, candied lemon drop, nut and mineral alongside bright acidity that leaves a tangy finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend
"The new oak on this Pinot Noir dominates now with aromas and flavors of buttered toast and caramel. But underneath all that is a wine rich with raspberries, cherries, red licorice and mocha, and balanced with vital acidity. Give it a few years to let everything integrate.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Light and clear in color, this impish wine needs time to grow up in the bottle, its profile momentarily giving way almost entirely to savory Asian five-spice and a sharp acidity that should interweave together expertly over the years. Vibrant and complex, the fruit is sultry and dusted in earth. Set this one down through 2017.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This has intense forest-floor aromas, a hint of violet along and toasted oak and vanilla notes. The palate shows bright raspberry and espresso flavors, nervous acidity and firm tannins. It needs time, so drink after 2016.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Aromatic herb, pressed rose, blue flower, menthol and mature berry aromas lift out of the glass. The firmly structured palate offers raspberry compote, licorice and grilled sage alongside tightly wound tannins. Drink 2019–2024.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Extremely elegant and restrained at first on the nose, this bottling eventually shows gravel and crushed rocks, with hints of blackberry and forest underbrush also emerging. A very firm structure weaves together an incredibly well-integrated wine, with dense mulberry and dried-fennel notes that morph into crushed herbs with time. Drink 2018–2032.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine has all the tannins you would expect from Gevry, although with some suppleness. They are surrounded by ripe red berry fruits, a rich texture of spice and delicious, refreshing acidity. It's a dense wine, complex and worth aging. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This has ripe black cherry and fig aromas accompanied by prune and black cherry flavors. It's simple but well made, and has nice freshness. It would pair seamlessly with ravioli stuffed with porcini mushrooms.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"The savory, yeasty nose comes with a hint of spicy sandalwood. The palate echoes this rounded harmonious spiciness and plays more to those mellow tones than to the shades of fruit. The body comes with a lovely, inviting and appetizing light-footedness. The finish is long and clean.",Austria-Weinviertel-Grüner Veltliner
"Slightly sour Meyer-lemon-pith aromas meet with honeysuckle and yellow pear on the nose of this bottling by veteran Bob Lindquist. There is a strong sizzle of acidity on the sip, where green-apple flavors meet with tart nectarine and lime-peel zip. It's very fresh and food-friendly.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is intensely ripe and almost tropical, with yellow fruit and flower notes that are balanced with layers of smoke, wet stone and brisk, steely acidity. This is a dry yet lavishly textured wine, with flavors that meander long on the finish.",Germany-Rheinhessen-Riesling
"A big, heavy rosé, this has an orange-pink color and slightly sweet flavors of jammy raspberry, vanilla and cream. A blend of Syrah and Grenache.",US-California-Rosé
"Honeyed peach and rose petal notes dominate nose and palate. The rose perfume seems even more amplified on the rounded, off-dry and generous palate. Drink this while aromas are at their very peak.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Boushey Vineyard makes up two-thirds of this wine, with the rest coming from Seven Hills. Fruit-forward aromas of cranberry, cherry, plum and spice lead to a thoroughly charming fruit-laden palate that shows a lot of purity. It's unabashed in its appeal.",US-Washington-Sangiovese
"Like you might expect from a maturing gran reserva, Imaz offers glimpses of raisin, sweet berry and even some aged cheese. In the mouth, it's all about red fruit, although an earthy undertone provides some background. Feels a little stark, zesty and lean, while the finish is solid and tastes of vanilla and leather. Drink now through 2012.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of toast, mocha, dark berry, roasted herb and scorched soil slowly come together. The ripe, concentrated palate offers fleshy dark-skinned berry, clove and tobacco alongside a tannic backbone. Drink 2019–2024.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"91-93 Barrel sample. Full, ripe fruit, showing pear jucie, some wood spice and ripeness. It feels fat, full-bodied.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This tastes barely ripe, with a vegetal flavor compromsing the chocolate and cherry notes. It's soft, making it fall a little flat in the mouth.",US-California-Syrah
"Fresh and herbaceous, but concentrated with youthful apple and pear flavors, this elegantly balanced, full-bodied wine offers wide appeal. Refreshing and quaffable, it finishes briskly with a stream of lemony acidity.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Gamey notes with red berry aromas set up a big, burly, tannic palate. This Monastrell-Syrah blend deals medicinal plum and berry flavors that come with a mildly salty aftertaste. This is drying and lightly herbal on the finish.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"This Monastrell's scratchy, slightly soapy berry and cassis aromas are on the sweet and ripe side. Its baked plum and berry flavors are fleshy and lack focus, finishing with abrasive tannins.",Spain-Levante-Monastrell
"Fruity and oaky, with rich flavors of pineapples, pears, buttercream, vanilla cookie and toasty meringue. Crisp acidity provides clean balance.",US-California-Chardonnay

"This barrel-aged Soave conveys aromas of candied citrus, pineapple, and toasted oak. The palate delivers butterscotch, sugary vanilla and lemon drops in a low-impact, muted style.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"Here's a pungent and intense Italian sparkler (made with Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco and Pinot Nero) that opens with bright aromas of apricot, mature melon, white almond and yellow rose. The wine is smooth and silky, and there's a ripe, warm quality to the fruit flavors.",Italy-Lombardy-Sparkling Blend
"Chapuy is a négociant based in Mesnil-sur-Oger in the Chardonnay vineyards of the Côte des Blancs. This wine, made from grapes sourced exclusively from grand cru vineyards, is all citrus, mineral and apple skin flavors. It's a tight, taut effort with a crisp texture and a note of grapefruit on the finish. Worth aging for a few months.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"This perfumed wine, with a dry tannic core, is just beginning to soften. The potential for the black fruits is already there. Drink this solid wine from early 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"With its ripe red fruits and crisp acidity, this has a brightness that exudes charm and freshness. The aftertaste brings out a more textured character from a tangy orange zest flavor.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This is a nice, smooth Merlot, perfect for everyday drinking. It's dry and rich in tannins, with blackberry, currant, smoked meat and oak flavors.",US-California-Merlot
"Earthy, tarry plum and berry aromas are herbal and gritty. This is a forward Syrah with juicy acidity. Flavors of plum, currant, raspberry, tomato and herbs finish fresh, with lingering acids and spicy flavors that include fennel and licorice root. Drink this spicy, elegant Syrah now through 2017.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Syrah
"Soft, light in body and easy to drink, this Sangiovese, from the Napa estate vineyard, is delicious in raspberry, red currant, licorice, bacon and spice flavors. It's somewhat ephemeral, an instantly pleasant wine to drink especially with cured meats, olives, hard cheeses.",US-California-Sangiovese
"King Estate makes several different versions of Pinot Gris, but this belongs at the very top, with pitch-perfect pear fruit at its core. Fresh, textural and brightly racy, it's an elegant and generous wine with a crisp, lingering finish that suggests it will continue to improve through 2020.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Full and ripe, this wine also has good acidity that gives a lively edge to the yellow-fruit flavors. Along with the peach and apricot fruits, it presents refreshing crispness. The aftertaste delivers a great lift of acidity.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Minty at first, and herbal, the way a Cabernet can be, this Petit Verdot from Lodi is juicy and well made with licorice and spice and plenty of tannin structure. Its limp finish could signal the need for a bit more time in the cellar, perhaps 2–5 years.",US-California-Petit Verdot
"Subtle vanilla and baking spices accent plum and blueberry notes in Colombo's entry-level Cornas. It's medium in body, with a brightness and freshness to it that make it approachable young. Drink now–2025.",France-Rhône Valley-Syrah
"This opens with cool, coastal aromas of passion fruit, minerality, ocean spray and tarragon. It's just round enough to avoid being shearing, with cutting acidity and true varietal flavors of green herbs, lettuce and lime. The finish maintains those flavors while cleansing the palate.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"From one of the few estate properties in this new appellation comes anise-flecked aromas of blackberry puff pastry, mixing up ripe fruit with buttery oak. This is a very approachable Syrah, with dark fruits and pepper spice that will appeal widely, showing why Ballard Canyon may be the variety's best hope for popular acceptance.",US-California-Syrah
"A blend of Dolcetto grapes from different prized vineyard sites in Dogliani, this has a definite note of sophistication that comes across as spice, ripe fruit and tobacco. On the finish, the wine is smooth, textured and long lasting.",Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto

"This southern Rhône blend is a good everyday one. With its slightly sweet, jammy berry, cherry, cocoa, herb and spice flavors, it's an easy partner with burgers and fries.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Creamy in mouthfeel and spicy with acidity, this is a well-heeled, lightly crafted wine with integrated crispness and peach and lemon highlights.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"The aromas on this Rocks District wine pop with huckleberry, black and green olive, plum and mineral. It's dazzlingly polished and textured in feel, with nuanced, detailed smoked meat and savory flavors. It nonetheless retains an exquisite sense of balance and restraint, capped off by an outrageously long finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Light in color, with basic apple and green-melon aromas, this is a mild Verdejo with a fairly plump mouthfeel. A cross of melon and citrus flavors falls off on the finish before turning bitter.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"Sun-ripened pineapple, mango and honey burst from the nose of this plush, fruit-forward wine. The palate feels creamy and dense, but the finish is brightened by crisp edges of lemon and lime acidity.",US-New York-Chardonnay

"A lovely wine, drinkable now and over the next few years. Made from Merlot, the two Cabernets and a dash of Syrah, it's rich and lush in blackberry, blueberry, cured meat, black pepper and cedar flavors, wrapped into smooth, spicy tannins.",US-California-Red Blend
"Baked, earthy, reedy aromas yield to a narrow, tannic, awkward body. Sweet, green flavors are candied and flat. Time has passed this by.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Syrah
"An interesting wine you can call intellectual. Its appeal is as much conceptual as hedonistic. It's the opposite of today's soft, sweet fruit bombs, being bone dry and somewhat austere, showing a tightly knit tannic structure. With an explosive, but controlled, central core of blackberries, it's a cellar candidate. It will be fascinating to try this wine after 2014.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Patience will reward those who wait for this stunning wine to reveal itself. It's initially smoky and closed, but time and aeration bring out penetrating black-cherry and berry flavors. It's such a seductively perfumed wine with a lingering finish nuanced by spice and violet petals. High-toned acidity and fine upright tannins will keep this wine lively for many years to come.",US-New York-Pinot Noir
"Quilceda's Palengat is now a proprietary blend, not a strict Cabernet as before. You can smell the violets amidst nicely layered aromatics, built upon layers of black fruits, cassis and dark, smoky elements. Smoke, earth, coffee, a hint of iron and rock continue into the midpalate, which loses a little density as it moves through the finish. That may be a reflection of the young-ish (7 to 10 year old) vines.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Buttered toast and butterscotch flavors rule in this Chardonnay. The grapes bring ripe, pure flavors of mangoes, pineapples and tangerines. It's delicious, if a bit obvious in its appeals.",US-California-Chardonnay
This bitter wine is high-octane in puckering tannin and very ripe fruit. The finish leans towards a taste of pencil shavings and tobacco.,US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"At the equivalent of $4.75 a bottle, and with the staying power of its vacuum technology, this box wine is a pretty good buy. Bone dry and crisp, it has pleasant citrus fruit, vanilla and peppery spice flavors.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"Made in an exotic style that will divide purists into opposing camps. It's dark, rich and almost heavy, with the weight of a Grenache. Yet it's utterly delicious, dazzling in wild raspberry and cherry essence, thyme, cola, pie spice and sandalwood flavors. A fascinating wine that should do interesting things in the cellar.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine is quite light in color, with delicate aromas of cigar box, herb and spice. The cherry flavors are full and tart, with spice notes on the finish.",US-Washington-Sangiovese
"Light and tart, this simple and fruity style has hard candy flavors of sour cherry and raspberry. A fun wine, straightforward and good for chilling.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This powerfully ripe, direct Chardonnay shows massive flavors of pineapples, nectarines, green apples, vanilla and oaky buttered toast, brightened with crisp, coastal acidity. Nice with scallops in a saffron and coconut cream sauce.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Aromas include white spring flowers, banana peel and tropical fruit. The bright palate offers juicy white peach, green apple and citrus alongside lively acidity. It's simple but well-made.",Italy-Lombardy-Turbiana
"A ripe, balanced wine this is maturing well. It has a black plum note to go with the underlying tannins. Rich juicy flavors join notes of spice and wood, leading onto the firm finish. Age for another two years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine has an attractive salmon-pink color followed by ripe caramel and spice flavors. The fruit and acidity don't feature as strongly, so the end result is a wine that is fat.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"Dark pink in color, this off-dry wine is as soft as the velvet in its name. Strawberry dominates the flavor, along with attractive acidity and a smooth, round texture. A wine for apéritifs.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"A bit softer, plusher and creamier than the Shiraz-Cabernet from this producer, this is still an impressive wine. Smoky cedar and mocha notes complement plums and blackberries, turning velvety on the finish. Drink now through 2025.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"A blend of three vineyards, all estate, this is a sublime, viscous and somewhat briny wine that exhibits some oak on the nose. With a balance of weight and creaminess, it starts in ginger and nutmeg spiciness on the nose, building on the palate into fresh-cut apple and pear.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This well-made wine in a rich style smells like ripe pears and melted butter, and tastes soft and almost sweet, resembling pear and peach juice. The texture is smooth and soft and the body is medium, so it's easy to enjoy.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Inky dark in appearance and concentration, this muscular Recioto della Valpolicella Classico wraps your tongue tight with its blockbuster power and persistency. Aromas include blackberry jelly, chocolate, cola and exotic spice. It finishes with smooth firmness and loads of personality.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Soft and rounded, this rich wine brings out the smoother side of Sauvignon Blanc. With its apple and pear flavors, it has ripeness that is cut by lime acidity. Drink this wine from 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"As the Riverside County region finds its way, this grape may make a good white option. This winery, which was founded in 1969 by the golf magnate, delivers aromas of salted and honeyed apples, following by a balanced, precise and mineral-driven palate of apple, lemonade and grapefruit.",US-California-Roussanne
"Assertive and delicious, this light-bodied and dry wine has dramatic aromas of wood smoke, wet stones and even diesel. Those are classic for the German grape varieties from which it was made, as are the light peach and white pepper flavors that ride an elegant texture and slightly sweet balance.",US-California-White Blend
"Weighty and dry, Albariño is a rare sight in Sonoma. This one is well worth seeking, savory in nutty almond and a taste of grilled peach. Mouth quenching, it'll pair well with spicy Thai shrimp.",US-California-Albariño
"Dried herb aromas are at the fore, along with notes of flowers and red fruit. The palate is full of medium-bodied fruit and savory flavors that bring a lightly tacky lip-smacking feel. It's hard to place it as Grenache exactly but it brings enjoyment all the same.",US-Washington-Grenache
"This reserve-level Pinot from DDO is exceptional in every way. Silky, elegant and deeply-fruited, it marries a plush midpalate of red berries and cherries to compelling grace notes of pine needle, cola and mocha. Delicious and ageworthy; if past vintages are any indication, this can go until 2029.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"There's a fine line between a fresh Godello and one that's starting to turn. This one may soon fall into the latter category, but before it gets there look for peppery white-fruit aromas and flavors. Tastes of honeyed melon are  topped with cracked black pepper. Turns a bit creamy and sweet on the finish, another indication that it is starting to age.",Spain-Northern Spain-Godello
"Aromas of perfumed berry, mint baking spice, toast and espresso waft out of the glass. The palate is tight and rather primary at the moment, showing raw black cherry, raspberry, clove and toasted notes. It's still young but balanced, with fresh acidity and firm, fine–grained tannins. Drink 2016–2022.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A bit disappointing from veteran winemaker Alan McCorkindale, or maybe this is just sliding past its prime. The modest grapefruit notes, herbal overtones and tart finish are fine, but fail to excite. Drink up.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"This lower-priced Pinot from the Center of Effort team punches way above its weight in this vintage, showing light cherry-blossom and black-cherry aromas mixed with gamy meat and wet slate. Blackberry pie is cut with orange rind on the sip, with an earthy grip showing flavors of juniper, crushed clove and pipe tobacco.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This flavorful, lively red wine was made with 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, but it doesn't fall easily into a category. Earthy, herbal aromas turn spicy, smoky and rich with raspberry and blackberry flavors as you sip. The other four Bordeaux red grape varieties complete the blend.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Made with Zibibbo, this refreshing white offers floral and fruit aromas suggesting white rose and yellow stone fruit. The lively palate tastes of apricot, lemon zest and a hint of aromatic herb alongside bright acidity.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Zibibbo
"Leather, earth and a vinegar-like volatility are the aromatics. The palate is, not surprisingly, choppy and crisp, with narrow berry fruit flavors and a lactic element courtesy of barrel aging. Linear and tight on the finish, with acidic snap",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This marks two years in a row that this wine ranks low. It's dull, devoid of aromas and sour. Tastes green and bland, with little to latch onto. Just never gets going.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is bright and citrusy on the nose and palate with a distinctly chalky minerality and delicate, almost lacy, mouthfeel. It's lean and focused with fresh lemon acidity and zest notes  that extend on the finish.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Firm and muscular, with mixed berries and cherry fruit, this beautifully defined Cabernet shows excellent penetration and focus. The finish is long, smoky, and carries a hint of gun metal.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"One of the labels from the Bonnet vineyard of André Lurton, this red follows the approachable, fruity style of these wines. Red berry fruits and soft tannins make it already drinkable.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Vanilla, cedar and mint notes mark the nose, while this wine boasts just enough fruit on the plate to carry the lavish oak. It's full bodied, creamy and supple, amply concentrated but still very approachable. Drink now–2023.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Coffee bean, leather and tobacco tones are surrounded by delicate aromas of wild berry, violet and spice. The tannins are tight and bone dry, making for a good pairing with cheese fondue.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Hard and charred on the nose at first, this sheds its tire-like aromas for cleaner berry-fruit notes with airing. A full grabby palate is a bit rough and awkward, while roasted berry, plum and oak flavors finish minty and resiny.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"A solid Cab, with pleasant blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors wrapped into rich, gentle tannins. Clean and fancy. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"White flowers and wild anise give this a crisp, tangy quality, the fruit balanced and refined, showing up as Asian pear and Meyer lemon. The voluptuous finish adds depth without overbearing power.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Selected from a portion of the family vineyard, this soft wine, named after the owner of the estate, is gently ripe but with the potential to bring out even more fruitiness. The aftertaste is crisp and ripe.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Here's a big, lusty Zinfandel. It leaves little to the imagination, swamping the mouth with sweetly ripe raspberries, cherries and mocha. Perfect for drinking with a great cheeseburger or plate of lasagna.",US-California-Zinfandel
"The old vine designation, though unregulated, is usually reserved for plantings at least a quarter century old. Though the first sniff suggests a wine that has been over-oaked, such is not the case. It has the concentration and fruit power—layers of citrus and stone fruit flavors—along with the depth and texture that older vines bring, to more than support the generous new oak.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Sharp acidity makes this young wine a bit tart now. It has solid flavors of cherries, raspberries, bacon and smoky sandalwood, and is dry and silky. Decant for a few hours, or better yet, give it a year or two in the cellar.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Red cherry fruit, with edges of white pepper, plays charmingly on both the nose and palate. The svelte figure of the wine belies its depth: this has subtle, Burgundian virtues and earthy undertones that provoke stimulating conversation and thought. An ideal accompaniment for subtle, nuanced dishes or a really good book.",Austria-Leithaberg-Blaufränkisch
"This wine comes from a large family-owned estate on the island's east coast. It's loaded with bright fruit, crisp acidity and a rounded, ripe red berry-inflected aftertaste. Drink now.",France-France Other-Rosé
"This is tart and briary in the mouth, with less-than-ripe tannins and fruit. This has a decent blackberry flavor. Drink up.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a finely made wine, fresh and crisp. It is dry but with a soft texture that turns it into a wine that's both good with food and as an apéritif. The aftertaste is crisp and still fruity.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Rosé
"The name is apropos, for this is a big, fleshy wine, almost like one of those Aussie Shirazes in jammy fruit, although it's Cabernet all the way with blackberries and currants. With fine tannins and a smooth finish, it shows quite a bit of sophistication.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"From start to finish, there's so much going on with Lamoreaux Landing's Yellow Dog. Honey and orange blossom aromas are laced with a whisper of musk. The bright lemon-lime sweetness is balanced elegantly with a distinct minerality evocative of smoke, slate and stone, and a bracing acidity that drives a lingering finish.",US-New York-Riesling
"Initially this smells closed, charred, oaky and minty more than lush and fruity, but with airing things get reversed. The palate is rich, ripped and juicy, with excellent structure. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, spice and reedy tobacco finish dry, powerful and with a strong note of licorice. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain-Mencía
"This wine consists of all five red Bordeaux varieties, with 54% Cabernet Sauvignon making up the majority. A juicy front palate of cassis and blueberry leads to leathery, dusty tannins and notes of graphite, cedar and tea.",US-California-Meritage
"Rough and awkward, with some cherry flavors and greener ones of stems and herbs. Drinks dry and fairly tannic. Perfectly acceptable as an inexpensive chugger.",US-California-Merlot
"Smooth, wood-aged wine that has well-balanced red fruit flavors to go with the ripe tannins. A touch of mint reveals the new wood in the aging that has produced a fine, rich wine that will age well over the next five years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
The wine is ripe with its stalky black-currant fruit filled out and given a rich character by the warm red-plum juiciness. It is still young and its youthful tannins still prominent. Give this until 2019 before drinking.,France-Provence-Provence red blend
"This blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah offers a fragrance of black fruit and Mediterranean herbs. The palate is a bit restrained but reveals black cherry, licorice and black pepper along with notes of espresso and toasted oak.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this offers aromas of forest floor, tilled soil, violet, woodland berry and a whiff of leather. The structured but elegant palate doles out juicy black cherry, licorice, tobacco and ground pepper alongside velvety tannins. It's already delicious but hold for more complexity. Drink 2016–2026.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"What a fine Chardonnay. Made in a bone dry, minerally style, it may not have the immediately seductive quality of some Chards, but it does show a Chablis-like elegance that makes it a natural for food pairing, with its fine citrus and steel tang and mouthwatering acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Aromas come off as quite green, with notes of jalapeño pepper and garden herb mixed with cherry and vanilla. The palate brings broad cherry flavors. It provides appeal but the aromas and flavors seem a bit disconnected and the greenness proves distracting.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Extravagantly rich, this is dense and supersweet initially, just balanced with acidity. The botrytis dryness is really not here at this stage, but with its elegant creamy texture, wood flavors still very present. This is still at the very beginning of its development.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Dark blue-purple in color, this is a breezy, giving wine on the palate, fresh and light in blueberry preserves and soft layers of integrated oak and tannin. It finishes smooth and with a hint of chocolate.",US-California-Malbec
"While there is a youthful stalky element to this wine, it also has plenty of ripe black-cherry fruit. That suggests a warm ripe future as the tannins soften. Drink this potentially rich, spicy wine from 2019.",France-Loire Valley-Pinot Noir
"Made entirely with Nebbiolo grown in the mountain vineyards of northeastern Italy, this opens with enticing aromas of wild rose, bright berry and Alpine herbs. The polished, structured palate delivers wild cherry, crushed raspberry, exotic spice, vanilla bean and toasted oak. Firm, silky tannins provide structure. Drink through 2024.",Italy-Lombardy-Nebbiolo
"Cherry and watermelon aromas are fair and easy, while raspberry and plum-skin flavors finish pithy and citrusy.",Spain-Northern Spain-Rosado
"A fine Chardonnay for the price. Soft and buttery upon entry, it shows good balance in the midpalate, with the butter blended with fresh apple and lime, and set against enough juicy acidity to give it definition.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Generous flavors of red and black cherry, and a nice, firm coating of fine tannins make this full-bodied wine good and substantive. Those dark fruit flavors are fairly deep and concentrated, and linger on the finish.",US-California-Merlot
"The aromas are up front, with barrel notes of char, vanilla, coconut and baking spice followed by cigar box. The wood really shows through on the palate as well, with the tannins bringing a strong sense of astringency.",US-Washington-Tempranillo
The nose of Concord grapes is immediately appealing and leads to notes of overripe raspberries. Substantial residual sugar in combination with medium acidity render this a good for pool-side sipping or with paté.,France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Pervaded by lively, friendly, zippy freshness, this easy-drinking Riesling comes with a sprightly, fruity balance on its dry palate that is made all the more summery by the faintest amount of fizz.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Riesling
"This is a lovely Syrah. It has a medium-bodied lightness that feels velvety in the mouth, and is packed with sweet blackberry, plum, mocha and bacon flavors, accented with smoky sandalwood. Nice to drink now, and will gain traction over the next 6–8 years.",US-California-Syrah
"Here's a fruit-forward Pinot Noir. It brims in raspberry, cherry and cola flavors, elaborated with the sweet vanillins and caramel of oak barrels, and is brightened with typical Highlands acidity. Seems at its best now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine presents oxidized aromas of caramel and butterscotch, followed by apricot and pear notes. A touch of bitterness appears on the finish.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"Fragrant and lush with floral/citrus aromas, this stainless-fermented Chardonnay is inviting and seductive. Brilliant, bright fruit anchors a wine that is tense and dense and vividly thrilling. The acids are natural and flavors seamlessly run from lemon/lime to pineapple to orange, and keep on keeping on, with fresh, water-washed rock in the finish.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Pure and friendly notes of ripe Bosc pear entice the nose. The palate shows freshness and generosity in equal measure. Balance and zip makes this wine moreish and expressive, while the pithy, citric core lends structure and balance.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"Here's a very attractive and seductive Barolo with chiseled mineral tones that really help the wine stand out in a crowd. Layers of graphite and slate give purity, linearity and clarity to this austere and elegant expression. Earthy tones, as well as forest berry flavors, appear on the long finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"Another 2010 Pinot marred by vegetal aromas. The chilly vintage took its toll, robbing the raspberries and cherries of their natural richness. Still, it's pretty good once you give it some airing.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Big, powerful wine that is restrained by its ripe, dusty tannins. It is concentrated, with an almost Port-like texture, a result of the open lagars in which it is fermented. The fruit is likely to be rich and opulent as the tannins move into balance.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"A soft, luscious Zin, dry and firm in tannins, with forward flavors of raspberries, cherries, almond biscotti, mocha and dusty spices. Drink now.",US-California-Zinfandel

"Spice, cherry liqueur, dark fruit, leather and moist tobacco comprise the bouquet. Structured and firm, the wine delivers a clean, focused feel.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Not exactly a world-class white wine but at least it smells and tastes like Chardonnay. The nose offers some butter and lemon curd, while the palate is jumpy and tastes like a mix of pear, apple and spice. A fresh, young wine that should be drunk soon.",Argentina-Other-Chardonnay
"The inviting nose of this mature red blends berry, vanillin oak, sweet cream, wood and tobacco. But the wine never fully delivers on the front-end promise, as oak sits heavily on the berry-plum fruit, giving it a smooth but rather leaden feel. More woody tannins show on the modest finish. Probably would have shown more positively three years ago. —M.M.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend

"A delicious Talley Rincon, showing the class of this vineyard. Maybe not the best vintage, lacking some elegance, but the wine is ultrarich and full-bodied, with massive raspberry and cherry flavors. Drink soon.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Your first and last impression of this wine is how tannic it is. It's almost old fashioned in this respect, numbing the mouth with hard astringency. However the flavors are ripe and intense, suggesting heady crême de cassis liqueur, and the overall feeling is dry and balanced. If you're a gambler, give it 10 years and see what happens.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The Grandlieu lake, to the west of the Sèvre et Maine Muscadet vineyards, produces softer wines, like this. This wine is ripe, with hints of toast and vanilla as well as fresh and crisp apple acidity.

"This unfiltered, reserve-level wine ripened nicely in 2013, yielding a silky, high-toned palate with plum, berry and cherry fruits.

"Harvested late but not sweet, this decadently rich and fruity wine pairs well with cheese or an equally opulent dish such as osso bucco or red wine risotto.

"Dense, smoky aromas of well-toasted oak are lactic on impact, with blackberry and cassis scents in support. This is woody, resiny and tannic on the palate, which makes it rough now but bodes well for down the line. Charred, toasty oak and herbal blackberry flavors finish minty, with a speck of creosote. Drink through 2020.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley-Syrah

There's a riot of fruit flavors, from citrus to tangerine to Macintosh apple and spiced pear, with a slightly saline finish.",US-Washington-Rhône-style White Blend
"Thinner and more traditional in style and appearance, this Riserva has nice balsam- and almond-like intensity. These qualities make it a perfect companion to pork with glazed onions or vegetables au gratin. It's a bit thorny and nervous in the mouth—qualities that probably won't be appreciated by those seeking soft, dense flavors.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese

"Except for being just a bit linear, this is a really good Cabernet for the price. It offers rich blackberry, black currant liqueur, anise and cedar flavors that are wrapped into firm tannins. The balance is really impressive. It's throwing some sediment already, so decant it.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Very dark purple in the glass, this bottling shows leathery red cherry, subtle nutmeg and ginger spice, a touch of baked soil and stronger caramel notes on the nose. Rich black cherry meets with vanilla on the palate, which is slathered with a strong simmering acidity that's refreshing although almost too potent.",US-California-Mourvèdre

"This world-class blend of 52% Cabernet Franc, 20% Malbec, 13% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot is concentrated, structured and powerful, with the promise of a long life ahead. Earthy, herbal streaks of cigar box, licorice root, char and minty fynbos frame the lush fruit core of muddled boysenberry, black raspberry, plum and currant. The palate is bold and assertively flavored, with good evolution from jammy black fruit to earthy spice and finally leather and toast on the finish. Drink 2018–2024.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Red Blend
"This nose features much more nuance than a typical Sauvignon Blanc, with chalky minerality, bright stone fruit and barely ripe tropicality. It's a bit tight at first on the palate, but poached pear and papaya flavors emerge, then open to candied guava in the midpalate.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Right now, although the nose is closed, exposure to air reveals the purity of lemon oil on a taut and tight palate still singing with yeasty notes. This is in its very infancy and promises to open up beautifully with its straight, soaring backbone of freshness. Underneath all the tightly curled layers of citrus peel slumbers a salty stoniness that signals ageability; the long, lemony finish corroborates this. How utterly lip-smacking. Drink 2020–2030",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"Pale salmon and orange in color, this is a wine that brings together almonds, red fruits and a yeasty character. It is full-bodied, the ripe fruits like fruit candy, a bitter edge never far away.",France-Loire Valley-Cabernet Franc

"Fast becoming one of the world's top luxury cuvées, this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Syrah is a complex amalgam of dry, classy fruit, herbal notes, smoked meat, black pepper and baking spices. Its calling card is its perfect body weight. It isn't heavy or jammy, but it manages to offer tons of stuffing and a graceful finish loaded with the essences of cola, coffee and chocolate. If possible, it should be cellared for several more years.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"At first blush, this comes across scratchy and raw on the nose. In the mouth, it's more jammy than lively, with saturated, reduced flavors of blueberry and prune. On the finish, this feels big for its britches and tastes mildly bitter.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo

"San Polo offers a very unique interpretation of the 2008 vintage. Rather than focus on bold cherry and leather aromas, this Brunello shows tones of peppermint, chopped herb, cola, ginger and forest berry. The mouthfeel is compact, tight and shows some astringency that will soften with time.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"This is a young, structured wine that needs some time to develop. It has stalky tannins over black-currant fruits that give the wine both structure and freshness. With its dusty texture and spice flavors from the wood aging, it will be best drunk from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Here's a wine that seems to have experienced a bit of a transformation in past vintages. The 2008 expression is lighter and crisper than in the past, but the price tag has also been lowered considerably.

This is a full-bodied, ripe-textured wine worth a look. Drink now–2025.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This Cabernet Franc blend opens with herbal oaky aromas of coffee and red fruits. The palate feels tartaric and shocking, with heavy extraction and an overall wiry feel. Jacked-up berry flavors come with more than enough oak, while this is steady but not finessed or elegant on the finish. Drink through 2021.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Medicinal berry aromas are outweighed by a strong blast of clove. While this feels wide and chunky, it's also acidic. Following the nose, this tastes heavily of clove along with plum, currant and raspberry. On the finish, there's no shedding that dominant oak-based clove character.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon

Drink now, or better from 2017.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Aromas of mulled black fruits, vanilla, tobacco, orange peel and earth are a touch jumbled, but compartmentalized—this smells nice. Wiry and fresh in feel, but with a slightly hollow midsection, this tastes peppery, oaky and like cherry and black plum. A toasty finish with snappy acidity solidifies this medium-weight La Mancha Tempranillo. Drink through 2019.",Spain-Central Spain-Tempranillo

The wine is classic Russian River, showing full-throttle berry-cherry fruit, balanced with good acidity, while maintaining a delicate mouthfeel. It's complex enough to warrant repeated sipping.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Dark berry and black cooking spice aromas lead the nose on this straightforward red. The dense, simple palate offers blackberry jam and a note of anise alongside compact, rounded tannins. Drink through 2016.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"One of the small Sauvignon Blanc areas close to Sancerre, Menetou-Salon produces a light, crisp and herbal style of wine. This fits that bill well, its freshness contained within the flavors of hedgerow fruits and tangy acids.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Intensely rich, this wine is packed with flavors of spice, gingerbread and lychees. It has a full, rounded character with an intense spiciness that is anchored to a more structured texture. Drink now and until 2018.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"This aromatic wine carries notes of movie theater buttered popcorn, peach and lees. It's full bodied with buttery stone fruit flavors that show a considerable amount of creaminess and elegance.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"With an extra-deep color and smoky-sweet oak aromas, this wine doesn't taste like its peer group, but seems to be going for commercial appeal as a spiced-up generic red. It's full bodied, almost thick in texture and firmly tannic.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Produced from organically grown grapes, the wine is fruity, lightly structured and developing quickly. It has generous black currants and black plums that are already attractive and crisp. There is a firm back drop of tannins. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This light-bodied red brings freshly sawed wood aromas over spiced cranberry and cherry. Driven by tart red fruit, the palate is lively with driving acidity, ending in a delicate, peppered finish.",US-Virginia-Cabernet Franc
"Pleasant floral aromas and sunny fruit-bowl flavors meet light buttery, earthy touches in this rather light-bodied wine. This shows nice complexity on the palate, with pear, peach and apple flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"So ripe and fruity, it's almost too much of a good thing. Detonates on the palate with blasts of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, cola and cinnamon spice. Feels too soft, and could use greater dryness and structure, but it's a good BBQ sipper.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This smells gritty, much like burnt leather. After that, stalky, herbal aromas rise up. In the mouth, it's grabby and tannic but not overly hard, with earthy, roasted flavors of leathery berry and salt. A savory tasting finish with modest fruit is lengthy and feels solid.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Protos is a venerable RDD label that doesn't try to do too much with its wines. This youngster is tight, polished and deep, with rich, oily aromas and creamy, saturated blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors. With spice and depth, it shows how good the 2005 vintage is, even for a big-production joven like this.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Notes of earth and mirabelle combine with lemony zest to make a refreshing, enticing opening. The palate focuses on the citrus hit with just a touch of yeasty savor and pepper around the edges. The finish is wonderfully clean and the lightness of the palate belies its depth.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"This rich Cabernet drinks beautifully now for its ripe, forward blackberry, cassis liqueur and oak flavors. It's smooth and dry, with classic Napa balance. Good as it is, it should develop in the bottle over the next decade.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Foamy mousse and soft, fizzy perlage characterize this delicate offering. It could pair with fruit salad or cream-based desserts, thanks to its delicate citrus and peach flavors.",Italy-Piedmont-Moscato
"Coffee, beef stock, blackberry and graphite aromas require patience to process. A lively, ringing palate is jammy at its essence. Dark, toasty flavors of blackberry and blueberry are mildly green and herbal. It feels rubbery on a tannic finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Blended with 18% Merlot, this shows a mix of black cherry, fig and sweet prune fruit flavors. Some smoke from barrel aging comes in, and it's good right up to the finish, which has a gluey undertone.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"Pretty fragrances and freshness characterize this popular Pinot Grigio with aromas of stone fruit, acacia flower and honeydew melon. It's a simple, easy wine with a thin consistency but those floral aromas help make it stand out in a crowd.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Though the winery claims just 10% new French oak was used, the impact of smoky, charred wood is clear. Some bright, tart raspberry fruit is at the core. The tannins carry flavors of coffee grounds and dark chocolate.",US-Oregon-Malbec
"Having spent five years en tirage, this impressive bottling is dry and minerally, with notes of wet stone and white flowers. Light and lively, it offers moderate acidity that allows the wine to build tension and texture on the palate, finishing in green apple.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
Fresh and inviting with assertive notes of pineapple and sweet citrus backed by fleshy pear and melon accents on the nose and mouth. The palate offers zippy acidity with a clean lift to the finish. Drink now.,South Africa-Western Cape-Chardonnay
"Quite dark for the grape, this wine from the Carpinteria estate of Rick and Penny Morales shows red plums, pepper, dried oregano, cooked beef, hoisin and mint chocolate on the lush nose. Though the wine is five years old, the tannins remain quite present on the palate, where bay leaf, black cardamom, espresso, cedar and exotic spices give depth to the black plum and dark strawberry fruit.",US-California-Grenache
"This racy white opens with scents of cut grass, tomato vine and grapefruit. The zippy, rather lean palate offers citrus, pineapple and a mineral note alongside bracing acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"Pale salmon colored, this is a fairly aromatic rosé with notes of strawberry, bubblegum and cherry. It's off-dry, leaning toward medium sweet and needs a bit more acidity to stand it up.",US-Washington-Rosé
"Made from 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this blend is firm in tannins and stuffed with lovely flavors of blackberry, cherry, currant, grilled meat, pepper, exotic spice and cedar. Brisk acidity and bold tannins suggest pairing with rich, fatty meats and cheeses now and over the next five years.",US-California-Red Blend
"This Peyronie family cru bourgeois estate is one of the rare properties in Pauillac that is not a classified growth. That alone makes it a good value. The wine comes from vines close to Pichon Baron in the south of the appellation. This juicy black-currant flavored wine is still very young, full of its tannins and dark character. With its structure and acidity, the wine will age well. Drink from 2022.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Waterstone's non-reserve Cabernet is often quite good and the '05 is just about their best ever. It's a fine wine, dry and full-bodied and rich in black currants, smoky oak and spices. Drink now and for the next several years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of pomegranate, black fruit, herb and barrel spice lead to rich seamless palate-coating dark-fruit flavors. It's hedonistic but retains a sense of balance along with an unabashed deliciousness.",US-Washington-Syrah
"With aromas of black fruit, earth, rubber and tomato leaf, this fits the bill for Carmenère. The palate is snappy and lively, with drying, rubbery tannins. Flavors of zesty plum and berry are herbal and spicy, and it finishes with vitality and a scouring scrub of acidity and tannic clamp.",Chile-Curicó Valley-Carmenère
"Like so many producers and négociants, Bouchard Père has a slice of the action in this famed Grand Cru. Its interpretation is generous, going for the inherent richness from the terroir. This is a magnificently ripe wine, definitely opulent, with the generous wood enhancing the very ripe fruit. In all this splendor, it is good to find a delicious edge of acidity.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"With brisk acidity, a bone-dry finish and some dusty tannins, this is an interesting Pinot Noir, with a silky texture and cherry jam, pomegranate and cranberry flavors that are ready to drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"This smooth, wood-aged wine is richly tannic and packed with new wood flavors. Ripe red berries offer fruitiness and acidity. It has a fine depth of flavor and density, making it likely to age for several years, at least four. Screwcap.",Austria-Burgenland-Austrian Red Blend
"Minty and sheer on the nose, and that's a prime indicator of what's to come, namely high-toned, lean fruit flavors and an abundance of scouring, protruding acidity. Some oak lingers to soften things, but overall this is a sharp, underdeveloped style of Cabernet.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Vanilla, clove, allspice, dried ginger and soy are laced into black-plum sauce on the nose of this densely layered wine. The palate is even-handed, with tight boysenberry spiced up by caramel and bitter espresso notes.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"This is every bit the equal of, if not even a bit better than, the outstanding 2005 Novelty Hill Sauvignon Blanc. Here is the same mix of racy, bracing tropical and stone fruit flavors, nicely matched to toasty flavors of almonds and biscuits. Elegant, detailed and ripe, yet clearly varietal, this is a beautiful, seductive example of barrel-fermented Washington Sauvignon Blanc.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"Fruit from the oldest blocks in this pioneering vineyard is sourced here. It's bright, spicy and focused, with forward citrus-scented Bing cherry flavors. The concentration and length are outstanding, with just the lightest suggestion of green herbs rounding out the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A jolly, fruity wine—very Beaujolais—with a touch of bananas to go with cherry flavors and soft tannins. Ready to drink, and best served slightly chilled.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This is a soft, ductile blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Touriga Nacional. It bears dusty tannins that add subtle texture, and a turmeric flavor adds an exotic edge to the palate.",US-Virginia-Red Blend
"This is a lifted and fresh Chardonnay with vibrant notes of red apple flesh, hard Anjou pear and fresh orange essence. A touch of toast and nectarine pit unfold in the mouth, with a soft suggestion of sweet spice that lingers on the back of the palate through the long finish.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Chardonnay
"From vines to the east of Saint-Émilion city, this wine is structured and firm. It will take time for the black fruit to come through, so drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A thin wine, with a quick strawberry/cranberry entry, that resolves into an acidic, mouth-puckering, generic red. It's fine for chilling and drinking as a simple café red, but not priced for that market.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Sort of gaseous and touchy on the nose, with bramble and sweaty leather rising up once the bouquet opens. The palate offers a quick flash of berry fruit but nothing backing that up, and the finish is gone in seconds. Basically this is a light-bodied quaffer that seeks not to offend.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This red, made from 61% Cab Sauv, 30% Shiraz and 9% Merlot, offers attractive floral aromas of lavender, baby powder and light menthol (like a Thin Mint) to the soft but ripe dark fruit notes. The mouth offers more spice and weight than the aromas would suggest, with a firm but approachable structure and cigar box spice on the medium-length finish.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Red Blend
"This semi-sweet wine is dark in color, full bodied, peppery in aroma, and full of berry flavors on the palate. A thick texture coats the mouth with jammy sensations that slowly recede on the finish.",US-California-Red Blend
"This stunning wine offers strawberry-shortcake goodness, with a hint of cream. It's pretty, fine-tuned and quite young, with suggestions of rhubarb and cranberry. Give it plenty of breathing time and enjoy it now through 2025.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Cool weather in 2012 kept acid levels high, something that comes across clearly in this wine. The fruit is bright and crisp—more like pie cherry than Bing or Rainier—and turns tart on the finish. Because of this, it could be one of those Pinot Noirs that pairs well with salmon.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"This is a ripe, fruity wine that has both tannins and generous of black fruits. The combination has produced a rounded, fruity wine that is sustained by its structure although it is very ready to drink now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Perhaps this wine just needs some additional cellaring, as the finish is long enough to suggest promise, but this particular bottle was in a cranky stage, showing lots of toasted oak and coffee-like aromas and tart acidity. The tannins seem ripe, so it's worth trying again in a year or two.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Herbal berry and plum aromas are earthy at best and a touch green at worst. Salty plum and berry flavors are tomatoey and chunky, while drying tannins and herbal flavors drive the finish.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Merlot
"This is a simple, one-dimensional Chianti Classico that does a good job of doling out its easy aromas of cherry and blueberry. Pair it with pizza or pasta and meat sauce.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Fresh, dry red-fruit aromas lead the charge on this tasty but simple Rioja that feels crisp, healthy and balanced. Flavors of plum, raspberry and herbs finish mild.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"From the winery's Bordeaux study series, this Merlot-based blend shows roast beef, smoke, lilac, violet, lavender and shy black-cherry fruit on the nose. There's more fruit on the palate, with blackberry paste. However, the rigid tannins don't open up easily. Notes of crushed volcanic rock, espresso, dried herbs and leather are subtle.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"While the wine is full bodied and rich, it is also deliciously fresh and with lively fruitiness. There is great acidity here, a bright layer of red currant fruits and wild strawberries, making it a good food rosé.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This candied rosé is a blend of Touriga Nacional and Syrah. Full of soft red berry fruits with only light acidity, it is off-dry to taste. A touch of pepper at the end is less attractive.",Portugal-Tejo-Rosé
"Hard tannins and overripe raisiny flavors compromise this wine. Inky black in color, it's an intense, big-boned wine that's better enjoyed with a meal.",US-California-Petit Verdot
"A very good Merlot, representing a huge increase in quality over the 2008, and a return to the charms of the 2007. It's ripe and tasty in fruit, currants and sweet oak, and earns extra points for the fine structure. Ready now.",US-California-Merlot
"This is the winning Mourvèdre of the vintage for Ryan Pease, one of the few winemakers to do multiple bottlings of the Rhône varietal. Exotic olallieberies, black peppercorns, vanilla cookies, nutmeg and black rocks show on the nose, while the palate delivers tighter boysenberries, cracked pepper, Sichuan peppercorns, wet gravel and crushed asphalt. This one's built to last.",US-California-Mourvèdre
"It's safe to say that Gianfranco Soldera's style is only appreciated and understood by Brunello purists. The wines are as thorny and complex as the argumentative, cantankerous man who makes them. For one, this wine has big volatility but the magic here is that those pungent direct aromas translate into bright aromatic vibrancy and buoyancy. In fact, its intensity and the careful balance between acidity and structure is unmatched.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Earthy notes are mixed into the perfume of fleshy, ripe apricots, edged with baking spice. The palate plays on the same register of ripe stone fruit tempered by spice, earth and dried orange peel. This is dry and slender but incisive and concentrated—very grown up and appealing in a restrained, elegant fashion. The finish is clean and long. Drink 2016–2025.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"This Cabernet gets the job done with its blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. It's nice and dry, and it will wash down a hamburger.",US-California-Red Blend
"This is aged in oak, but the vessels are large casks, or foudres, so the impact isn't that noticeable. The wine is meaty and savory on the nose, but the palate shows more herb-garrigue flavors and superripe cherry fruit. Drink now–2017.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"A full, ripe and generous Tempranillo, with rich aromas of prune and blackberry offset by balsamic notes and tobacco. It feels lush and smooth, with concentrated flavors of roasted berry, coffee, chocolate and tobacco. Huge and lasting on the finish, has subtle tannins and complexity. Drink now through 2016.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"With a slight prickle on the tongue, this off-dry wine is crisp, fruity, packed with citrus and with fine acidity. It is zesty, tangy and a pleasure to drink with its bright flavors and texture. Drink now.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White
"Rusty in color, this has a baked fruit aromas suggestive of raisin, cherry and plum. It's thick, but it maintains freshness due to the solid acidity. This feels heavy, with robust flavors of roasted plum and blackberry, but the finish isn't cloying.",Spain-Central Spain-Garnacha
"Softly sweet, this brings bright Fuji apple and Anjou pear aromas and flavors. It charms with fresh fruit character and stays away from the dry balance of more serious wines.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Smells oceanic, like sea foam, field greens and flowers. Feels lean, quick and tart, with fresh red fruit flavors followed by acidity and dry, peppery spice. Lightly oaky and tangy on the finish.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir
"Grapefruit zest, yeast and freshly cut kitchen herbs add to the enticing flavor of green pear on this light-footed, energetic wine. There is lots of drive, joy and ease. Yet there's nothing facile here—just the most nimble expression of clean-cut, refreshing Grüner.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"As reserved on the nose as on the palate, this Rosso shows faint dried black cherry and licorice notes. The subtlest hint of thyme marks the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Smooth and creamy, this is a rounded wine that's soft in texture. A good bite of lemon juice acidity adds balance and attractive fruitiness. Finishes very clean and fragrant. Screwcap.",Austria-Weinviertel-Grüner Veltliner
"This is a complex young wine, made in the white Bordeaux style. It has been barrel fermented and aged on the lees. Marked by crisp, mouthwatering acidity, it shows a grassy, hay quality that dries out the citrus fruit and apple fruit, giving the wine a bone-dry feel. Very fine and near the top of Napa Valley Sauvignon Blancs.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"The wine is ripe and very full in the mouth. With tannins that are enveloped by rich black fruit, it is already drinkable. Dense plum and strawberry flavors are generous, with a touch of pepper. It is ready to drink.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This lighter-style Cab offers berry-fruit and black-tea flavors, and nut and oak finish. It's an easy quaffer, but nothing to mull over.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This attractive, juicy wine is full of red fruit. It has strawberry and crisp red currant flavors as well as fine acidity. The result is a wine with good balance, richness, spice and tannins. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"What an aromatic tease: there is elderflower, tart passion fruit and lots of fruity exuberance. The interplay between lip-smacking tartness and almost frivolous fruit makes for liveliness, excitement and joy. Serve this when you want your guests to sparkle as much as the wine. Autolytic flavors are subtle but provide a creamy finish.",England-England-Sparkling Blend
"Aromas of flowers, graphite, licorice and high-toned herbs are followed by red- and black-fruit flavors that coat the palate from end to end. This has an extremely high yum factor that demands another sip.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"This blend of Grecanico and Viognier offers a generous bouquet with exotic fruit, pineapple, white flower and dusty talc powder. The wine also shows creamy thickness in the mouth.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"It's all about ripe, jammy blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate in this soft, tannic Cabernet. The alcohol is noticeable for the heat it gives, and the finish is rich with glycerols. Drink soon.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe, juicy pear scents make for an inviting nose. The wine's concentrated palate presents ample citrus with those pear notes, as well as spicy grapefruit zestiness. This is lovely, dry, refreshing and focused.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"Crisp green apple and Conference pear scents vie for attention in this wine. The slender palate adds a backdrop of yeasty savoriness yet remains sprightly and zippy. Riper fruit adds a more sonorous tone as it finishes, feeling full of citric verve and totally appetizing.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"Very dry, this wine is firmly tannic, with the potential for great swathes of juicy fruitiness. It's currently developing beyond its youthful dryness and just beginning to reveal black-currant fruit. Give it another 2–3 years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Made from 50% Grenache, 30% Cinsault and 20% Syrah, this is a vibrant, floral rosé, offering upfront aromas of iris, lavender and laurel that complement the raspberry and strawberry-hull core. The fruity palate is bright and refreshing, with ample acidity and just a hint of orange blossom on the finish.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rosé
"Subtle notions of ripe peach circle above a compact, bundled palate of peach and spice: perhaps vanilla, perhaps pepper. The distinct but subtle sweetness on the palate is countered by a firm, focussed freshness which in turn contrasts with pleasant warmth. The dramatic palate draws you so far into its quicksand-like depth that you almost forget to notice the more ethereal, scented clouds of peach. Pure joy.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Fragrant and sleek, this opens with scents of blue flower, pressed powder, perfumed berry and chopped herb. The balanced, full-bodied palate delivers licorice, ripe black cherry, clove and tobacco while firm, velvety tannins lend structure and finesse.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Hard tannins currently lock this wine down. Although it's astringent, it's very polished and complex. Made from Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, in that order, it's marked by black cherry, red currant and cedar flavors, and finishes totally dry. The vineyard is in the cool Oak Knoll District, which helps explain the acidity and tightness. Difficult to predict if it will age.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A pale rosé in color, this light and fruity wine has a fresh raspberry flavor, with a zingy texture that gives attractive acidity. It's light and creamy, hinting at yeastiness on the finish.",France-Alsace-Pinot Noir
This is a new wine designed to be a “grown-up rosé” from the Cronk family who moved from London to Provence in 2009. It is a ripe fruity and rich blend of Grenache and Syrah. Weight as well as contrasting acidity give a structured character that balances well with the intense fruitiness. Drink the wine from late 2017.,France-Provence-Rosé
"Bricco Medica Roero offers beautiful aromas of blue flowers, tangerine skin and cassis berry. It's a tad softer than other expressions although the finish is tannic and drying.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Obviously wood-aged, with a smoky toast flavor, this is a wine that shows the power of Saint-Estèphe tannins in full force. At the same time, there is a blackberry character that adds richness and juiciness, which cuts through the dry core. Age for at least 7–8 years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"With his focus on Cabernet Sauvignon, Etienne Le Riche is able bring deep knowledge to this varietal. His skill shows in this wine which manages to combine great fruitiness with all the right tannins, dryness, along with just a touch of austerity. The bramble fruit flavors give the wine a lift just when it needs it.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Much like the previous vintage of La Violeta, this is a fabulous Malbec with depth, density and power to spare. The bouquet yields marzipan, cola, fine leather, char and rich berry aromas. That sets up a palate with impeccable structure and huge flavors of beef jerky, mocha, black fruits and spice. The finish is massive and loaded, with licorice and mocha flavors. Drink now–2018. Only 100 cases made, with 50 imported into the U.S.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Rich aromas of meaty charcuterie provide a compelling reason to investigate this wine further, a largely varietal undertaking with 5% Merlot, aged two years in 80% new French oak. Chalky, dusty tannins add a smokiness and medium weight, before finishing with a touch of dried herb.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A heavy frosting of sweet oak aroma and flavor covers this otherwise soft and unassuming wine. It smells like custard, tastes like pastry and has a butterscotch note on the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"From a biodynamically-farmed vineyard, this frames its cola and black cherry flavors with gravelly minerality The dark, earthy components come up through the finish, and the tannins have a slightly herbal edge from 10% whole-cluster fermentation.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Jasmine, honeysuckle, apricot and citrus aromas open. The bright, savory palate presents juicy pineapple, ripe pear, white peach and lemon zest framed in tangy acidity. Hints of Mediterranean herb add depth while a mineral note energizes the finish.",Italy-Southern Italy-Falanghina
"Rounded, almost luscious fruitiness is at the core of this easy wine. Lychee, lemon, peach and apricot scented with rose petals on a rich palate close with orange peel freshness.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"The nose screams Viognier, with aromas of Juicy Fruit gum, white flowers and powdered candy necklace. A peaches-and-cream palate feels lush and viscous, yet the acid manages to keep things lively through the fuzzy-textured finish.",US-Virginia-Viognier
"Much like this producer's Pinot Blanc, this wine offers apple and pear fruit, with just a little more flesh and a hint of cinnamon.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"With fine, dusty tannins, this rich and juicy wine wears its fruit on its sleeve, all black plums and blackberry flavors. The acidity of the year is almost sweet with the fresh ripeness of the fruit. It is developing well, showing a medium-term future. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Engaging aromas of wild berry, new leather, tilled earth and clove slowly take shape in the glass. On the savory medium-bodied palate, bracing but noble tannins underscore a black-cherry core while notes of black olive, anise, Mediterranean herb and earthy game provide the backdrop. It's loaded with personality. Drink 2018–2028.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"This barrel selection has long been Signorello's best Chardonnay, and it still is. It elevates Napa Valley, not the most natural home to Chardonnay, to its finest expression. Earthy but complex, it has intricate citrus, tropical fruit and oak flavors, as well as a firm minerality. Drink now.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Lightly perfumed with hawthorn flower and orchard fruit aromas, this linear white offers flavors of green apple, lime and tangerine zest. Crisp acidity supports the palate while a mineral note closes the tangy finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio

"Ripe, opulent blackberry, cherry, butterscotch and vanilla bean flavors mark this soft wine. You can drink it now with everyday fare like beef tacos and cheeseburgers.",US-California-Red Blend
"Marked by aggressive acidity and some dusty tannins, this Pinot is not showing well now. It's just too hard and tart. But the flavors are enormously ripe, and the finish is dry and silky and long. It all suggests cellaring to let the cherries, black raspberries and Dr. Pepper cola emerge from their tomb. Better after 2011.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The nose on this Malbec is blue-green, meaning it deals both blueberry and boysenberry but also alfalfa and minty green aromas. The palate feels big and generous, with nice acidity and flavors of pastry, jammy blackberry, molasses and spice. Amid the layered finish, you'll find baked black-fruit flavors and light green notes.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Sweet with brown-sugar aromas, but the nose lacks more than that. Citrus and other sweet aromas are solid but common, while the feel is good and the finish brings back brown sugar and mocha. Standard; not designed for complexity.",Spain-Andalucia-Sherry
"Pretty dark and full-bodied for a rosé, and too extracted and heavy in cherry-berry flavors to be considered elegant. It's almost a red wine you could drink at room temperature.",US-California-Rosé
"This is the lightest of the Soutiran Champagnes, softly textured, attractively ripe and delicious as an apéritif. It is fruity, with fresh pear and spiced apple flavors, finishing with sweet acidity.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Bright red currant is complemented by dark, brooding black fruit tones in this complex, nuanced and grippy wine, young and showy in its mountain genetics. Forest floor, mint, cedar and graphite fleck the fruit, with complexity knocking on the door.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Any vintage Champagne from 2004 will still be young, and this is no exception. But with the fresh, light Deutz style, this is already offering delicious green plum and citrus flavors, supplemented by creamy acidity. The finish is soft, light, creamy.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"There is a tantalizing hint of perfume in this 85% Sauvignon Blanc and 15% Muscadelle blend that makes the wine both ripe and textured. With a touch of pepper as well as crisp apple, the wine is rich and ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This entry-level look at the family vineyard that overlooks Ballard Canyon and beyond brings scents of graphite, pepper, blackberry and dried, slightly dank herbs. It's tight and tart at first on the palate, with skins of black cherry and plum unwinding into pencil shavings, oregano, wood and emergent mushrooms. The tannins are best for drinking 2017–2025.",US-California-Syrah
"Rich, wood-aged wine that shows ripe blackberry juice flavors to balance the firm tannins. It has good depth, structure and weight, a ripe and good value Bordeaux.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Crisp in acidity and fine in tannins, this Pinot Noir is good now with food. It's silky and dry, with nuanced flavors of wild raspberries and cherries, cola, dried herbs and oak. Has enough balance and acidity to develop bottle complexity over the next 4-6 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"It is the Fernão Pires that gives this wine its class and freshness. The Sauvignon Blanc in the blend, with its herbaceous character, seems to clash. The wine is crisp with lemon flavors and brings an intense final acidity.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese White
"At two-plus years this Pinot Noir still is an infant. It's a swirl of new toasty oak, ripe cherries and currants, acidity and fresh, chunky tannins. It's a pity that much of it will be opened too young. Should be more harmonious toward the end of 2009, and evolve for many years after.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Pasty, chemical aromas do little to draw you in. The palate on this everyday Rioja is scratchy, while flavors of tart fruit with rubbery, pasty overtones fail to elevate the wine.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"The texture is a bit sharp, and the flavors range from blackberry to prune on this everyday, dry Cabernet.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Very treacly aromas of overripe strawberry, brown sugar and maple syrup show on this dessert-like wine. It's very sweet on the palate, with sweet tea, prune and raisin flavors.",US-California-Sangiovese

"Tart cherry, softened oak and firm tannin mark this 100% varietal wine most. It's fairly concentrated despite a leanness on the palate and finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This deeply colored, slightly sparkling dessert wine opens with aromas of ripe plum and raisin. The dense palate offers dried black cherry and sweet blueberry extract.",Italy-Central Italy-Lambrusco
"This medium-dry spätlese balances savory with sweet. Initially earthy, mineral tones build to plumper peach and pear through the midpalate. It's gossamer in texture, but finishes strong with a polished strike of steel and acid.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"This wine has a creamy, smooth character. Lightly buttery and with some ripe pear flavors, it is soft, refreshing and ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This is a big wine in structure, but mellow and complex in flavor as if it's been well aged. Blended from Grenache, Tempranillo and Monastrell, it smells lightly sweet and tastes dry and inviting like vanilla, milk chocolate and raspberries.",US-California-Red Blend
"Light, fresh and fruity, this is a lime and lemon flavored wine. It has a tangy, textured character that blends easily with the acidity. From a blend led by Grenache and Cinsault, it's a lively wine that will be a great apéritif.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Straightforward and easy-drinking, this starts off with aromas of red rose, violet and red berry. The bright palate offers up wild cherry layered with notes of cinnamon and white pepper balanced with zesty acidity and chewy tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Good and dry, but awkward, with slightly vegetal flavors sticking through riper ones of blackberries and black currants. The acid-tannin relationship also is unbalanced. Redeems itself on the finish, with a flourish of chocolate.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Inky red-purple in color and thick, this is a powerfully impressive Cabernet from the mighty Monte Rosso Vineyard. It's rich in spicy cinnamon, deep, dark plum and herbal tobacco. With the acidity in balance, it offers huge leather up front, dotted by undertones of cedar and pencil shavings. The finish is deftly accented by a seasoning of black pepper that lingers on the tongue.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This intriguing blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Verdelho is surprisingly effective. It benefits from the ripe, perfumed character of the Verdelho which dominates the palate. There is background freshness given by the Sauvignon. It's a ripe, full-bodied wine that is ready to drink.",Portugal-Península de Setúbal-Portuguese White
"A baked, sweet, candied Malbec with a gritty, sugary mouthfeel and sweet, zappy cherry and plum flavors. Hot and breaks down on the finish. Rudimentary.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Clean fruit-forward aromas of pear and tropical fruits introduce a smooth, slightly creamy palate with good acidic cut. Citrusy flavors of orange and lime dominate, while the finish is lasting and fresh.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Chardonnay
"Round aromas of chocolate-covered raisin set up a loaded palate. Salty berry, cassis, baking-spice and chocolate flavors finish with a full helping of berry and plum fruit, while this maintains a moderately full outlook on the finish. Drink through 2021.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Simple and a little one-dimensional in fruit and spice flavors, this dessert wine's main feature is sweetness. It has a flavor like the syrup from canned peaches.",US-California-Gewürztraminer
"Delicate melon and white-peach aromas lend softness to this bristling off-dry Riesling. Laser-sharp in style, it balances lime acidity with bright stone-fruit flavor and long, mineral streaks.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Bright and savory wine, it has a delicate floral fragrance of hawthorne and honeysuckle with a whiff of pear. The palate offers green apple, a hint of white peach and light mineral sensations.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Müller-Thurgau
"Pretty coffee and tobacco aromas add weight and persistency to this garnet colored Brunello. There's fruit here in the form of cherry, pomegranate and dried raspberry but those savory notes at the back really add to the wine's overall complexity.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Earthy, chunky plum aromas get nice accenting from baking spice and leathery notes. This is a fully extracted, full-bodied Malbec with minty, slightly medicinal black-cherry and berry flavors. A bright, dry, spicy finish works well. Drink through 2019.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Powerful whiffs of smoke and nuts lend a dark, savory tone to this brisk, medium-bodied wine. The palate is tart with flavors of pressed apple accented with grapefruit acidity and a hint of freshly cut grass.",US-New York-Sauvignon Blanc
"Juicy strawberries and plum are cut with allspice and star anise on the sharply spiced nose of this wine from one of the Golden State's legendary producers. The palate shows the juice of darker berries, from blackberries to black cherries, with an Earl Grey tea bitterness and dried sage complexity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Earthy and aggressively herbal, this new vintage of Rocheux needs more time to see if it will pull itself together. Tannic and hard-shelled, it's still hiding its fruit, and finishes with stemmy, bitter tannins.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Lots of elegance in this Cabernet. It's dry, full bodied and rich in tannins, with a good depth of black currants and sweet, toasty oak. Won't age, but who cares: Pop the cork and drink it now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This blend of Merlot (61%), Cabernet Sauvignon (27%), Syrah (8%) and Petit Verdot brings notes of anise, black currant, herbs, mint and raspberries. The palate brings good depth of flavors and richness while showing both elegance and precision.",US-Washington-Red Blend

"Despite moderate alcohol, this is full-bodied and almost sweet-tasting. Hints of dairy products combine with orange and pineapple flavors on the thickly textured palate.",Australia-Australia Other-Chardonnay
"This is an exceptional example of this variety, with aromas of fresh herb, violets, orange peel and black fruit. The dark-fruit flavors are rich and layered, showing an exquisite sense of balance along with great length.",US-Washington-Petit Verdot
"Strong now in fruity flavor and oak, with potent mountain tannins, this tiny-production Cab wants some time to knit together. It's rich and extracted in blackberry tart with the sweet smoky crust, black currant jam, blueberry, dark chocolate, anise and cedar flavors that finish in a complex swirl of dusty spices. Try after 2013.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sourced largely from the northern end of the region, this features bold blackberry flavors slightly reminiscent of preserves and marked by dark shadings of cola and chocolate. Yet despite the superripe flavors, the wine remains well structured and retains some slightly herbal overtones. Drink now–2012.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Baked plum, exotic spice and chocolate aromas almost jump out of the glass. The brawny palate doles out prune, blackberry jam, licorice and tobacco alongside round, velvety tannins. A raisin note backs up the finish.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"A lightly toasty character shows this has been subtly aged in wood. It adds spice, a creamy texture and richness to what is already a finely balanced wine. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese White
"This is a pretty, luminous straw-colored sparkler with subtle shadings of honey, stone fruit, white flower and mineral. The wine is crisp and drying in the mouth but it also imparts a slight sensation of sweetness in the form of peach flavors.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"Aged in large 130-gallon wood vats, this is Beaujolais made in a Burgundian style. It has ripe red fruits, a firm structure to allow aging and concentration. It will develop over the next two years to give a generous rich wine. This is Drouhin's second vintage of handling the vines, wines and marketing in partnership with the Hospices de Belleville charity. Drink from 2018.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This opens with aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, sun-baked soil and dark spice. The palate shows dried cherry, blackberry extract and a hint of anise alongside firm tannins. Drink over the next few years before the remaining fruit richness dries out.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"This is the inaugural release from this winery that focuses on the expression of Cabernet in a different site each year. It's dazzling, rich with blackberry, black currant, herb, dark chocolate and barrel spices. The full-bodied flavors are candy-bar sweet with some chewy tannic heft that bodes well for its potential in the cellar.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A bit sweet and rugged, with jammy blackberry, currant and pepper spice flavors wrapped into firm tannins. Shows Zin's briary, brambly character.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Notes of tart apple, fresh orange and yellow mirabelle plum announce pure-fruited joy. These flavors pervade nose and palate and are even more highlighted by a zesty, bright, lemony freshness on the concentrated, almost lip-smacking palate. This is dry and refreshing, taut and concentrated with a lasting, lemony finish.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"A darker shade of pink, this is rosé done in a rich style, but rather delicious throughout. Dark plum, baked cherry and ripe strawberry aromas meet with clove spice on the nose, and the palate offers tasty bubblegum and watermelon candy flavors. It's bold but balanced.",US-California-Rosé
"New wood and stalky fruit have combined well in this wine that is well on the way to being balanced and rich. The dry edge of tannins has smoothed well, giving a luscious wine that will develop quickly. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Dark and spicy, with rubber and baked-fruit aromas giving way to herbs, clove and other alluring spice scents. As might be expected from a wine bearing Alvaro Palacios' signature and approval, the final product is smart and snappy, with blackberry, herbs and barrel char all making themselves noticed. Good now and for the next several years.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"This has aromas of toast and exotic fruit that carry over to the palate along with notes of citrus zest, vanilla and roasted coffee bean. A hint of grilled herb marks the close.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"Initially, this wine is all about strawberry tart, with layers of cardamom and white pepper as well as hints of blueberry and blackberry on the back palate. Offering high-toned fruit and acidity, it settles on the finish, becoming rich and full bodied in style, with final notes of nutmeg, vanilla and chocolate.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Some good things are going on with this wine, including abundant red fruit and a soft feel. However the wood overpowers them with strong aromas and flavors of vanilla, dill and coconut along with a bitter note that distracts.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Shows lots of complexity, with a mèlange of blackberry, cherry, currant, mushu plum sauce, olive tapenade, black pepper and lightly oaked flavors that are wrapped into rich, sturdy tannins. Fine and dry, but a bit on edge now. Give it a year or two to soften.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Although it's not indicated on the label, this is a Blanc de Blancs from Chardonnay. It is warm and ripe, with a soft texture allied to fresh acidity. Orange and lemon zest give a great lift to this rounded wine.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"Inspired by the Loire Valley, where the “rocks decide” (as this bottling's name suggests), this wine is very light and almost cloudy in color, and shows tons of chalk, wet wool, lime peel and seashore on the nose. The texture is immensely intriguing, presenting flavors of just-ripe Anjou pear, cut grass, and iodine-like kelp tones, with a flash of petrol on the finish.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"The wine is soft, and full of fruit with attractive spicy black currant flavors. Dominated by the rounded Tinta Roriz, it is an easy wine to drink young.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"The wine, from this old vineyard, contains a good chunk of Petite Sirah, which adds body and tannins to the Zinfandel. It's a delicious wine, wonderfully drinkable, with deep, complex blackberry, cassis, dark chocolate, licorice, raisin, black pepper and sandalwood flavors that finish long and spicy.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Dark-skinned berry and ground clove aromas lift out of the glass. Reflecting the nose, the no-frills, enjoyable palate offers Marasca cherry and a black-pepper note alongside easygoing tannins. It's simple but well made.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Lamiable is a small house in Tours-sur-Marne at the eastern end of the Montagne de Reims. This Champagne is sourced exclusively from Grand Cru vineyards. Yellow-fruit, citrus and green plum aromas introduce a wine that is crisp and elegant, but with significant weight behind it. It's ready to drink now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Lots to admire in this wine, but it's not without its challenges. Likeable is the restrained alcohol and pleasant, silky texture that prevents heaviness. Flavorwise, there's a green, bell pepper streak to the riper cherries and black raspberries.",US-California-Grenache
"From a 29-acre property separate from the estate, this wine, made by the Saint-Maur team, benefits from the cool, 1,200-foot elevation that bestows a crisp, elegant character. It comes in an overweight statement bottle, four inches across at the base. Fortunately the wine is delicious, lightly perfumed and full of tantalizing white-peach flavors with a mineral structure that comes from schist soil. Age for a few more months and drink from late 2016.",France-Provence-Rosé
"While the wine is dry from the austere tannins, it also has a core of ripe berry fruits that are laced with acidity. It should develop some more and the tannins will soften, although they will always be very present. Drink from early 2018.",France-Provence-Provence red blend
"Generally speaking, Errazuriz's progressive wines hit their marks. But this Chard seems to be substituting oak for substance. The bouquet comes straight from the barrel, and the palate is resiny as it houses lemony, baked apple flavors. Finishes as woody as it began. Too much oak, plain and simple.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"Aged seven years in French oak, this is made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and then fortified with six-year-old, barrel-aged Cabernet Franc brandy. Very little is made. The experience is stellar, the dark-brown-red-hued wine opulent in red candy apple, chocolate and raspberries with ample acidity and a nuttiness to the finish. The pairing suggestion of a cigar is exactly right, though the wine will dance with nuts and cheeses or a decadent cheesecake too.",US-California-Port
"This may be a little sweet, hot and heavy, but it has such rich flavors of berry, currant, spice and mocha that it's easy to drink with ribs, chicken, burgers or vegetarian lasagna.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Aromas of acacia, orchard fruit and a whiff of wild fennel lead the nose on this blend of 50% Vermentino, 30% Chardonnay and 20% Malvasia. The round, full-bodied palate delivers ripe yellow apple, pastry and a hint of aromatic herb wrapped in a soft, creamy texture.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"Vinified in 100% new French oak, this is young, tight and showing the barrel flavors more than the fruit. As it opens, in come flavors of citrus skin, lemon drop and caramel. It's quite acidic, with good structure, and still has a yeasty finish.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Intensely dark in color, this syrupy rich, extracted Malbec pushes the envelope of max ripeness via heady balsamic aromas of leather, blackberry and cassis. The palate couldn't be much riper, while heavy oak means flavors of chocolate, vanilla and wood grain are as prominent as the wine's massive berry fruit components. Drink through 2020.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Prune is the most distinct aroma on a generic yet ripe nose. This feels shearing and high in acidity, while raspberry flavors fold in sharp tartaric notes. Short on the finish, as might be expected.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Polished but concentrated, fruity but complex, this beautifully shaped wine is simply delicious. While fairly full-bodied, it has an elegant texture, focused black-cherry flavors, harmonious and moderate oak notes. This is so tempting to drink now, but will be best after 2019.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Because its color comes from the grape skins rather than from the addition of red wine, this is a dark-hued rosé Champagne. It has a tannic edge that will soften with bottle age, allowing its red berry fruit to show better, so drink from 2018.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Organically grown fruit, aged in new wood for 12 months, creates this rich smooth wine. With a juicy oxidative character, it is soft and round. Yellow fruits and spice come together in a wine that is now ready to drink.",France-Southwest France-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"First recorded in 1375, this vineyard produces powerful, concentrated wines. This fine example is dense, weighty and firm. The acidity is there, buried in the firm tannins. It is a wine with an enormous potential, dark and full of plum skin and berries. Drink from 2022.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Dry, spicy and floral smelling, with modest herbal accents. The palate is saturated and fairly rich, with good texture and broad, satisfying flavors of berry and plum. Sturdy, consistent and fresh, with easy drinkability.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Merlot
"The winery's larger-scale Syrah (and that's still under 2,000 cases), this is a friendly, sophisticated Rhône-inspired wine grown on the cooler Sonoma Coast. Red and blue fruits are expertly ripe and high-toned, accented by layers of classic cool-climate spice.",US-California-Syrah
"If a Cabernet can be smooth and creamy, this one is. It offers plenty of fruit flavor, firm tannins that coat the mouth in a good way, plus a plush texture that keeps it from being even a bit harsh. With medium body, a great mouthfeel and lingering finish, there's much to like.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made with 100% native grape Cortese, this opens with aromas of apricot, white spring flower and a hint of beeswax. The medium-bodied palate delivers white peach, honeydew melon and a hint of white almond alongside bright acidity.",Italy-Piedmont-Cortese
"This limited-edition Pinot Gris was barrel-fermented and aged sur lie. It broadens out the palate and adds layers of buttered popcorn, caramel and toasted hazelnuts to the apple and pear fruit flavors.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Lightweight and silky in texture, this is a dry, refreshing rosé to drink while the warm weather persists. Hints of bubblegum detract slightly, but the primary notes of melon, citrus and wet stone combine easily on the palate.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"Flavors of beetroot and juicy fruit are juxtaposed in this structured yet fruity wine. It has some bitterness and a hint of wood, and there is intense acidity on the finish.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
"Vines planted in 1961 give this wine great concentration as well as impressive fruitiness. The wine is ripe, full in the mouth. It's also still young, with a tight structure and a mineral edge. This complex wine is likely to age well. Drink from late 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"From the home estate of wine academic and guru Denis Dubourdieu, this tight, nervy wine has a mineral character rounded by wild-strawberry flavors. An attractive citrus tang gives it good bite at the end. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"The wood fermentation has just brushed the ripe notes of this wine, rounding out the young, fresh fruitiness. It's a full wine with pear, citrus and a tangy, mineral texture. Drink from 2016.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"A touch leafy and candied smelling, but overall this is a steady value-priced Malbec with a tight feel, firm tannins and basic chocolate and berry flavors. Not a ton of nuance and variety; it's standard but good throughout.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A ripe rosé, full of rich strawberry fruits and balanced acidity. It is full bodied with just the right amount of crispness and intensity to give the wine weight and concentration. This will be a fine apéritif wine.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Big, full-bodied and very much a product of the 2010 vintage, this structured, generous wine needs time. The dry tannins are still prominent, giving a tough edge to the more generous, concentrated fruits. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a beautiful, fresh, relatively light and nicely balanced wine with a gorgeous array of vibrant fruit in both the aromas and the flavors. It pours on red and black cherry and raspberry while backing them up with good, taut acidity and light tannins.",US-California-Carignane
"Ripe dark fruit, leather and chocolate aromas lead the nose on this rich, full-bodied wine. The concentrated palate delivers layers of crushed black cherry, blackberry, cinnamon and clove. Accents of mocha and clove add depth while polished tannins give it a velvety texture. Drink 2015–2019.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Lifted, lemony freshness mixes with lime zest on the nose. Underneath some pungent arugula also dances on the palate, where pepperiness and fresh acidity guarantee pleasure with this concentrated but toned white.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"A rich, full-bodied wine from one of the masters of Tannat, Pierre Laplace, this has ripe tannins and layers of toast, black plum and berry, with intense acidity on the finish.",France-Southwest France-Tannat
"Dark and fiery, with grapy, heavily extracted aromas. Compared to the winery's Premium Cabernet, this is harder and more choppy, with staggering tannins and heat on the finish. It's a monster with teeth, and only time will tell if it finds a friendlier place. Hold for a couple of years.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is made from a collection of vineyards dotted along mountainous ridge lines and benchlands, most of these spots along the Mayacamas Mountains. Winemaker Randy Ullom captures a classic character of dried sage, cedar and pencil shavings here, supporting the savory with bright acidity and a strong presence of tannin. This wine could stand more time in the bottle before enjoying; its youthful grip doesn't go without notice.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A solid wine with firm tannins, this has structure as well as black-currant acidity. It still has a dry core although this will certainly soften over the next few months. It has the potential to be a ripe fruity wine from early 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Still young with its fresh raspberry acidity all in place, this is a fragrant and perfumed wine. A core of tannins hold its place, while it is the bright fruit and generous texture that are most marked. The aftertaste is fresh, fruity and has the structure for aging. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Dijon clones notwithstanding, this wine is buttery and oaky, emphasizing the flavors of barrel fermentation (in 40% new French oak). Apart from that, it shows moderate acids and a little heat in the finish.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"This Sangiovese-Syrah blend is the wine equivalent of a teenager that boasts youthful appeal. It has a solid core of fresh red fruit, especially cherries and blueberries. It lacks the sophistication of age and its aromas are so immediate; it's remotely reminiscent of a Beaujolais Nouveau. The mouthfeel is simple, fruity and fresh.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"A distinct aroma of freshly ground coffee hit the nose on this wine, followed by intriguing wafts of dark chocolate, aged Gouda, soy sauce and Oaxacan mole sauce. The palate is more familiar, with dark flavors of blackberry, black cherry and a touch of mint.",US-California-Syrah
"This is ripe, fruit-driven Shiraz with ample weight and ripeness. Hints of smoke and sage add nuance to the blueberry and black cherry fruit, while coarse-grained tannins provide adequate structure and grip. Drink now–2022.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"A simple, sugary wine, with candied berry, anise and cocoa flavors, wrapped into soft tannins.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A very perfumed, fragrant and refreshing wine. It is full in the mouth, ripe, smelling of hedgerow blossoms and having a touch of spring in its fruits. Ready to drink, but also keep until 2016.",France-Alsace-Riesling

"Attractively perfumed, this Verdier family wine comes from Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon vineyards in their first certified French organic vintage. The wine is a smooth and polished. New wood flavors show strongly, after 16 months in barrel, alongside the ripe tannins and black plum fruits. It has rich potential and a strong presence. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Initially this is a touch jumpy and nervy smelling, but with airing it shows elegant blueberry, cassis and mineral notes that aren't just big and brawny. A flush, bold mouthfeel delivers on the promise of the bouquet, while ripe plum, blackberry, pepper, herb and saline flavors finish savory and dark, with chocolaty notes and ripped muscularity. Drink this staunch Malbec from 2017 through 2023.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"From a selection of parcels, this cuvée is, for the vintage, concentrated and rich. Firm and tough tannins do show, although the dominant character is sweet fruit.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This is a simply delicious and assertive wine that smells like roses and lemon zest, tastes like fresh apricots and biscotti and has a tangy, appetizing balance. It will be super as an apéritif for a summer time outdoor dinner.",US-California-Viognier
"From the producer's sloping vineyard at a 750-foot elevation in the eastern section of the appellation, this wine also contains 4% Malbec from the same site. Earthy in stewed mushrooms, grilled meat and bouillon, it's a bold, dense powerhouse of a wine, with a tobacco-laden finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A blend of fruit from the McGinley and Grassini vineyards, this wine is fermented in oak barrels, yielding a nose that's an approachable buffet of nectarine, wet cement, chopped lemongrass and wet hay. The oak also gives the palate more weight to deliver flavors of green-apple slices, kumquat, lime zest and cut lawn.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"A top quality rosé; fruity and textured, providing a bone dry wine that is made to be paired with food. Bright acidity is infused among raspberry and mulberry fruit flavors, adding intensity and freshness. Drink now.",France-Provence-Rosé
"A little creamy, waxy and scattershot, but also far more exotic and different than most $8 wines. This is barrel-fermented Viura, but the oak level is light and manageable. Flavors of papaya, melon and citrus are almost tropical in scope, and the finish is pretty fresh. Drink right away for maximum freshness.",Spain-Northern Spain-Viura
"With its Mourvèdre content, this is a big-hearted wine. It is finely balanced between its rich yellow and red fruits and spice and acidity. This is a great food rosé, textured and ripe.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This single block selection is a truly pretty wine, with scents and flavors of rose petals, raspberries, brown spices, nutmeg and mocha. It's complex and elegant, with a mouth-pleasing creaminess.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Earthy and stemmy in dark black fruit, this wine contains 2% Syrah from Dunnigan Hills, though it's unclear how that contributes. Thin on the palate, it has a medicinal, minty flourish on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"From one of the westernmost vineyards in the county, just a few miles from the chilly Pacific, comes this dark, intense Pinot. Tasted in 2007, it was too tightly wound and too young to appreciate fully, with grapy, primary fruit flavors of blackberries, cherries and cola. It should be mellower now, however.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is from a tremendous vineyard site near the top of the appellation, situated from 1,250 to 1,800 feet. It incorporates small additions of Zinfandel and Carignane into the whole, a picture of soft beguiling violet aromas that are followed by a velvety texture and underlying grip of tannin. Rich red fruit and a taste of licorice linger on the intense finish.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Exquisitely fresh and fruity, this delicious rosé has crisp red currant fruits that are tangy, bright and tight. It is very refreshing now, although in a few months the almost shocking acidity will soften. Drink from mid-2016.",France-Loire Valley-Rosé
"From a vineyard that is shaped like a butterly (Papillon), this is a ripe, rich and dry wine. It has honey, almonds and fresh pear, with a taut mineral structure to hold it all together. Although delicious, the wine is still too young, so wait until 2017 for it to begin to shine.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"Here's a creamy white that delivers aromas and flavors of white peach, pear and white almond. A mineral note and fresh acidity lift the finish.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega

"Tangy boysenberry and elderberry fruit shows on the nose of this sultry bottling, along with thyme, potpourri and licorice. The flavors are more cooked than fresh, recalling charred blackberry, dried blueberry, leather and licorice. It's a hearty wine that consumes the entire palate.",US-California-Syrah
"This is Doubleback's first vintage to include estate-grown grapes in the blend. Truffle, mocha and ripe purple-fruit scents explode from the glass. Ample acidity underscores the chewy tannins. A dense and ageworthy wine, this needs more bottle-age to show its best; try after 2018.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Creamy and fresh, this off-dry sparkler offers heady aromas of exotic fruit, candied orange peel and ripe peach. The foaming palate doles out ripe apple, Bartlett pear and crystallized ginger alongside crisp acidity that gives it an almost linear quality.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"The aromas on this wine are surprisingly blue fruited for a Cabernet, followed by notes of herb, green pepper and spice. The flavors are lightly sweet, followed by a spice-filled finish. It's a straightforward quaffer that doesn't quite show its variety.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This blend smells outright herbaceous and weedy. An astringent volatile palate is grating, while this tastes much like it smells: weedy and green.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Lime, chewing gum and dusty aromas are simple. This is juicy but shows no real point of reference on the palate. Hollow flavors of pear and briny citrus finish with a note of nectarine and scouring acidity.",Spain-Northern Spain-Chardonnay
"Contemporary Grenache Blanc expressions lean tight and bright, but this bottling takes an extremely tropical approach, showing honeydew, banana cream and bubblegum on the nose. It's restrained upon first sip before overpowering tropical waves take hold. A well-made wine, it will find fans who crave this flowery style.",US-California-Grenache Blanc
"A lovely Pinot Noir, dry and silky and rich, with complex flavors of raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, sandalwood and white pepper. Easy to drink now for its sleekness and elegance. Only 296 cases were produced but a single-vineyard wine worth seeking out.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Showing excellent concentration and structure, this sharply etched wine sets vivid fruit flavors of raspberries and pie cherries against buoyant acidity. The focus is excellent, right on through a crisp finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's lots to like in this affordable Zin. It's robust and juicy with ripe blackberry, cherry, cocoa, black pepper and sandalwood flavors that finish slightly sweet. Nice with pizza, burgers or beef tacos.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Combining blackberry jam aromas with rich, ripe fruit flavors, this wine is medium to full bodied, and feels relatively easygoing for this grape variety.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"This is a textbook Chianti Classico, with dark berry and plum aromas accented by hints vanilla and clove. The palate boasts a core of wild cherry flavors layered with balsamic herbs. Still tightly tannic, it needs a few more years to unwind.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Grapefruit, mineral and freshly cut grass aromas lead the way. On the palate, brisk acidity supports pink grapefruit, tangerine and a mineral note.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"Aromas of toasted oak, tropical fruit and a marked medicinal note lead the nose. The round palate offers oak, pear, citrus peel and a bitter note recalling adhesive bandage.",Italy-Piedmont-Arneis
"Savory notes slowly unfold—almost like the umami-touch of soy sauce —amidst the dark cherry fruit, while juicy accents suggest this should be paired with Asian cuisine.Try this with five-spice roast ribs or pork belly and plum sauce. Structured, slightly grippy tannins and fresh acidity keep everything in check.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Zweigelt
"This winery has succeeded in producing a lovely Bordeaux-blend wine in this difficult vintage. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, and including all five classic Bordeaux grapes, this wine is rich and opulent with blackberry jam, blueberry, currant and anise flavors, enhanced with new oak. Give it a decant and enjoy it over the next year or two.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Firm and with dark tannins, this wine has great potential. Ripe berry fruits and a concentrated structure are already well balanced with acidity cutting through. As it matures, this wine with its dense structure will develop well. Drink from 2017. Enologist Sebastien and vineyard manager Nicolas are the latest Carreau generation managing family estates.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The somewhat prominent herb aromas don't seem varietal. The red-fruit flavors are considerably more germane, though the tannins come off as a bit sticky.",US-Washington-Merlot

"This brut has a fragrance of liqueur and oak, which is also evident in the palate. In the mouth, it's lean and linear, lacking fruit flavors and richness.",Italy-Lombardy-Sparkling Blend
"Light and bright, this fruity wine has a more bitter element that gives a sharper character that will hopefully round out. At the back, plenty of acidity leaves a crisp aftertaste.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"Full bodied and richly tannic, this gives lie to the notion that all Grenache-based blends are easy quaffers. Dried spices and mixed berries include hints of clove and cracked pepper, finishing with some dry, chewy tannins. The assemblage is 49% Grenache, 29% Shiraz and 22% Mourvèdre. Drink 2020–2030.",Australia-South Australia-G-S-M

"The top cuvée of Sauvignon Blanc from the Borgo Conventi estate, now owned by Ruffino but still run by the Vescovo family. This is a huge, rich, forward style of Sauvignon, very ripe and tropical. Yet it has a layer of crisp, grassy fruit that gives it balance and poise.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon Blanc

"This medium-bodied Chardonnay is plump without being heavy, featuring modest citrus aromas but greater depth of fruit on the palate, adding pear and melon flavors to the mix. It's fresh and lively on the finish, which should serve it well with a wide variety of dishes. Drink now–2013.",Australia-Victoria-Chardonnay
"This pure varietal seems underripe, with scents of mushrooms and tar, and no fruit in sight. The finish turns bitter, with dry tannins.",US-Oregon-Merlot
"Too ripe, with prune, chocolate and raisin flavors that taste hot and sweet in high alcohol. With hard tannins, it could almost be a minor Port.",US-California-Malbec
"The winery initially produced Cabernet, a fact fans of its white wines might not know. This vintage offers 83% Cabernet Sauvignon blended with 11% Cabernet Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Puckering in tannin, it offers faint mint and high-toned black cherry, the finish ripe and vanilla-sweet.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Lots of oak on this Chardonnay, but it's awkward, and feels overworked and sweetly simple, despite some pretty pineapple jam flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Richly satisfying this offers powerful tannins and equally powerful, juicy fruits. It has a great sense of structure, density and potential. Ripe berry and black plum fruits push through the impressive tannins to produce a wine that is developing well, although it will need several more years. Drink from 2018.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Earth and smoke join fruity, fresh apples on the nose. The palate is equally apple-fruited and very appetizing, full of freshness and friendly fruit on a dry, slender body. The juicy, poised cleanliness lingers beautifully.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Affordable and exuberant, this Pinotage/Merlot blend starts with cherry, vanilla and cedar aromas followed by bright flavors of fruit and spicy pepper. The finish is spicy and assertive. A great wine for grilled meats and more robust cuisine, and a fun introduction to Pinotage.",South Africa-Western Cape-Red Blend

"The aromas of marionberry, licorice and herb bring a sense of purity, along with light whiffs of oxidation. The dark-fruit flavors are a strange mixture of sweet and tart, not entirely coming together. It doesn't quite stand up on its own but should fit in well at the dinner table.",US-Washington-Malbec
"Shows balance and integration and a dark, inky appearance. Blackberry, plum cake, cinnamon bun, leather and tobacco aromas. Chewy, ripe mouthfeel frames plush fruit, while the dusty, structured finish features loads of dried tobacco leaf.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"This blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre, Carignan, Counoise, Grenache and Cinsault immediately appeals with its aromas of plum, candied raspberry and garrigue, with no oak influence anywhere in sight.

"Head-trained, century-old vines, provide intense scents with old vine herbal, herbaceous accents. Watermelon, hay and strawberries, intensely extracted and 17.5% alcohol. This is over-the-top winemaking, with powerful old vine fruit, and a big, extracted finish, with lingering toasty, hazelnut and vanilla highlights.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Vanilla, tobacco and anise flavors quickly overwhelm the fruit; perhaps the wine just needs to breathe longer. At first taste, it quickly turns tannic and very drying; the fruit is buried and the oak flavors are still a bit jarring and disjointed.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This youthful pink-colored number smells of dusty cherry and Lifesavers. A juicy palate has a soda-like feel, while flavors of raspberry and cherry are light and dilute across the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Rosé
"Made by David Ramey, this blend of 80% Zinfandel, 11% Alicante and 9% Petite Sirah impresses in its fruit-forward approachability and all-around likability. Earthy, it teases in dark cherry, vanilla and milk-chocolate flavors, the texture smoothly etched in fine leather.",US-California-Red Blend
"Light aromas of ripe pear and jasmine precede medium-sweet, somewhat oily-feeling flavors. It doesn't all come together but still provides enjoyment.",US-Washington-Riesling

"This year's dry conditions produced a fine crop of single quinta vintage Ports. That's perfect for the concentration in a Colheita tawny. This wine is rich, dense and with perfumed fruits that are still in evidence behind the old gold flavors of the wood aging. Drink now.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Unusually lean and precise for a 2006, this shows some very floral, perfumed notes on the nose, and then delivers crisp green apple and underripe melon flavors.",Germany-Nahe-Riesling
"Of this winery's two new releases, the less expensive is better, because this usually fine release is from the infamous ‘98 vintage. It just can't overcome a basic thinness and wateriness, despite an obvious pedigree and plush oak. That said, it's a good wine. The ‘99 will undoubtedly be much better.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is tart and also overripe, with a sharp, raisin taste that leads to a bitter finish. A blend of Merlot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon.",US-California-Red Blend
"Initially it's rugged, but airing reveals black-cherry aromas and dry spice. The palate is crisp and a little sheer by itself, but the call here is that with food it'll be a winner. Flavors of red fruits are dry and collected, while the finish blends in coffee, spice and a touch of herbal Navarran panache.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Too much unripeness in this wine, which shows aromas of asparagus and broccoli. Tastes somewhat better than it smells, with blackberry and black cherry notes.",US-California-Syrah

"This wine from the Corton Grand Cru vineyard is packed with tannins as well as smoky fruit.

The wine will need considerable aging; drink from 2025.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Spicy and bright, this blend of Cabernet and five other black grapes is a bit diffuse. A mix of berries and astringent tannins dominate, with black tea in the finish. Will show best with grilled meats.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A drying mineral note of slate or graphite runs through the middle of this plush and rich red Ripassato wine from Valpolicella. Background notes of spice and cherry cola come through as well, especially in the mouth where the wine boats a soft, compact feel. Pair this wine with lamb or light beef dishes.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This reserve begins as a vineyard-block selection, and spends nine months in 100% French oak. It's bright and brambly, melding citrus skins and oils, fresh raspberries and cherries, and a touch of chocolate. There's a hint of dustiness as well, and it's drinking quite well already: no need to wait.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Dense packed earth and a wild edge make for a complex experience in this vineyard-designate, from a hilltop site tended by fellow vintner and grape grower, Steve MacRostie. Blackberry, plum and herb flirt around light-bodied layers of black tea, with a finish of high-strung black cherry.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"This Barolo shows funky aromas of rubber and animal—common for the scorching 2009 vintage in this area. Despite its core of dark cherry fruit, this is very astringent and brutally tannic, with a short finish. Don't think this will evolve well.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Dark, minty, inky aromas of blackberry are rugged. Same for the palate, which is pinched and rubbery, with grabby tannins. Flavors of toasted, blackened berry fruits are chocolaty and well oaked.

"Aromas of roasted earth, leather and fine oak are more out-front than berry fruit, and that's the way it should be for a Gran Reserva. This feels bold, lively and still a touch bumpy. Chocolaty oak and vanilla notes rest comfortably on top of ripe berry and black-plum flavors, while the finish is persistently earthy and chocolaty. Drink through 2028.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo

"The vineyard is in the Santa Rita Hills, and the wine impresses with the classic structure of this fine coastal appellation.

"Big and bold stuff from southern Spain with burnt, hot aromas of roasted black fruits and stems. Better on the palate, where it brings plum and berry flavors but also some heat and saline. Slightly stemmy and roasted on the finish, much like the bouquet.",Spain-Levante-Monastrell
"From a vineyard owned by Talley but shared in equal parts with two other wineries, this bottling is snappy on the nose with black raspberry, graphite, sweet juniper and rose hip aromas. On the palate, it's light in body and lively with acidic energy, offering raspberry, tart plum skin and sour cherry, inflected with anise spice. There is significant length to the mouthwatering finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"An elegant, floral Pinot Noir from Patagonia's top producer of PN. Barda is warm, creamy and intense. An emphasis on balanced raspberry and cherry flavors mixed with rose hip and freshness gives it an Old World personality. A very drinkable and honest style of red wine. Good now into 2011.",Argentina-Other-Pinot Noir
"Part of the fun of exploring Argentine Malbec is tasting all the new kids on the block. Having not seen Guentota before, all signs point to high quality. The bouquet is dark, with accents of cola, mineral and burnt toast giving it a masculine edge. Round, plump and full in the mouth, with cherry, berry and cassis flavors. A total package of a wine, with character, nuance and serious base-level fruit.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This kitchen-sink blend is fruit forward with aromas of raspberry jam and plum along with pencil lead and vanilla accents. Flavors are sweet and generous, with a rounded feel and a lingering finish. It drinks best at a cool 62.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Subdued aromas of sawdust, dark spice, grilled herbs and dark-skinned berry slowly emerge on this blend of Sangiovese, Colorino and Merlot. The palate offers dried black cherry, menthol and clove alongside smooth tannins. Drink through 2018.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This wine is floral and spicy on the nose, but lacks the richness on the midpalate to fully support those ambitions. The result is a highly perfumed but modestly flavored wine with medium body and a dusty finish. Drink now.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style White Blend
"The new American oak brings notes of vanilla, wood and coconut that largely overwhelms the seemingly green, citrusy fruit. There's a pleasing tartness to the acids but overall the fruit flavors get lost.",US-Washington-Tempranillo
"This reserve wine is a four grape, Bordeaux-style blend, with Cabernet Sauvignon holding the principal spot. The flavors are diffuse, lightly herbal and peppery, with little concentration or definition.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Simple, regular peach and pear aromas lead to a palate of sweet apple flavor and mild citric bite. This is the ultimate in basic Chilean Chardonnay: it's clean, a little dull and melony, and sweet. Drink soon.",Chile-Central Valley-Chardonnay
"This has a classic, lighter red color and equally classic aromas of red cherry, sour cherry, black tea, lightly toasted oak and a touch of forest floor. Generous cherry and plum flavors are perfectly balanced with crisp acidity and fine-grained tannins. It's not a big wine, but a vivid, polished and memorable one.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"At five years, this Cabernet is not aging well. It's soft and simple, with the black cherry fruit flavors thinning out, letting hot alcohol show through.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Just a couple of barrels were produced of this vineyard-designate. Tasting of lush strawberry preserves, it's nicely focused, slightly peppery, and offers skin flavors as well as fleshy fruit. Sweet barrel spices carry a hint of clove, and round off a big, delicious finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Fits the fashion for very pale rosé, with delicate pink color and aromas of struck flint and passion fruit. In the mouth, it's mouthwatering and plump, with peachy notes and a bit of lime zest to finish. Drink now.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"A richer, yet no better, style than the 2000 Limestone Coast bottling. Peach and vanilla aromas and flavors take the lead, with buttered popcorn and alcoholic warmth playing supporting roles. The finish is long, featuring a slightly bitter note akin to citrus rind.",Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"Very crisp and fruity, this is a light, bright and refreshing wine, with a tangy edge that gives texture. Apples and a strong citrus character promise a wine that will round out over the next few months. Drink from late 2015.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This is citrusy and also a bit tropical on the bouquet, and together the aromatic mix is appealing. A fresh mouthfeel is a bonus, and standard Torrontés flavors of melon, lychee and banana finish with balance and bright acidity. This hails from La Rioja, and it captures most of what's good about the variety.",Argentina-Other-Torrontés
"Big aromas of blackberry, leather, turned earth and white mushroom set up a bright, layered palate with fresh acidity at its core. Floral, exotic red-berry flavors are spicy and in sync with each other. A crisp, peppery finish with toasty oak ensures that this single-vineyard Malbec is built to last. Drink through 2025.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Espresso, toast and spice aromas lead the nose and carry over to the palate alongside notes of black cherry and compact tannins. Despite the tannic structure, this isn't an ager so drink soon to capture the remaining fruit flavors.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Citrus, spring blossom and apple aromas follow over to the straightforward easygoing palate along with peach and a candied note. Lively acidity provides the backdrop.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"As happens in Côtes de Bourg, Malbec forms part of the blend in this wine. This would explain the firm dry tannins that give it a big structure and weight. Along with the dry character, there is the beginnings of red berry fruit. The wine needs several years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Made with skins to add color, this dark-orange-pink wine has fine red-berry aromas. It is dry and crisp with lively acidity as well as red-currant flavors. Drink this attractive wine now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Fresh, clean apple and white-peach aromas are good but not overly expressive or complex. This feels fresh and lifted, with minerally, stony flavors of apple and lime. A clean, pointed finish feels nice and tastes like lettuce and bitter greens.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Baked, rooty aromas of sandalwood, exotic spices and berry fruits are attractive. Though slightly grabby on the palate, this shows the right structure and build. Flavors of up-front oak, herbal plum and raspberry finish dry, with firm, pinching tannins. Drink through 2021.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This fruit-driven, medium-bodied rosé is a perennially worthy addition to the cooler of poolside staples. Hints of peach and raspberry are ripe but restrained, with just enough thirst-quenching acidity on the finish.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"Rich and fine in the mouth, with cherry and currant preserves, chocolate and tangerine zest flavors wrapped into sturdy tannins. Could use a greater fruity concentration and sweetness, though, as the heat from high alcohol shows through.",US-California-Syrah
"Salinic and pungent, with celery, green citrus and nettle aromas. This is pure SB, although it's not 100% SB because Secreto always has a little something else in the blend. Fresh, acidic and alive, with lime and slightly pickled accents to the finish.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Oily citrus aromas are round and briny. This feels front-loaded, meaning there isn't much depth to the palate. Short, lightly stalky apple and citrus flavors turn pithy on the finish.",Argentina-Other-Chardonnay
"Barrel fermentation has rounded and softened this wine without it losing focus. Crisp apple and pear fruit carries it, with a whiff of white asparagus.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Fruity aromas of dark berry and scorched soil lead the nose on this informal red. The simple easygoing palate offers morello cherry and a hint of dried herb alongside soft, fleeting tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"While the wine is soft and almost ready to drink, it does also have the Douro mineral texture and dry tannins. The Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo) dominates, giving the wine its round and rich character. Drink now or wait until 2016 for the tannins to soften further.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"A generous wine, this is packed with red fruits as well as firmly structured. It conveys the fresh acidity of the year, with fine smoky tannins. It will be an impressive wine. Drink from 2020.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Whiffs of smoke and earth lend complexity to this light-bodied kabinett. Delicately concentrated yet approachably fruity, it offers sweet-tart mango, peach and tangerine flavors and comes to a clean, elegant finish.",Germany-Nahe-Riesling
"Still a little hard and tight, with a flavorful mix of plum and black fruits, this may need extra breathing time to show its full strength. Some whiffs of smoke and coffee linger on the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This pure, single vineyard Viognier enters the mouth rather soft and silky, with well-structured flavors of cantaloupe melon, grapefruit and pineapple. It shows good concentration, focus and length, and will age nicely for another five or six years.",US-Washington-Viognier
"This Chardonnay's lees, custard, pear and spice aromas are somewhat inharmonious. It's elegant on the palate, however, showing graceful apple flavors.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"The wine is crisp, packed with grapefruit flavors and with a tight texture that suggests it could age. A tang and a steely acidity comes in behind the fruit and offers an austere aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"This juicy, solid red offers aromas of scorched earth, mature berry, dark spice and a whiff of game. The chewy palate delivers ripe black cherry, raisin, star anise and clove alongside rounded tannins.",Italy-Central Italy-Montepulciano
"The aromas of orange and mineral are uncomplicated and friendly. It feels pure and offers good flow, with apple, lime, mineral, white pepper and anise flavors. Fruity, dry and composed on the finish, this is great wine for patio sipping or pairing with seafood.",Spain-Galicia-White Blend
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (62%), Cabernet Franc (30%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of coffee, dried herbs, green pepper and smoke are followed by creamy-feeling cherry and café au lait flavors. It brings a whole lot of appeal.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This lovely, layered wine from the Santa Ynez Valley-based producer shows iron, cranberry, shiitake, cola and cherry on the nose. Those same elements are delicately woven into the palate, enhanced by a Sichuan peppercorn kick and vibrant acidity that will ensure a long life ahead. Its flavors continue to unwind as it opens in the glass.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A gold color indicates maturation, while loud, tropical fruit aromas fold in lychee, citrus blossom and sweat. The palate is electric due to citric acidity, while flavors of orange, tangerine, lemon-lime and grapefruit finish with a chalky feel.",Argentina-Other-Torrontés
"Simple sweet apple and poached pear notes meet with a slight tonic and guava nectar on the nose of this bottling that blends the Four Lanterns and Mill Road vineyards. Yellow apple and Anjou pear pop on the palate that ends on a yellow-grapefruit-peel finish, altogether clean and crisp.",US-California-Viognier
"It's rich in mango, peach, vanilla, buttered toast and brown sugar flavors, with a clean, tart mouthfeel.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Fire up the grill, or pan fry a juicy steak to eat with this robust red wine, a Bordeaux blend with 24% Syrah. It's bone dry and tannic and juicy in berries, cherries, currants, leather and herbs, and while it's an easy sipper, the structure was harder to achieve than you might think.",US-California-Red Blend
This is a light- to medium-bodied rosé made exclusively from Syrah grown in the northern reaches of the Rhône Valley. The cooler climate gives it a lighter bearing and redder fruit flavors than many other Rhône rosés: this one resembles red plum and pineapple. Drink now.,France-Rhône Valley-Syrah
"A lively, well-made blend of Tempranillo, Malbec and Syrah; B Crux is a bouncy, fresh youngster but still a serious wine with rock-solid black fruit, deep chocolate and spicy length. It's not super oaky as only half the wine sees new barrels, but you can definitely taste some wood. Will drink best in 2009–2010.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Pretty white-flower, lemon and lime notes waft from the glass of this dry light-bodied Sauvignon Blanc. It's vibrantly fruity, full of fresh pineapple and nectarine flavors accented by a swathe of green herb and bramble. The finish is refreshing, crisp and mineral. Drink now through 2019.",US-New York-Sauvignon Blanc
"Light and fruity, this wine's berry flavor dominates the gentle tannins, while the bright acidity adds lift. Drink this in the next two years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Spicy, meaty flavors like black pepper and beef broth blend with substantial fruit flavors in this medium-bodied, dry and rather sophisticated wine. It's almost a meal in itself, and well-balanced.",US-California-Red Blend
"A little pricey for the quality, but still, this is a super-drinkable Chardonnay. It's semi-sweet and brisk in acidity, with a cut of minerality supporting ripe orange, pineapple, vanilla and buttered toast flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Aromas of toasted hazelnuts and yeast give way on the palate to oranges, cloves and golden delicious apples. The Bolly house style of weight and heft is well displayed here, balanced out by a long, taut finish.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"With just 2% Syrah, this is a Bordeaux-style blend, feauturing mostly Cabernet and Merlot. The rich entry features berry, chocolate and espresso, with a round midpalate and polished tannins. A hint of tar runs through the finish.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The nose is rich with Red Delicious apple notes. The palate adds lemon freshness and a tangy, slightly bitter but appetizing streak of zestiness. The finish is restrained, just dry and clean.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Sourced from a pair of Yamhill-Carlton vineyards, this steely effort opens with herbal beet-root aromatics. It's tight and a bit attenuated, with streaks of anise, tart berry and a touch of rhubarb. It slowly fleshes out with ample aeration.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of resin, underbrush, vanilla and espresso lead the nose on this warm, forward wine. The evolved palate offers toast, raisin and roasted coffee bean but not much fruit richness. It's already tired so drink now.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"An eccentric wine that will appeal to some with exotic tastes. The tropical fruit, Asian pear and melon flavors are drying out, reverting to cashew nuts, herbs and minerals. With crisp acidity, this Chardonnay is headed into interesting, offbeat places.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Babich's top Sauvignon is a big step up in quality, featuring more weight and intensity than its regular bottling. Tropical--think passion fruit--flavors are accented by grassy notes, with grapefruit notes forming the core. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"This medium-bodied wine blends lively citrus and crisp apple aromas with just-rich-enough pear, apple and butter flavors for good balance. Satisfying and refreshing, it will be great with many different dishes.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Baldassari's 2010 is rich in blackberries, currants, mocha and crispy bacon, but the texture is off. Drink up.",US-California-Syrah
"Although the wine is made in stainless steel, there's a tiny touch of oxidation here (only a distant accent) that shapes a warmer, broader bouquet of stone fruit, honey and butterscotch. It's silky and smooth on the close. Drink now.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Catarratto
"The fruit and structure of this monopole bottling from Nuiton-Beanoy are already well integrated. With a smoky character from wood aging and a core of firm tannins and acidity, it manages to feel ripe and crisp at the same time. Drink from 2020.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Ripe yellow apples and touches of banana and pineapple show on the nose of this bottling. It also has a restrained, steely frame to the aromas, along with some flint. Honeysuckle, jasmine and apple-blossom flavors show on the sip, which is quite floral, and also offers white peach and salt.",US-California-Viognier
"This Pinot shows the ripe, sunny richness that a good vintage in California can coax out of the grapes. It's enormous in raspberries and cherries, with plenty of new French oak bringing smoky, buttered toast complexities.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Herbal and grassy, with lots of juicy apple and lemon flavors, this is a dry, yet round and supple Pinot Gris. Effortlessly enjoyable, this finishes quite floral, with just a hint of savory nut skin and smoke.",US-New York-Pinot Gris
"Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, this brawny, full-bodied wine evokes tobacco, coconut and cherry cola, the flavors commingling within a frame of taut structure and moderate acidity.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"In reaction to Mount Etna's volcanic eruptions, local farmers have adopted a unique mix of Christianity and mysticism to protect against imminent dangers. Many vineyard sites are anointed with religious names, like Santo Spirito, as if the name were a lucky charm in itself. This delightful vineyard-designate wine is ethereal and bright, with loads of small berry intensity and a dusty, dry finish.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"Soft red apple, hard peach, green fig and underripe banana peel all marry with an underlying yellow floral note. Light and easy in the mouth with a short but clean finish.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Chenin Blanc
"A blend of five diverse red grapes, this lightly fruity quaffer is almost invisible as far as flavor is concerned. It hits the tongue and vanishes.",US-Oregon-Red Blend
"Lush aromatics feature sassafras, strawberry pastry and milk chocolate. This forward, seductive wine offers complex red-fruit flavors with details of cinnamon toast, coffee grounds and dark chocolate.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of citrus zest, stone fruit, toasted almond and a whiff of light baking spice lead the way on this polished white. The vibrant, elegantly structured palate shows Bosc pear, white peach, nectarine and a hint of ginger. A mineral note backs up the finish.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"Maple-tinged oak aromas are huge and frame equally massive black-fruit scents. A tight clampy palate needs time to soften and expand; it's hard and unyielding now. Flavors of black fruits, coffee, chocolate and heavy oak finish firm and peppery, with a reprise of grabby, grating tannins. Drink from 2020 through 2030.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Raspberry fruit shines through with ample backing acidity. The flavors are true and fresh, though the wine seems to thin out midpalate. It was fermented with wild yeast and aged for 15 months in the barrel.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"The d'Arenberg style favors structure over plushness, even in Grenache. This is crisp and firm, its cranberryish fruit tinged with hints of raspberry, orange zest, cinnamon and clove. Give it a few years to soften. Drink 2020–2030.",Australia-South Australia-Grenache
"A subtle hint of sandalwood and rose plays alongside the juicy pear of the palate. There is a rich floral creaminess on the palate that flashes a touch of vanilla and hints of Damask rose. A pleasantly bitter phenolic edge gives direction to the dynamic energy of fruit that trembles at the core of this wine. Hints of rose, lemon oil and peach linger long after the last sip. This is concentrated, off dry and energetic. Drink 2017–2027.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Banana, lemon-lime and even some lychee give this a fruity, slightly sweet bouquet. The mouth is solid, while flavors of lemon, melon and lychee are driving but candied. Not too oaky, but plenty honeyed and melony. Good if you're not seeking a serious, Burgundy-styled wine.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"Jammy, floral aromas fold in graphite, blueberry and cassis accents. The palate is tight and firm, with mild astringency due to the strong tannins. It bears flavors of herbal berry, saline and rubbery earth, and the finish includes green herb and salt notes.",Chile-Curicó Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This field blend of old white-grape vines—a rarity in the Douro—is rich in the bottle from a mélange of stainless steel, wood fermentation and barrel aging. It is smooth with concentration from the toast flavors and floral complexity. Its ripe character and generous texture make it a wine to drink now.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"A steely wine, it's tight with acidity and apple fruit flavors. It has a brighter, crisper side, but the wine is still nervy and textured. Acidity at the end means it can age. Drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"With some good maturity, this is a rich, fruity Champagne. It comes from the southern Aube region, which endows a more tropical feel, bringing out melon and apricot fruit flavors as well as crisper citrus. A great apéritif style, it will also go with food.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Only slight notions of fruit appear on the nose. The palate is softly fruited with ripe pear and tart apple, achieving a beautiful, unobtrusive and quiet balance. This wine may be quiet and understated but it has honesty and a supple drinkability that makes you want more. Subtle notes of orange peel become more convincing with every sip.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"This soft and fruity wine may be young, but with its bright red fruits, it's ready to drink. Its juicy red berry flavors are filled with spice and a minty character from wood aging. It finishes with ripe fruitiness.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Huge in color and extract, but also a little childish. The nose has gumball, berry jam and a touch of volatility, but after things settle it rests on bold black fruit. It's not overly rich or sweet, and the feel is sort of sinewy. Seems more about size and color than refinement and polish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Beautifully evocative notes of apricot and peach compote appear first. They are joined by blossom honey and a floral touch that fully flourishes on the palate. They are joined by fresh, lively and spicy pink grapefruit and spice. This is full-on bursting with fruit flavors but still manages to balance its exuberance with lovely, illuminating freshness.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"87-89 The wine is out of focus, with fruit lost in a structure that hasn't come together. It has weight and acidity, plum fruits showing slowly.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Taut, tart and tangy, this well-built wine was fermented in neutral oak. It's got a pleasant creaminess in the mouth, sharply defined citrus fruits, notably grapefruit and Meyer lemon, and supporting acidity.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"This simple but inviting wine is made from a blend of 60% Sangiovese and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. The bright palate boasts sour cherry, red currants and light note of white pepper alongside fresh acidity. It's perfect for everyday fare.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"A generous helping of spicy new oak aromas and flavors dominates the taste of this full-bodied, broadly textured wine. Beyond the baking spices, more subtle meaty flavors come out with a second sip.",US-California-Red Blend
"Aromas of burnt orange and baking spices are upright and snappy for a Sherry that's fairly creamy. Fine acidity is what keeps this on an even keel and what gives lift to flavors of caramel, brown sugar and candied walnut. This is full and voluminous on the finish.",Spain-Andalucia-Sherry
"Inky and rustic, yet in a refined manner. This is knock-out juice if you like ’em big and flavorful. The full bouquet of grape, raisin, oak, licorice and herb aromas pulls you in and the follow-up palate of dense blackberry flavors with herb and smoke shadings fulfills the promise the nose makes. Loads of oak here, but there’s great depth of fruit for it to play against. A definite keeper; hold for three or four years at least.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Floral berry and plum aromas are also saucy and oaky, and thus discordant. A wobbly tannic palate with green herbal oaky blueberry flavors tastes grassy on the finish. If you know Casarena's wines, this fits the mold.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Familiar aromas of plum, mulberry, clove and slate show on the nose of this appellation blend by the Paso Robles-based winery. There is decent tension on the sip, where cooked cranberry and strawberry meet with a backbone of allspice and nutmeg as well as bittersweet chocolate.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"While it misses out on the firmer side of the Morgon cru, this is a robust ripe wine. It has attractive red-cherry fruit and juicy acidity. The structure will allow it to age for a few more months, so drink from late 2017.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Lean, dry and minerally, with tart flavors of grapefruit, lemon peel and Asian pear. The acidity is refreshingly crisp. This is a bottling that rarely does well in blind tastings because it's so austere. But it is elegant.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A blockbuster style of Zin from three vineyard sites, all relatively old vine, this is zesty on the palate, a mix of berry compote and cinnamon and black pepper spice. Not too dense, it is hearty and big-shouldered.",US-California-Zinfandel
"The aromas are exuberant, with appealing notes of apricot, pineapple, honey, white flowers and citrus. The citrus and tropical-fruit flavors are rich yet elegant, topped by a lengthy finish.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Aged in 100% new French oak, this wine opens with scents of vanilla and pipe tobacco, but also shows a strong core of ripe raspberries. Mixed berries take over on the palate, softly framed by layers of mocha and vanilla. This full-bodied wine's tannins are creamy in texture, just turning ever so slightly dusty on the long finish. Drink now-2023.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
Odd aromas of bath soap and tropical fruits are not convincing for Chardonnay. A narrow diluted palate offers low-level lemon and tropical-fruit flavors in front of a sour underwhelming finish.,Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"This wine is co-fermented with 12% Petite Sirah, both varieties from one estate block planted to a century-old clone of Teldeschi, a nearby vineyard still in existence. Tart in cherry, red plum and cassis, it's refreshingly unusual and deliciously vibrant. Anise, cinnamon and black pepper round out the finish. The tannins and oak are well-managed and integrated.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Big, fruity, mature wine, showing a petrol character as well as a rounded texture and a shot of minerality. The wine is both chewy and generous, packed with fruit skins and green bean-acidity. It is ready to drink, very fresh.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"Simple, attractive wine, with confected spice, lychee and rounded, warm flavors. Honey and rosehip add interest, with a hint of final pepper.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Made from a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Malbec grapes, aged six months sur lie in barrel, this dry wine has a pleasing ruby color and tannic, woodsy waves of waxy strawberry. It finishes clean and fresh.",US-California-Rosé
"Taking its name from the Chevaliers d'Arce who guarded this land in the 12th and 13th centuries, the small property is now under the watchful eye of Sylviane Garcin-Cathiard. This wine is still young and just balancing out. Firm tannins are shot through with ripe berry fruits and with crisp acidity. It is a wine that is will mature well, so drink from 2019 and consider this property a rising star.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Firmly tannic and powerful, this is dominated by a plum skin texture and a spice note. It's dense and rich, with a dry structure and the acidity of the vintage showing on the finish.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This wine is full in the mouth with a rich, rounded character. Spice balances with the red currant and lemon flavors to give great fruitiness with a more exotic, peppery aftertaste.",France-Provence-Rosé
"A very good Opus with plenty of forward cherries and black raspberries as well as rich notes of spiced oak that give a nougat or crunchy vanilla granola sweetness to the finish. The vintage was not Opus One's best, but the wine is impeccably crafted, and shows its usual fine tannic structure.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa Valley, 10% Cabernet from Sonoma County's Monte Rosso Vineyard and 10% Petit Verdot from Napa, this wine reflects the cool vintage. It offers herb, cedar and peppercorn on the nose along with plenty of acidity and structure. The fruit tends red in cassis and cranberry, finishing juicy.",US-California-Red Blend
"Smooth and fresh, packed with juicy fruit, this is an immediately accessible, young wine. Black currant and plum juice, bright acidity. Drink next year.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This aromatic wine does a great job of combining effusive fruit with a lively balance. Beautiful orange blossom and honeysuckle aromas blend into delicious apple flavors while a tangy, lemon-zest sensation lights up the texture.",US-California-Riesling
"Ripe dark fruit, menthol, tilled earth and underbrush aromas lead the nose along with a balsamic note. The palate is still a bit shy but eventually reveals mature berry, baking spice and a hint of truffle alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink 2019–2025.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Smooth and clean, with a soft, buttery style. This broadly fruity, immediately enjoyable Merlot is clearly intended for near-term enjoyment.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Ripe and jammy, this Cab comes from a vineyard east of St. Helena on the lower slopes of Howell Mountain. The wine is extremely ripe and jammy, with pronounced blackberry, cherry, black raspberry and currant flavors. A little aggressive in fruity sharpness now, it should calm down over the next several years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Solidly in the Saxum style, which is to say a high alcohol (15.5%), massively flavored wine of enormous concentration and power. The blackberry, cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors have all kind of overtones, ranging from licorice and vanilla to gingerbread and candied violets. Saxum has become a cult favorite, one of the highest-priced brands from Paso Robles, and wines like this are the reason why. Drink now and through 2008. Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Fresh and clean, this Vermentino offers ripe aromas of apricot and peach, with background tones of citrus and pear. It's extra smooth and silky on the close.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Vermentino
"Roughly two-thirds Cabernet Franc and the rest Gamay, this is a peppery, tartly acidic red wine. Its sharp-edged berry fruit is braced with lemony scents and acids. Tannins are drying and a bit edgy.",US-Oregon-Red Blend
"This young and fruity wine brings out red berries, soft tannins and spicy acidity. It's a wine to drink now, full of warm flavors and a smooth texture.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This wine pushes the notion of low alcohol, giving soft and subtle an extreme definition. As such, it will not please everyone. Earthy spice and an exotic notion of orange blossom dance around a light, clear body and high-toned minerality. It hails from a foggy, shaded vineyard in Freestone.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a wood-aged wine that brings out the wonderful ripe flavors of the Encruzado. Apricot and ripe Bartlett pears are dominant, backed by some toastiness and with great acidity. This is a finely textured rich wine that is ready to drink.",Portugal-Dão-Encruzado
"Raspberry and cherry aromas are light and pleasing, while the palate exhibits those same friendly and inviting raspberry flavors along with some citrus. A fresh and clean wine, nothing more or less. But it manages to rise above the masses via its focus, length and purity.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Fermented and aged in wood before bottling, this is now a mature wine. It shows some signs of oak, although the toasty flavors have now merged with those of aging. The result is a rich wine, with almond, spice and acidity mingling well together. Drink now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Pretty aromas of fresh-picked raspberries and cherries invite you into this lovely young Pinot. It's fresh as a spring day, with perfect balance and clarity. Drink now through 2018–2020.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"Somewhat thin and acidic in cherry fruit, and also overoaked. It's as if they thought the aromas and flavors of smoky wood would compensate for a simple wine. Lacks richness.",US-California-Grenache
"Made with Malvasia grapes that have been dried for 40 days, this intense, savory dessert wine opens with aromas of dates, dried apricot and a hint of thyme. The persistent aromas carry over to the velvety, concentrated palate, along with candied citrus and orange honey. The long, lingering finish closes on a toasted almond note.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"Produced by the fourth generation of the Dragon family, this delicately pale wine is full and bold in the mouth. Tasting of the sunny 2015 vintage, the soft texture is warm. Acidity is less apparent, lost in rounded strawberry flavors.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Old vines in a field blend give a rich structured wine that has dark tannins and powerful black fruits. It is firm, very concentrated with dense fruit as much as dense tannins. This wine could still age another few months, so drink from 2017.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Stemmler's record is spotty with this bottling. This '05 is a little too ripe, soft and heavy, but the chocolate-inspired red currant, cola and licorice flavors are lip-smackingly good.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Classic aromas of lemon custard, white-peach meringue, toasted oak and roasted nuts show on the nose of this bottling by the Carmel Valley-based producer. The fat lemon-cream flavors meet with savory smoked alder on the sip, with a sea-salt touch leading into the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Starts off decently, with menthol-toast aromas of new oak layered over apple and lime fruit. Then turns overly oaky on the palate, blending caramel, toast and dill flavors with tart apple, finishing off with a slice of lemony acidity.",Australia-Australia Other-Chardonnay
"Heavy oak use is still evident (this wine is from the 2006 vintage so those toasted notes should be integrated by now) and takes away from the natural integrity of the fruit. Spice, tobacco and chocolate appear and the wine ends with fresh crispness.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"The aromas of blueberry, milk chocolate and tire rubber are pleasant enough but the palate distracts with sweet, lightly spritzy blue fruit flavors backed by chalky tannins.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Soft, round and gentle, this has a creamed apple flavor. It has a full, ripe character, with just an edge of green herb and spice.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese White
"Underbrush, dried herb, raisin, saddle leather and balsamic aromas follow over to the ripe palate along with dried cherry, crushed herb and ground clove. Taut tightly wound tannins provide a grippy framework. Give the tannins a few years to unwind then drink to capture the remaining fruit.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Made in a modern, more accessible style, with a stunning nose of mocha, singed meat, roses and coffee. Earth and violets prevail in the mouth and carry over to the long finish. The refined tannin structure tempts early consumption but a few years cellaring will add to the complexity.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Made with skin contact and whole berry maceration to give extra flavor, this is a structured wine with a strong texture along with orange zest and light honey flavors. It is dense and concentrated. Drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Lovely floral scents of violet and iris mingle with dark fruit and a whiff of exotic spice. The elegant, structured palate offers fleshy black cherry, ripe raspberry, white pepper, anise and chopped mint alongside fine-grained tannins. A hint of mocha closes the finish. It's already tempting but hold to let this unwind and fully develop. Drink 2019–2026.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This lighthearted and fragrant expression of Nebbiolo opens with playful notes of cherry cola, blueberry and dusty mineral that give the wine backbone and staying power. Pair it with lamb or pork chops.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"While it has lost its primary fruit, this wine has gained richness, toastiness and structure. Caramel and almond flavors stand out from the firm texture and the concentration. It is a complex wine that has weight and ripeness. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"Castello Romitorio offers a unique expression of Brunello with chalky-mineral characteristics behind bursting cherry and plush fruit. The wine is compact and clean on the palate but offers solid structure, power and a flash of piquant spice on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Powerfully structured and concentrated, this is a rich, tarry and tannic wine. The dense texture doesn't lose sight of the jammy black currant and berry fruits that are just underneath. For the moment, even after four years, the wine is very young, firm and dry. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Dão-Portuguese Red
"This vineyard has been Demeter certified biodynamic, one of just a handful in Washington to achieve that recognition. It's all natural, ripe and full-flavored, with a wonderful, mouthfilling intensity. The flavors are a lovely mix of stone, yeast, flower and a jumble of citrus and apple fruits.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Somehow, Wildhurst manages to keep the price down on their Sauvignon Blanc, which is really refreshing and vigorous. Backed by crisp acidity, this unoaked wine has charming lemongrass, pineapple, fig and peppery spice flavors.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Surprisingly, given that this is the reserve-level red wine in the lineup, it seemed to further accent the herbal nature of the grapes, veering into vegetal. Chewy, sour and rather dull, it's best consumed in the near term.",US-Oregon-Red Blend
"This lightly structured wine is all fruit. Its red berry flavors are already well integrated with the smoky tannins that form its core. It will, however, age quickly. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Smells like a field of wild flowers and weeds on a hot summer's day. There's sweaty leather and rhubarb along with murky, mildly soupy berry flavors. Lacks proper balance and freshness, and instead shows a weedy, sticky side.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Plump and ripe Montmorency cherry kicks off the aromas on this bottling, followed by rain-on-slate minerality, slight hints of cola and a growing sense of sour cranberry. The palate also begins with riper red fruit before diving into extreme minerality and intriguing texture. Then comes tart plums and cranberries, all dusted by savory touches of white pepper. It's quite a ride.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This robust concentrated red is made from an unusual field blend of Sereksiya Charni and Saperavi, two grape varieties more known in Eastern Europe than the United States. It's lush in black-cherry flavor, accented with chocolate, black pepper, vanilla and spice, but also densely tannic and searing in acidity. While unwieldy in its youth, it's a wine that consistently shows excellence with maturity. Hold till 2025.",US-New York-Red Blend
"87-89 Rich, though a wine that seems to lack an inner core. It is all beautiful fruit, super-ripe, laced with acidity, missing the structure.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Blending the earthy elements of the low-alcohol movement with the characteristic ripeness of California fruit, this wine by Trey Fletcher offers rhubarb, wet strawberry leaves, pencil shavings, rose hips, wild berries and anise on the nose. The extremely soft palate shows stewed raspberries, poppy seeds and rose petals, proving unique but varietally appropriate.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Very dark, rich in oak and extracted in fruit, this Cab has enormous flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar. It's a little sharp in acidity all through the finish, which gives it a sting.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Solid tannins, juicy fruits and considerable acidity dominate this wine. It has a fresh character—dry at the back while showing some potential for aging. Spice and final refreshing acidity complete the picture. Drink from 2016.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese Red
"Brisk, citrusy acidity acts as a lever to the raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, lifting them to bright zestiness. The wine is a vintner's blend of barrels from across the large vineyard. There's a jammy directness that makes it instantly tasty, but it's not an ager. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This opens with aromas of ripe black currant, toast, exotic spice and a whiff of roasted pepper. On the concentrated palate, notes of coconut, licorice and black pepper accent a core of dried cherry. Tightly knit, close-grained tannins provide firm support.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend

"This Rhône-style blend is simple and fruity. The flavors of cherry jam, caramel and oak are balanced with acidity and smooth tannins. Sausages are a natural companion.",US-California-G-S-M

"This is a big-boned wine, showy in spearmint and eucalyptus, burly blackberry and tar. With integrated oak and tannin, it presents a respectable showing of approachably lush texture and succulence, the finish persistent in juicy fruit.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"An untamed style of wine, with wild-fruit and ever-so-slight citrus aromatics. It's got a nice full body to it, with some creaminess in the mouth. Proper acids and a good application of oak keep it balanced. Bridgeview has a knack for making well-priced Pinot Noir that's fruity, friendly and complex enough to satisfy those who know and love the grape. This is a perfect case in point.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Voluptuous and a bit brawny, this ebulliently perfumed Gewürztraminer is hardly a wall flower. It's lavishly fruity, bursting of sun-kissed grapefruit, lychee and white-peach flavors. Yielding acidity and a richly dense mouth-filling texture leave a lingering kiss of warmth on the finish. Drink now through 2019.",US-New York-Gewürztraminer
"A bit foxy and jumpy at first, and then familiar aromas of berry and plum settle in. The palate is jammy and tannic, while flavors of berries and currants seem roasted. Tobacco and olive notes are present on the chewy, weighty, textured finish.",Chile-Aconcagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A good Syrah, dry and firm in tannins, although it lacks the richness and structure of Qupe's better bottlings. Shows easy flavors of blackberries, black cherries, cola, funky smoked meat and oak. Drink now.",US-California-Syrah
"This bright, savory wine offers yellow peach, citrus and green melon sensations accented with a light almond note. Crisp acidity gives a refreshing, clean finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Friulano

"This is a jammy, fruit-forward rendition of sparkling Shiraz, with plenty of blueberry and blackberry flavors and a touch of sugar on the finish. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Australia-Australia Other-Shiraz

"A Cab-based Bordeaux blend with a little Syrah, this wine tastes surprisingly cooked for such a cool vintage. There's a raisiny, smoky, baked blackberry and cherry flavor that makes for an imbalance that won't age away.",US-California-Red Blend
"Intense and perfumed, this has high-pitched aromas of rose oil, smoked meat and blackberry. Light, open-knit tannins and juicy acids make for a palate that is accessible and succulent. The acidity becomes more pickled in taste as the wine sits in the glass.",US-Virginia-Red Blend
"Vibrant aromas of lychee, white flowers and spice give way to off-dry fruit flavors, with the concentration seeming a bit light. Still, it delivers a lot of appeal.",US-Washington-Gewürztraminer

"Flavors of pear peel and tart citrus zest on the nose lead to a slightly spicy palate.

It's a very appetizing, just off-dry wine with gentle subtlety.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"This easy-drinking blend of 75% Sangiovese, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot and 5% Malvasia has spice-laced ripe black cherry aromas. The light, simple palate shows sour cherry and clove with soft tannins. Drink soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Heavyweight aromas of molasses and honey are friendly but flat. A dry, drawing palate holds nutty, salty walnut flavors that run only so deep before bottoming out. A tight, basic finish doesn't waver.",Spain-Andalucia-Pedro Ximénez
"Outcrop was planted in 1982. A hint of leather (not too much) along with scents of sassafras and crushed roses, open into a peppery palate with cranberries and red fruits. Ample acidity carries it into a penetrating finish. Drink 2020 through 2035 and beyond.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"The cuvée is barrel fermented, for roundness rather than strong oak flavors. Spicy apple and melon fruit comes with the lightest possible kiss of toast.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Leathery blackberry, vanilla and tobacco aromas include a gritty burnt note that's not entirely welcome. This feels full and oaky, with good balance. Oak-based flavors of vanilla and mocha sit atop black-fruit notes, while this is balanced yet tannic on the finish, with a lingering flavor of vanilla. Drink from 2018–2023.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"The 2015 Estate Chardonnay is a fruit-foward wine, offering bright pineapple and citrus flavors that reverberate on the refreshing finish. On the whole, it is straightforward, with an approachable texture.",Australia-Victoria-Chardonnay

The wine is richly textured and full of ripe fruits. Crisp acidity contrasts with the warm yellow-fruit and ripe red-apple flavors. It is already a refreshing crisp wine with a fine dense texture. Drink from late 2017.,Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"This wine has great potential to emerge as a classic in the years to come, but is a bit tightly wound right now. Hearty roasted plum and blackberry aromas are coated in smoke, chocolate shavings and subtle violet on the nose. The sip starts bright before the strong tannins take hold, hiding the dark berry and minty flavors.",US-California-Syrah
"There are Russian River Pinot Noirs that are dark, heavy and dense, and then there are bottlings like this. It's a silky, light-hearted wine, easy and gentle in the mouth.

"This is the blended Bordeaux from Calvet, one of the oldest wine names in the city. It's full and ripe, a rounded wine that has good berry fruits as well as a drier, firmer core. At the end, a more smoky character appears.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"On the lean side, with a layered concentrated wood structure. The wine has weight along with dryness, although the fruit is harder to discern.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Big and purple, with sweet aromas. But the palate is very uneven, with acute acidity that scours and turns the plum and grape flavors sour. Grabby mouthfeel as well, with clamp.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Merlot

"There is tons of potential for this varietal in the hot eastern reaches of Paso Robles. Light peach and Pink Lady apple aromas start off the easy-to-enjoy nose.

A gravelly minerality and rising texture on the finish complete the picture.",US-California-Verdelho
"This ripe wine comes from organic vineyards in the village of Brochon, next to Gevrey-Chambertin. It shows plenty of structure, a tantalizing smoky character from wood aging and juicy red fruit character. This will be a delicious wine to drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir

"Soapy, funky aromas feel unfocused, with bland flavors of melon and not much else. It finishes soft.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Torrontés

"The wine is rich and concentrated for a Muscadet. With intense fruits and acidity, it is deliciously fruity and crisp. There is a tangy texture that gives the wine zest and minerality. The aftertaste is so fresh and zingy.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"Zesty lemon and lime acidity takes center stage in this invigorating medium-dry kabinett. It's leaner and more linear than the producer's regular-label kabinett, but offers loads of cutting white grapefruit and red apple flavors.

It's closed and tannic now, in the manner of Howell Mountain Cabs, but enormous in ripe black currant fruit, with the power and focus to age for many years. Best after 2009 and through 2017, but only with impeccable cellar conditions.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Portugal's popular brand is a lively, fresh, spice- and dried fruit-flavored wine. There are flavors of pound cake and nutmeg surrounding a core of solid, firm tannins. Great with food, this is not for aging.",Portugal-Alentejo-Portuguese Red
"Lovely notes of ripe apple with an orange peel touch play on the nose. They also appear on the dry, juicy and very fruit-driven palate. All is driven and slender, fresh but ripe. The fruit is so burgeoning that this is still juicy, even on the apple-scented finish.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"From one of the high vineyards on the slopes of the Schrattenthal, this complex Riesling has a fine initial raciness, then opens into perfumed white fruits touched by spice, apricots and a layer of tense minerality. Age for 2–3 years. Screwcap.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Riesling

"Cameron Hughes bottles dozens of wines from California growers, and now he's expanded to include Rioja and Campo de Borja in Spain along with South Africa.

Quite a bulky, oaky style, but also one endowed with chocolate, nuttiness and depth.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Perfumed on the nose with heady yellow florals and stonefruit, this is one stunner of a Riesling. It's powerfully concentrated on the palate with flavors of honey and sweet peach tinged with lanolin and wax. Penetrating and pure in focus, yet remarkably delicate in texture, it finishes long with layers of crushed-stone minerality.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Dry, minty oak aromas mix well with snappy plum and vanilla to form a proper, pleasing bouquet. The palate is fresh, vibrant and houses sweet, slightly spicy plum and berry flavors. Same on the finish, which is correct, spicy and dry.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinto Fino
"A 80-20 blend of Cabernet and Corvina (a native grape of northern Italy), this refreshing red wine opens with a lively ruby color and simple aromas of berry fruit and red rose petal. Pair this wine with picnic foods such as grilled sausage or hamburger.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Red Blend

"This is a supremely earthy and highly tannic wine, leathery and smoky in oak and texture.

This one is worthwhile, showing subtle cassis, cranberry and vanilla.",US-California-Sangiovese

"Château du Cros began life in the 12th century, commanding a superb military vantage point over the Garonne river. The surrounding vineyards have produced a fresh and fruity Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon blend with a mineral bite that gives a strong sense of structure. Its weight and a firm texture act as a foil to the juicy red berries and attractive acidity. The wine is almost drinkable now but will be better from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Forward and bright, with spicy berry fruit, this carries plenty of citrus and a hint of pepper as well. It's done in an easy-going, quaffable style. Give it a slight chill to compensate for the somewhat dull earthy finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"With really ripe fruit and juicy black flavors, this is a rounded, warm wine. It tastes of sun, although there is also something more seriously structured about it. Acidity gives freshness, while the tannic structure suggests further aging. Drink now, but better in 2015.",France-Provence-Red Blend
"This entry level cuvée is finished with a screw cap, and pulled from a mix of barrels and clones from across the estate. It's forward, fruity and big, like an especially bold Beaujolais.

The property is now owned by Bernard Magrez, a wine, art, culture and gastronomy patron.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Kirsten's 2014 Rieslings each share a core of minerality that prevails over primary fruit, but this dry bottling is particularly savory in style. It's refreshingly spry with layers of smoke and chalk notes meandering amidst sheer streaks of fresh, white grapefruit and apple. The finish is brisk and clean.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling

It's beautiful already but likely to improve further from 2021, holding well for at least another decade beyond.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Evidence of a warm vintage is sketched on the bouquet. Aromas of raisin, black licorice and mocha are quite sweet. The palate is wide and mildly tannic, with earthy, oaky black cherry and raspberry flavors. For a ripe wine with significant extraction, it's well balanced. But all along there's a hint of prune that tells you it's ripe and ready.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend

"This is a particularly fine vintage for the popular Dr. Wolfe's, maintaining the customary blend of Primitivo, Lemberger and Petite Sirah.

A dark, dusty mix of black fruits, black olives, black coffee and licorice, this has such density that it's almost impossible to separate out all the fruit layers, let alone the earthier components that make it so distinctive. At 14.8% alcohol, this may be the biggest Betz Boushey Syrah ever.",US-Washington-Syrah

"A good Cabernet, but outclassed in a flight by its more concentrated and attractive competitors.

Could well develop bottle character after 2012, but it's a dice throw.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

Flavors of baked berry, cassis, vanilla and herbs finish peppery and lightly herbal. Drink through 2018.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley-Red Blend

The tannins are substantial, and turn a bit chalky with plenty of skin flavors. Another couple of years of bottle age would be optimal.",US-Oregon-Tempranillo

There is good energy and verve to the sip, which is nearly effervescent at first, then delivers slightly sour watermelon, strawberry and red-plum flavors.",US-California-Rosé

Milk chocolatey tannins roll through the finish, smooth as silk, lingering and luscious.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

It's a wine for aging, wait to drink until 2019.",Portugal-Douro-Touriga Nacional

"Sourced from several different Dundee Hills vineyards, this wraps its black cherry fruit in tart acids, chalky minerals, and a hint of iron.

Hold 10 years or more.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Sometimes an annata Brunello can score higher than the riserva expression from the same vintage.

"This opens with oaky aromas that suggest plastic and milk chocolate, but with airing, shift to berry fruits and mint.

"This is a Zin that needs a warmer vintage to really succeed, and 2005 was cool. It trades the richness of the ‘04 in favor of dried blackberry, tobacco, white pepper and herb flavors. The acid-tannin balance also is more notable. Quite good, but not great. Drink now.",US-California-Zinfandel

"Brander's Sauvignon Blancs are so rich in their own right, they don't even need oak. But when you take a good one, as this is, and add some new French barrels, it becomes even richer.

It's a very nuanced white wine, so do not drink it too cold.",US-California-Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc

"This wine is comprised of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Pinot Noir, 7% Malbec, 2% Petit Verdot and the remainder Syrah and Zinfandel.

"Fermented with 80% whole clusters and aged 18 months in neutral French oak, this outright delicious wine offers aromas of black and green olive, mineral, moist earth and dried herbs.

"Made in a drier, more elegant style than many other Napa Cabs, this polished bottling can be described as Bordeaux-esque. Its blackberry and currant flavors are grounded in a cedary structure of earth and herbs. Great for a wine list. Drink this fine wine now and through 2014.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dilute and watery on the bouquet, with a touch of lime and air freshener. Feels oily and chunky on the palate, with citrus and not too much else to ponder. Lemony and tangy on the finish, with pithy bitterness.",Argentina-Other-Torrontés
"Spiced plum, vanilla, espresso and nutmeg aromas take center stage while the round, enveloping palate offers fleshy black cherry, raisin licorice and clove flavors. Pliant, polished tannins provide smooth support. Drink through 2020.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"Everything about this Tempranillo-led blend rings true. It's full and flush on the nose, with clean berry and snappy tomato and spice notes. The mouthfeel is wiry and bold, with darts of acidity. Flavors span the red-berry spectrum, while the finish condenses in juicy, classy fashion. Drink through 2019.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Yeasty pepperiness and savory spice pervade the lemony core of this zippy Grüner. The body is light but offers interest and refreshment. A very moreish, spicy little number.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"Fermented and aged in new barriques, this deeply golden-colored wine opens with aromas of toasted oak, vanilla bean and oak-driven spices that carry over to the palate. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak and racy acidity, giving it a lean character.",Italy-Tuscany-Vernaccia
"Although sourced from the warm northern end of Barossa, the intention is to make a less bombastic expression of Shiraz, with only 14% new French oak. Mulberry fruit still comes through, accented by hints of coffee, mint and dark chocolate, without too much extraction or tannin. Drink now–2025.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"New wood aromas set the scene for this ripe, fuity and toasty wine. It has plenty of black plum fruit, rich tannins and a dry core that will soften. The texture is polished and ripe. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Scorched earth, dry underbrush and chopped aromatic herb aromas lift out of the glass. The lean palate is rather evolved, showing dried cherry, espresso and a hint of anise alongside fine-grained tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This is sharply herbal, with peppery bitter greens framing tart berry fruit. It's 100% Pommard from 20-year-old vines, but in this chancy vintage the fruit flavors did not get quite fully ripe.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Dominated by Merlot (75%), this is a ripe and smooth wine. At present, the 12-months wood aging shows strongly, leaving behind the black fruits and mineral texture. It's a wine for some serious aging, so don't drink before 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This lightweight wine is dominated by juicy red fruit. Fresh in character, it has bright acids and soft tannins. Not a wine for aging.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine is already showing hints of evolution in its aromas of kerosene, toast and honey. Developing flavors of apple and citrus marmalade suggest that this dry, medium-bodied Riesling should be at its best now and over the next 5–6 years.",Australia-South Australia-Riesling
"This wine has the weight that is typical of this appellation. It is full bodied, ripe with melon and yellow fruits. Contrasting with that, a crisper edge brings out minerality and a nervy texture. Drink from 2022.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Chalky notes of baking soda meet with a nice sizzle of scratched lemon skin, slight bubble gum, fresh sourdough bread and pear blossom on the slightly yeasty nose. Tight lime skins, Asian pear flesh and pink grapefruit cling to a center line of texture and acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a gorgeous interpretation of Aglianico in which the tannic grape is softened and rounded out thanks to quality winemaking. Aromas of chocolate fudge, exotic spice, rum cake and loads of black fruit appear on the bouquet. You will, however, feel that characteristic tightness on the long, drying finish.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"The Beckett brothers show their blending skills in this crisp mix of 41% Grenache Blanc, 37% Viognier and 22% Picpoul, which shows apple blossoms, peach and wet stone on the nose. The palate is solidly crisp and texturally grippy, with fresh-cut melon and lime pith served atop tongue-tingling acidity.",US-California-Rhône-style White Blend
"This accessible Chardonnay is honeyed on the palate with apricot, tangerine, peach and oak flavors. It has good coastal acidity for balance.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Like the Evolution White, this nonvintage blend is labeled by edition, this being the fifth. The blend includes Syrah, Sangiovese, Montepulciano and a splash of Evolution white. It's built for quaffing, and would be just as comfortable in a camp-friendly bota bag as on your dinner table. Cranberry fruit underlined with a strong streak of slate keeps it fresh and lively.",US-America-Red Blend
"Earthy berry aromas are typical of good Carmenère, meaning they are lightly herbal, spicy and a touch savory. This is a ripe specimen from a hot year, so it's plump and creamy in weight. Flavors of blackberry, fig and chocolate are lightly herbal, while the finish is smooth and generous.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"Almost bubbly with a lively mousse, this is a tangy citrus and apple flavored wine that is unfortunately unbalanced with an artificial sweetness at the end.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White
"Very appetizing in a lean style, this light- to medium-bodied wine from a little-known part of Northern California shows dried herb and cranberry aromas, good crisp fruit flavors, medium body and a grippy texture that encourages another sip.",US-California-Sangiovese
"A touch of unripeness gives this wine some steamed broccoli and herb notes, although it also shows plenty of sweet blackberry, cherry and oak. Merlot's smooth softness is present.",US-California-Merlot
"This is a soft, rounded and immediately accessible wine. Ripe apple and crisp green-plum flavors are balanced with a softness from the dosage. Ready to drink, the wine is freshly fruity with a lively mousse and creamy aftertaste.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This very limited reserve is from a particular block, and as with most block selections, it offers focused, somewhat constrained flavors. Precisely defined red berry fruit is set in a frame of vanilla, toast and coffee. It's a pleasant, albeit generic quaffer.",US-Washington-Merlot
"The richness of the aroma belies the elegance of this outstanding Pinot Noir. Tightly woven scents of sweet herb, tobacco, clove, forest floor fungus and spicy red fruits provide an introduction to a wine that can only be called svelte. It's as smooth as silk in the mouth, loaded with flavor and polished to a warm glow, which is exactly what it leaves you with after just one sip.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A rather neutral nose unfolds into fresh, light-bodied citrus on the palate. This is ultralight with lots of lemony zip and a refreshing finish, here and there is a notion of pepper and pear.",Austria-Weinviertel-Grüner Veltliner
"Crisp and bright, this wine has retained plenty of acidity even in this ripe vintage. Attractive and spicy, it offers citrus fruits as well as apricots. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"From the family's Roberts Road Vineyard below Gap's Crown, this earthy, foresty, plummy and gamy wine offers a luscious mouthfeel and silky tannins. Structured, it's built for pairing. A tangy red cherry and citrus twist on the palate provides a refreshing sensibility, before ending bright and light.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is an elegant and stylish wine that's full of lively acidity, red berry fruitiness and soft tannins. The wine is well integrated, with just a touch of gaminess and bright acidity on the finish. It is ready to drink.",France-Provence-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is wood laden, with sweet fruit that compensates for the toastiness. The oak element should integrate well in the next 2–3 years, making for a wine that's soft and sweetly fruity, with smoky acidity.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Hints of ripe peach creep in with the yellow plum notes on the nose. The palate adds a generous if frothy creaminess to these flavors, making them fizz and fill the mouth with their fruity freshness. Behind all this lurks a grown-up backdrop of biscuity richness that allows for a restrained dosage and a very dry finish. Lovely now, will benefit from bottle age. Drink 2016–2019.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"Extremely seductive aromas of caramel, toasted oak, beach campfire, blackberry, black cherry and thin mint cookies welcome the nose to this bottling. The palate is equally complex and inviting, with milk chocolate, cherry pie, smoked pork and dried oregano flavors, tongue-tantalizing all around.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A big, powerful and fruity Chardonnay, made in the classic style of this cool-climate vineyard. It's massive in pineapple, kumquat, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Should develop mineral, nut and dried fruit notes over the years, if you want to cellar it.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Cherry, raspberry and vanilla combine for an inviting mix of ripeness and sweet bouquet. A fruity component also sits nicely atop this structured wine marked by soft, fine tannins. The finish is robust in black pepper and clove.",US-California-Merlot
"Cherry and berry aromas are generic but clean and welcoming. A crisp, fresh mouthfeel is fruity and fairly light for Cab, while flavors of red plum, cherry and red apple skins finish racy and not oaky.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is the Hearst family's run at a luxury-level Chardonnay, and it's a promising start, with creamy aromas of honeysuckle, light butter and citrus rinds. There's a touch of vanilla bean on the palate, which also shows apple ice cream, flashes of cinnamon and a firmly wound texture. It's delicate, clean, light and quaffable.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Ripe forest-fruit aromas are upfront, easily supporting the ample woody spice and toasted character. The palate is fruit-forward, with the black plum core taking center stage to the licorice and anise accents. The fine tannins and juicy fruit flavors make this approachable and enjoyable now.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Pinotage
"Red berry, rose, tilled soil and a whiff of baking spice aromas almost jump out of the glass. The lively palate doles out juicy black cherry, raspberry, clove and orange zest alongside vibrant acidity and supple tannins that give this wine a smooth mouthfeel.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"This Syrah shows the massively extracted flavors that mark Constant's Napa Valley Cabernets. Such an approach works for Cabernet, but on this Syrah, it seems clumsy. It's extraordinarily powerful in blackberry jam, milk chocolate and spice flavors, but it's a little heavy.",US-California-Syrah
"Grassy and almost feline on the nose, with lime and grapefruit flavors, this is a bit simple in some respects, but the power and intensity of this wine make a strong statement that lingers forever on the palate. Distinctive and well worth a try.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a perfumed, citrus and apricot-flavored wine. It is crisp, with a ripe character that fills the mouth with rich fruitiness. It has a light, mineral structure and a long, fruity aftertaste. Drink now.",France-France Other-Vermentino

"From one of Sicily's most beautiful and promising vineyards, Baccante is a blend of Grillo and Chardonnay with bright clean acidity and fragrant yellow fruit. The only setback here is a matchstick aroma (not present in past years) that prevents this vintage from scoring higher.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"Warm and clean seared-apple notes greet the nose on this bottling, with white peach, apple blossom and concrete aromas. The palate is complex, with lemon-skin and herbal lemon-verbena flavors, bound together in tight acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Cheesy oak is the greeting on the nose of this older Malbec from a notoriously tough vintage. After that, earthy, stewed blackberry and meaty aromas come up. This is saturated and a touch stewy, with baked black-fruit flavors as well as gamy animal notes. A dense finish tastes soupy and savory. Drink through 2018.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This is a tasty and interesting medium-bodied wine made from Merlot, Cabernet Franc and a touch of the white grape Viognier. It doesn't overpower with ripeness or tannins, but has a smoky, spicy aroma, meaty flavors and a lively, slightly gripping texture.",US-California-Red Blend
"Focused and salinic, offering mild white-flower and peach aromas, this feels full, round, fleshy and balanced, with pithy citrus, peach and almond flavors that lead nicely to a smooth, melony finish. This is about as complex as Albariño gets.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Mt. Difficulty's Pinots have resisted the trend toward ever-softer textures, even in this, the winery's entry-level bottling. Instead, the wine is firmly structured. Savory, dark-skinned plum fruit is accented by plenty of briary spice. Drink from 2014–2020.",New Zealand-Central Otago-Pinot Noir
"Earthy aromas of leafy underbrush, leather, ripe blackberry, savory herb and baking spice lead the nose on this warm, full-bodied red. The lush, juicy palate offers ripe black plum, fig, black pepper and graphite alongside velvety tannins. A licorice note signals the close.",Italy-Central Italy-Sagrantino

"Aromas of grapefruit, orange peel and chewing gum feed into a wide palate with slightly flat acidity. Melon and papaya flavors finish a bit soft, with a note of stone-fruit pit.",Spain-Northern Spain-Rosé
"Blended from selected vineyards across the Sonoma Coast near Carneros, including the producer's own estate, this wine is made to be approachable and ready to go. It was aged in neutral oak casks, stainless steel and some larger neutral French oak. Herb and mint stand out against a backdrop of rustic black cherry.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A subdued nose carries just a hint of pear fruit. The slender, dry palate gives a little more green pear and fresh zestiness alongside peppery edges of herbs. This is light and easy but has lasting freshness.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"Sensations of dark cherry, cinnamon-spice and a hint of orange peel can't support the searing alcohol that throws this out of balance. Drink now to capture the remaining freshness.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"While the nose is a delicate bouquet of cherry blossoms and raspberries, the palate of this pomegranate-toned wine is kicky and bright. Despite its extended bottle age, it's surprisingly primary still, bristling with tart sour-cherry flavor.",US-New York-Merlot
"Black-fruit aromas are forceful, toasty and gritty. It feels solid, fruity and full bodied, with black fruit flavors that come across ripe and generous. It's oaky but not overly so.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend

"Intensely aromatic, this opens with tantalizing scents of citrus blossom, yellow peach and aromatic herb. The creamy, foaming palate offers apricot, candied tangerine zest, lemon drop and a note of crystallized ginger. Bright acidity and a hint of thyme lift the rich flavors.",Italy-Piedmont-Moscato
"Full bodied and richly textured, this is a lush, velvety Shiraz that nevertheless seems to possess enough structure to age successfully. Cassis, molasses and vanilla all play roles in the aroma and flavor profiles, while a mocha note chimes in on the long finish. Drink now–2025.",Australia-Victoria-Shiraz
"Still tasting quite young, this potent Pinot brings a dark streak of smoke and a splash of citrus to its core black-fruit flavors. The tannins are stiff and carry a hint of stem. Give this some further bottle age, and drink it between 2018 and 2028.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Firm and complex, it manages both acidity and concentrated tannins and brings out really black fruits.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Soft and heavy, tasting like the syrup of a cherry-cola drink. Ready for drinking now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This dry Furmint has aromas of caramelized pineapple, citrus blossom and peach with flavors of apricot, grapefruit and lemon lime. There is pleasant brightness in the crisp finish.",Hungary-Tokaj-Furmint

"Mellow, suave, complex and layered, this wine blends oaky spice flavors with delicious ripe fruit in a harmonious texture. It's medium-bodied, showing generous oak influence and a mouthfeel marked by firm tannins and acidity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Tremendously complex, offering ever-changing elements for the palate to discover. Cherries, raspberries, dusty spices, gingerbread, bacon fat, sweet vanilla, toast, they all flood together. Delicious, but seems a little soft, possibly lacking the structure to age.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The nose on this bottling from longtime Sauv Blanc proponent Fred Brander and winemaker Fabian Bravo is light and delicate, with dried apricot and wet hay aromas, but also tangy, with fresh-cut tangerines. The acidity is evened out on the sip, making for a subtle and pleasant experience full of dried grass, light citrus and Granny Smith apple skin flavors.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Best on the nose, which is floral as it mixes in big black fruit notes and coconut. The palate has a creamy, grabby feel and then confected flavors of carob, vanilla and baked berry. Finishes heavy and very sweet, i.e. syrupy.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Almost as clear as water in the glass, this lively wine from an extreme coastal vineyard shows kiwi, crisp red apple and tons of limestone on the nose. There is lots of fresh energy once sipped, with yellow grapefruit, a touch of smoked Marcona almond and the warmth of sandstone. It continues growing more complex through the sip, leaving the mouth singing.",US-California-Gewürztraminer
"Although new oak accounts for only 10% of the barrels used, the oak influence dominates. Flavors of buttered toast, butterscotch and vanilla ride over the note of pineapple-orange jam. The best thing about the wine is its brisk, clean acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Co-fermented with 5% Viognier, as is typical in all of this producer's Syrahs, this wine offers a wild, feral intensity on the nose of black pepper, cigar box and leather. From there, it softens with well-defined layers of blueberry and blackberry, the tannins settled and structured, the wine finishing in dusty oak.",US-California-Syrah
"Vibrant and fresh with hints of apple, green herbs and blossoms, this off-dry wine boasts a plush, juicy palate full of white peach and lime flavors. It's anchored by a clean line of steely minerality that lingers elegantly.",US-New York-Riesling

"Aromas of raspberry jam, pencil lead and barrel spices are followed by rich, full-bodied fruit flavors that pack a hefty punch. Not for the faint of heart, it shows the power this growing region can bring.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Cinsault, at 53%, is the major player in this soft, tangy wine. It has a good balance of red fruits, citrus acidity and crisp apple. The wine is ripe, poised with an attractively fruity aftertaste.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Perfumed in dried herb and cigar, this is a supple, round, high-toned wine, made from largely Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Dolcetto. Red cherry dominates, almost like a kirsch, while the restrained oak makes it easy to enjoy now.",US-California-Red Blend

"A ripe, spicy wine, with attractive, easy black fruits. It is soft and full, with forward fruitiness and sweet tannins. Very ready, very drinkable.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Very yeasty and slightly clouded in the glass, this wine by regional bubbly pioneer Norm Yost shows buttered plums, rising sourdough bread and freshly picked scarlet red rose petals on the nose. The mouthfeel is noticeably creamy, with more bready yeast, citrus peels and hints of hibiscus and jasmine.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Opens with a pretty shade of gold that denotes more sophisticated extraction and in fact that impression is carried through to the nose and mouth where the wine exhibits ripe fruity aromas, honey, almond skin, dried herbs and natural rubber. The mouthfeel is thin, but remains a step above the commercial Pinot Grigio that is so commonly available. The wine is packaged with a real vine clipping around the bottle neck.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Honeysuckle, ripe pear and exotic fruit aromas take center stage. The bright, juicy palate doles out honeydew melon, white peach and nectarine flavors with lively acidity, finishing on an almond note.",Italy-Lombardy-Turbiana
"Moderate in structure, full bodied and ripe, this wine is tightly wound in firm, strong tannin. Light flavors of cherry and orange integrate spiky accents of clove, tea and dried herb.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Managing to be both brisk and rounded on the nose, this bottling by veteran Rick Longoria shows ripe nectarine, sea salt, white peach and lime rind aromas.

Excellent now, but will drink excellently all the way through 2024.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Salvo Foti is a winemaker to watch. A foremost expert and advocate of Sicily's Etna terroir, he has shaped a delicate and feminine wine with a Burgundian style. The wine is very floral with blue violets and lavender and polished aromas of cinnamon and crisp apple.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"This appellation blend from Bryan Babcock is flamboyant on the nose, showing lime blossom, honeysuckle, wet cement and peach aromas. There's a great sizzle of acidity and pithy grip to the palate, supporting its strong stone fruit flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay

"From vines on the plateau to the west of the village of Saint-Émilion, this is a light, fruity wine. Its acidity and tannic structure lend a crisp texture to its black currant fruit. It will probably broaden as it matures, so drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"From a site planted by Steve MacRostie in 1998, this white sings in complexity and tension, providing tart jolts of lemon verbena, ginger and nutmeg. Complex and elegant, especially in its floral perfume, it drinks voluptuously, full of come-hither ripeness.",US-California-Chardonnay

"This is a monster Zin, and a very good one. It has an inky black color tinged with red, strong dried-fruit flavors like fig, prune and dried cherry. Along with a smoky, roasted quality on the palate, it has sandy tannins with lots of grip. Powerful and almost sweet.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Rates about the same as the winery's reserve bottling due to grassy, green aromas of prickly raspberry. Big, chunky and sort of awkward on the palate, with herbal, rooty flavors. Burns on the finish with heat and spice.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Pinot Noir
"94–96. Barrel sample. This is a ripe, wonderful wine that's full of spice, pineapple and apricot with a green tang of herbaceous character. It's simply beautiful, with great style and a deceptively simple use of wood.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend

"The oak sticks out on this Pinot Noir, with a dominating toast aroma and flavor. The underlying wine, however, bears strong notes of red fruit and currant. Give it 2–3 years to see if the balance shifts.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Full-bodied and firmly structured, this smells a bit peppery and roasted, then gives up dried cherry and blackberry flavors that fill the mouth and taste generous and soothing. It has benefited from the extra age since bottling, and is ready to enjoy.",US-California-Merlot
"This négociant-style wine offers immediate appeal. Aromas of lemon, candle wax, mineral, lees and toast are followed by lively, sleek citrus flavors. This was a banner vintage for Washington whites and this wine is batting cleanup.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Dense blackberry and black cherry notes pick up soy, oregano, thyme and roast beef characteristics in this very dark style of Zin. The deep and rich palate offers concentrated black cherry syrup before revealing rustic touches of leather and tobacco. A hearty wine to match your roasted meats.",US-California-Zinfandel
"While toast and spice are prominent on the nose, oak notes integrate elegantly on the palate of this plush, full-bodied Bordeaux-style blend. It's juicy and fruit forward, with soft, chalky tannins showcasing sultry, ripe cassis and blackberry flavors.",US-New York-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Lightly honeyed, this off-dry wine is complex while also fruity. Intense flavor fills the mouth with spice, yellow fruits, pineapple and a touch of mango. The fruits are balanced by the more nuanced honey and spice character that is finished with acidity. Gros Manseng, a native grape of this region, is worth getting to know. Drink this delicious wine from 2016.",France-Southwest France-Gros Manseng
"Try this rare wine from a vineyard planted in the 1880s. Aromas like maple syrup and vanilla, and flavors like raspberry and cherry jam make this wine seem sweet and feel soft as a pillow, but understand that the alcohol level is almost high enough for a Port.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Light aromas of lemon, apple, pineapple, toast and spice lead to just off-dry flavors. It drinks a little sweet for a brut but still delivers enjoyment—a straightforward crowd pleaser.",US-Washington-Sparkling Blend
"A good everyday wine, tannic and dry, with flavors of herbs, ripe berries and currants, and savory spices. The seven-variety blend starts with Merlot and ends with Petite Sirah.",US-California-Red Blend
"This smells a bit stalky, leathery and warm at first, but airing brings it along. While it's never all that vivid on the nose, it does smell of baked berry and plum. It feels wide and neither tannic nor tough, with lightly herbal, rustic flavors of plum and berry.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This charming wine has a bright character, showing notes of juicy wild cherry, mint and eucalyptus and accents of leather and truffle. Drink now or wait a few years for tannins to tame down.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This wine is made in the style of the winery's marvelous Finch Hollow Chardonnays, but is just a little less concentrated. Dry, crisp and elegantly clean, it has complex, mineral-infused flavors of tangerines, peaches and limes, enhanced with lots of smoky new oak. It should hold in the bottle through 2016.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Very dry and tannic now, although soft, with ripe flavors of blackberries and black currants that verge on overripe ones of prunes and raisins. This blend of Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon does not seem likely to improve.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"The merest touch of lemon appears on the nose. The palate is equally reticent, only gradually revealing a touch of orange blossom and apple peel around a very lemony, bright, linear core. This has concentration but no heaviness, there is depth and toned muscle. The finish is dry and alluring, focusing on that lemon purity with a lovely earthy edge of apple peel. Drink 2019–2030.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Overt and delicious oak aromas and flavors dominate this full-bodied, tannic wine. It smells like fresh-cut oak boards and tastes like cinnamon, cardamom and black cherries, finishing with lingering tannic grip.",US-California-Tannat
"This medium-bodied Merlot shows as much mineral as it does oak over its sturdy mixed-berry fruit. Spice, green-herb and resin notes add interest to the nose; chalky tannins linger on the finish. 30,000 cases produced.",US-California-Merlot
"Dineen and Red Willow 'Les Vins de Marcoux' supply the fruit for this complex, aromatic Syrah. A fecund melding of compost, chicken yard and chocolate accents surround a core of berries and cherries. Ripe, round and mouth-filling, it's not at all overpowering, but has the style and complexity to hold your interest through the entire bottle.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Unlike most Dolcettos, this is laid back; it doesn't announce itself with a great blast of fruit. Instead it offers a package of spices and blackberry jam throughout the palate. No great intensity here but there is an easy elegance to the wine, culminating in a solid, medium finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto
"Delicious flavors of cola, cherries, raspberries, rose tea, orange peel, vanilla and smoky sandalwood merge in this single-vineyard Pinot Noir, and it's nicely dry, with a silky-smooth texture. Give it a good decant before serving, as it gets better as it breathes.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A pale-colored rosé, fresh and very dry, this is crisp and light. Attractive raspberry and red currant fruits are cut by acidity. The tangy texture is lively and crisp.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Generosity, expressed by the scent of sun-ripened Bosc pear peel, becomes immediately apparent. The ripe and luscious pear aromatics pervade the palate with their fruity, almost floral charm. There is some residual sweetness, boosting these flavors even more, but balance is struck by shining freshness and a pear-peel texture to finish with beguiling freshness. This is textbook stuff and utterly moreish.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"This is a well-made wine, correct in all respects but decidely light for a Cabernet Sauvignon, perhaps a reflection of the difficult 1998 (La Niña) vintage. However, its attractive flavor package and appraochable structure make for easy drinking with tonight's pasta or pizza.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This opens with aromas of orchard fruit, citrus and toasted bread crust. The firm palate offers lime, vanilla, oak and yellow apple skin alongside bracing acidity. A note of bitter almond marks the finish.",Italy-Lombardy-Sparkling Blend
"Tightly wound on the nose, this wine eventually releases blackcurrant and blueberry fruit along with aromas of black rock and turned earth. The palate is dense with black peppercorn, char and asphalt, lifted by hints of violet. Since the structure is dense and tannic, it will be fun to watch this wine emerge over the years.",US-California-Syrah
"Strawberry jam, espresso, toast, menthol and dark spice lead the nose. The straightforward, rather lean palate offers dried cherry, star anise and a hint of tobacco alongside firm, fine-grained tannins that grip the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This is a rich and juicy wine, balancing the firm tannins of the Baga with richer fruitiness of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz. It is still young, still showing layers of firm tannins although with plenty of development potential. Drink from 2017.",Portugal-Bairrada-Portuguese Red
"This 100% varietal wine comes from Conner Lee, Sagemoor and Klipsun vineyards. Already six years old, it's near full-bloom with aromas of dates, blackberry pie, dried herbs and spice. The black fruit flavors are full bodied and dense. Drink up.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Bonnet was this family's winery in 1744. André Lurton took over in 1953 and in 2015, the third warmest year since 1900, his team created a wine with tropical fruits, mango and pineapple. This give this wine its ripe, perfumed character. It does have a crisp side as well, fresh with apple and citrus. The balance is just right, giving a refreshing, ready-to-drink wine.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This is a rich, wood-aged wine with spice, apricot and ripe plum fruits and a mineral texture. It is rounded as well as fresh, crisp with acidity while full in fruits. Drink this delicious wine now.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese White
"Floral, young and jumpy smelling, with gumball aromas that leave you with the impression that the wine's clarity, balance and purity may be tenuous. The palate is raw but fresh, with simple but snappy wild berry flavors. Not a lot of structure or depth here.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"More oak and color than the regular Calina Merlot, but that means more coconut, resin and char as well. Black raspberry and currant-like flavors are plump and medium-long, while the finish has some tannic grab and girth along with woody touches like vanilla and spice. With 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Chile-Maule Valley-Merlot
"Floral and in balance, this estate-grown wine is bright and light in cherry and raspberry, layered and velvety on the palate. It finishes in a fist of leather and black pepper.",US-California-Syrah
"A little earthy, with plummy aromas accompanied by sun-dried tomato, rhubarb and hard spice notes. The flavors are along the same lines, with cherry tomato, coffee and spices. It's very dry, and finishes with a slightly dusty, tannic bite.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This sparkling wine, made entirely from Chardonnay, offers aromas of yellow flowers, oak and lemon peel. The palate shows evident oak, buttery sensations, apricot and citrus. The finish releases notes of bitter almond.",Italy-Lombardy-Chardonnay
"This block selection strikes a good balance between forward fruit, spicy barrel, tangy acids and a textural, lingering finish. It's medium bodied and well balanced, with a finish that leaves an impression of astringent tannins.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of Mediterranean scrub, violet, wild berry and a whiff of menthol lead the nose on this bright, easygoing red. The racy, straightforward palate offers sour cherry, pomegranate and a hint of star anise alongside zesty acidity and smooth tannins. A blast of orange closes the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"The apricot notes of Viognier come through strongly with this smooth, ripe wine. It has a steely character and a cool freshness from the Arinto and Síria in the blend. All in all, an attractive wine that could age a few months.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese White
"Very similar to Peju's regular '05 Cab Franc, released a few months earlier, except it tastes much oakier. You'll find the soft structure and cherry, currant and violet flavors, but the toasty oak and caramel are overwhelming.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Intense aromas of lemon, lime, tropical fruit and white flowers lead the nose. On the slightly sweet palate, a hint of aromatic herbs offsets green apple, kiwi and citrus. It closes on a note of candied nectarine zest.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Creamy vanilla and fig combine around a thick texture complemented by bright, consistent waves of ripe tangerine. The finish is short, filled in by more citrus.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"The idea here is to present a more structured and sophisticated Brut with emphasis on the nutty tones and mature peach. The wine succeeds in this regard but the whole point of Prosecco is to be light and fun; this ultimately lacks those sharp, well-defined fruit tones you might expect.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"A small percentage of outside grapes is added to the blend for a creamier and richer expression of Prosecco Superiore. Creamy and rich, this delivers a distant softness. The mouthfeel is enhanced by flavors of peach, citrus and honey.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Aromas of scorched earth, leather, ground pepper, porcini mushroom and mature berry lead the nose. The aromas carry over to the ripe palate along with raspberry jam, vanilla and chocolate. It's already accessible. Drink through 2023.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Ripe flavors of apple and pear highlight this expressive and easy-drinking wine. It's medium bodied and solidly built, with a hint of graham cracker running through the finish.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Lovely scents of red berry, wild flower and baking spice lead on this elegant red. The radiant palate has tantalizing depth, offering layers of cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, nutmeg and licorice. Silky tannins and fresh acidity give it an almost weightless texture.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"This shows the softness and red cherry flavors of a nice Merlot, with rich Napa tannins and a hint of green mint. It's a clean, dry wine for drinking now.",US-California-Merlot
"This is an intriguing and unique wine with individual elements that are hard to pin down, but worthy of attention. The Portuguese varietal-led blend shows deep black plum, pencil lead, black cherry and cola on the slightly grapy nose. Cola, root beer and black cherry arise on the thick and chewy palate, which finishes slightly sour.",US-California-Red Blend
"There's a sweetmeat, salty leatheriness to this Pinot, like beef jerky. Give it a year or so to mellow out and let the smoky oak integrate with the ripe cherry, cola and raspberry flavors. Decant for an hour or two if you pop it open now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Inky-ruby colored, this wine has a complex bouquet of strawberry, watermelon, chocolate, violet and bell pepper. There is a nice interplay of fruit and cool herb notes, featuring flavors of black cherry, orange zest, eucalyptus and mint. A strong but subdued network of tannins recedes at the finish, making way for a pleasing jolt of bright acidity.",Israel-Judean Hills-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is rich and dense with blackberry, cassis liqueur and cedar flavors. It's frankly delicious, but those tannins are really hard—that's Diamond Mountain for you. Will be more mellow in 6–7 years, but it's fine now with a nice steak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"In this pale rosé, freshly cut orange and papaya mousse aromas are cut with a bit of flintiness. The wine plays to the citrus side of the pink scale, with lemon rind and pink grapefruit flavors. It's a bit more watery than other rosés of the vintage.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"While subdued on the nose, this offers tart red cherry and currant flavors that are refreshing and crisp on the palate. The wine is not deeply concentrated or complex, but its elegant frame and vitality are attractive.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"Fruity and spritzy, this fragrant, screwcapped Chardonnay is scented with apples, pears, a hint of grapefruit and spice. It's front-loaded, nicely balanced at 13% alcohol, and best enjoyed lightly chilled.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"The very ripe and sweet cherry aromas and flavors bear handsome notes of tarragon and smoke. Full and round on the palate, this wine displays a lengthy finish with dark cherry, bitter-chocolate and herb flavors. Quite appealing now and very easy to get comfy with.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This full-bodied wine smells like black currants and blackberries, tastes ripe, and is lightly tannic to give it a little grip. Bring on the beef or pork tenderloin.",US-California-Red Blend
"An unusually bright-gold color and aromas like vanilla and nutmeg signal a complex style for this unusually textured and nicely viscous wine that is technically light bodied in terms of alcohol. Balanced out by good acidity, it is not overtly fruity but goes for complexity and spiciness that linger on the finish.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"The nose on this regularly solid Verdejo is mild, with aromas of apple, pear and melon. The palate is round and a touch fleshy, with modest acidity pushing pithy peach and pear flavors. The finish tastes of almond skins and apple.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"A completely different blend from the winery's 2006 Ciel, this reflects Chris Camarda's growing enchantment with Cabernet Franc, which is now 45% of the blend. Most of the rest is Merlot—a Right Bank style. The concept works. It captures the sleek minerality of the site, and puts the fruit into tight, laser-like focus. The wine seems almost crystalline—sharp-edged and reflective, with penetrating angles and offset flavors.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"There's a wild character to the nose of this lean, tart Pinot. It offers aromas and flavors of game, sour cherry, tart raspberry and red currant, framed by soft tannins and a fleeting finish.",France-France Other-Pinot Noir
"This boasts alluring scents of Spanish broom, lychee and orchard fruit. The creamy elegant palate delivers mature pear and grilled herb while a juicy nectarine note closes the linear finish. Drink through 2020.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"Exotically spiced mulberry and red currant aromas meet sumac, clove and sweet rose petal scents on the nose of this bottling from a promising new project by Jennifer Hoage. The palate blends dried sage, juniper and pine needle flavors with cherry and red plum fruit, showing complexity but a light texture.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Light in color, almost rusty. Fleshy aromas of chunky, brambly fruit also offer a lot of pepper, both black and green. With good body and texture, you’re hopeful for more in the mouth, but the fruit is marred by the essence of veggies, even tasting a bit stewed.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Hints of dried thyme and bay leaf accent this wine's bouncy, upfront red-fruit notes. It's medium bodied, with softly dusty tannins and crisp acids that give shape to the palate and persist through the finish. Drink now and over the next year or two.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Blueberries and blackberries are the dominant themes here, with some smoky notes playing a supporting role. Bright, tart and fruity, this doesn’t appear to have the depth for aging. But it is an immensely attractive wine for early quaffing. There are some slightly drying tannins on the finish, so try it with rich or fatty foods for best effect.",France-Rhône Valley-Syrah
"Easy, thin and watery, this ruby-colored Valpilicella has the natural crispness to pair with pizza with sausage and mozzarella. There's a touch of bitter almond on the close that would be nicely offset by sweet butter or cheese.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This has flavors of oranges, Meyer lemons and tropical fruits, and there's a good burst of acidity that lends balance. The finish tastes a bit sweet. Pair this selection with Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai, Indian or Ethiopian dishes.",US-California-White Blend
This is an unusually toasty Pinot Blanc. Wood flavors add another dimension but cover the natural spice and fruit of the grape.,France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
The organic wine has tight tannins and acidity. The structure is balanced by red-currant fruit flavors. The wine is vinified under the direction of Michel Rolland and one of several family wineries under Bacchus Investments. Drink from 2018.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Fragrant notes of tangerine and yuzu peel abound on this citrusy dry Riesling. The palate is cutting and fresh, full of juicy white grapefruit and lime flavors. Light bodied yet satisfyingly thirst quenching, it finishes long with invigorating minerality.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"This big, hearty and almost meaty wine is full bodied. An earthy/savory thread in the flavor adds complexity and distinguishes this bottling from the field of simply fruity and ripe wines.",US-California-Primitivo
"Aged 10 months in 25% new American oak, this pleasantly oaky wine delights with its complexity and overall balance. Pineapple, peach and citrus fruits are complemented by notes of coconut (there's that American oak) and hazelnut. Firm acids bring further citrus highlights to the finish.",Canada-British Columbia-Chardonnay
"Grapefruit peel, salty miso and white pepper create a savory and appetizing nose. The palate is slender and zippy, full of these spicy notes and enlivened by fresh lemon and green pear. It's a wonderfully easy but exciting Grüner: light but authentic, with lasting pepperiness.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"On the austere side, this shows more tannin than fruit, based around a dry core that has spread through the wine. There is some black plum skin and black currant fruit, but it is hard to find.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Bringing together old vines from a number of the Chablisienne cooperative's vineyards, this wine is concentrated and finely structured. Its rich creamed apple and tangy orange zest flavors are lit by acidity and a mineral edge. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This is a bold ripe wine that is dominated by firm while juicy Tannat. Named after the characteristic black berets worn by the menfolk of Gascony, the wine is powerful and dense with black fruits and balanced acidity. Drink this already enjoyable wine now, or better from 2018.",France-Southwest France-Red Blend
"This is cedary and dry smelling, with more spice than fruit aromas. It feels crisp, tight and acidic, with flavors of raspberry, red plum and forced spice coming from the heavy oak. Dry, oaky and spicy on the finish.",Spain-Central Spain-Tempranillo
"This is a dominated by new wood, but it still retains fragrant, fresh fruit. A touch of lemon pairs with the toast note, bearing refreshing acidity on the finish.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Sometimes a wine has such a distinct individual personality that it stands out from the crowd, and this focused Pinot fits that description. There is a light touch of sophisticated, subtly spicy French oak but a crystal-clear raspberry fruit character energizes the aromas and flavors. It is medium-to-full bodied, but not at all heavy. It's hard to imagine tiring of this.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Pale in color, this light-bodied Pinot Noir is appropriately supple in texture and offers modest berry and chocolate notes. The finish is surprisingly long, but a bit lemony. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"A great entry-level Riesling, fresh, floral and delicate, the Two Vines offers refined, even subtle flavors of green apple and melon, with lovely natural acidity. Despite considerable residual sugar, it does not seem overly sweet.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Hard and crusty on first impression, with smoky, leathery, meaty aromas along with hints of wild herbs and dark berry fruit. Feels racy and ultraslick, with cherry, plum and mineral flavors. Hits all the right notes while not pushing any buttons too hard or too often; long on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"This is soft and generously fruity wine. It has spice, ripe red-berry fruits and just enough tannin to give structure. Touches of chocolate and bitter coffee are rounding out well to allow the fruit and ripe texture to speak. Drink from 2017.",France-Provence-Provence red blend

Nuits Saint-Georges is the home of the Aegerter family and its Domaine. This ripe spicy smoky wine is rich both from the vintage and from the core of tannins that are typical of the appellation. It is a smooth rounded wine although it will need some aging. Drink from 2020.,France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This off-dry Riesling boasts pretty fresh apple and floral notes on the palate, but persisting notes of dried herbs and spring ramps distract. Sprightly on the palate with delicate lemon acidity.",US-New York-Riesling
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Merlot delivers warm tones of mature berry fruit with nice earthy renderings and a determined, mineral-driven backbone. Delicate aromas of berry fruit and dried violets are backed by deep spice flavors and firm tannins that are slightly on the green side.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"Light and clean, this is a gentle take on Pinot Noir, comparable to a modest Bourgogne from a big shipper such as Bouchard. The alcohol rests comfortably at 13.5%, and the wine is done in a fruit-forward, drink-now style that fits the price point.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Perfectly differentiated from the winery's equally excellent Pinot Blanc, this is a bit fleshier, with fresh flavors of apple and pear. The texture, mouthfeel and mineral-drenched acids all flow into a mouthwatering finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Mint aromas speak of the wood used in aging this wine. With some burnt tannin character, it's perhaps not a wine that will show great fruit.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"If you want a truly herbal, grassy wine, look no further. This wine is tight, crisp and green with juicy green-plum acidity. It is forward, all fruit with just a tang of texture at the end. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc

"This is Longboard's most successful of three 2010 Syrahs. It comes from the winery's estate Westside Road vineyard, whose vines now are acquiring some age. It's a complex wine, dry, full-bodied and tannic, with blackberry, currant, tobacco, grilled prosciutto, mineral and pepper flavors that finish long and satisfying. Drink now–2016.",US-California-Syrah
"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, with 25% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, is complex and intriguing. It boasts a full profile of ripe fruit tones, expressed in layers of baked cherry, plum and rhubarb cake that are accented by notes of cured bacon, leather and pressed purple flowers. The palate is surprisingly smooth and silky, thanks to resolved, approachable tannins and a lingering sweet-smoke hit on the finish.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Swathes of floral and berry tones accent this blossomy blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. It's aggressively foamy and frothy, but racy, vivacious acidity keeps the palate fresh.",US-New York-Sparkling Blend
"Scents of sweet-cream butter, vanilla and stonefruit are enticing on the nose of this richly textured, medium-bodied wine. The palate boasts hints of sweet lemon curd and fresh apple, but the slightly-sour oak notes can be overwhelming.",US-New York-Chardonnay

"Black pepper, lavender, blueberry, blackcurrant, grapseseed and smoked game make for a heady nose on this wine from a property just south of the Sana Ynez River. The palate offers tart black fruit and elderberry jam, with just enough pepper and purple flowers to round out the sip.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"This mature wine is a touch gritty and baked on the nose, and the palate has some scratch and choppiness to the mouthfeel. But core flavors of stewed berry, baked plum and cherry are good, and the finish of molasses, brown sugar and ripe berry fruit has its merits. Drink now.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Black as night, it offers classic characteristics. Oodles of black pepper on the nose and palate are seasoned over soft, lush tannins and hearty layers of licorice, dark chocolate and coffee. It's ready to enjoy now but will also grow gracefully over many years.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Apple and lemon rise above the fray in this crisp and tartly fresh sparkler. Nicely integrated acidity keeps it vibrant on the palate, and lengthy on the finish, all within a lightly ripe context of deliciousness.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Mossy, lightly herbal aromas of blackberry and marzipan are attractive. This is rich, loud and racy in the mouth, with vanilla, tobacco, plum and berry flavors that finish long and ride elegantly on a beam of slightly sharp acidity. Drink this fine Carmenère through 2016.",Chile-Peumo-Carmenère
"Some may find this coastal SB to be too green and vegetal, but that's cool-climate Leyda in a nutshell. Aromas of bell pepper and asparagus bring on the pyrazines, while in the mouth, this is spritzy and chunky. A reprise of green, pyrazine-driven flavors finish fresh but slightly bitter.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Like some of the other 2008s, this wine seems to be evolving rapidly—a common enough occurence in hot vintages. Apple and citrus flavors still dominate, but the wine is already showing hints of honey and toast. Drink it now and over the next 3–5 years.",Australia-South Australia-Riesling
"For one of their lower-priced bottlings, this blend of 55% Grenache, 40% Mourvèdre and 5% Cinsault is a great deal. The nose shows exuberant black raspberry, scarlet rose petals and fresh lilacs against a backdrop of dewy thyme and oregano. That herbal component carries strongly to the palate, giving nuance to tangy plum fruits. The savory touch would pair with everything from pasta to Asian-spiced beef.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"A success despite a certain leanness, a young wine in need of mid-term cellaring. Notes of of green olives, bacon, unsweetened dark chocolate, and boysenberries are wrapped in sumptuous, lush tannins that melt on the palate. This bone dry wine needs rich meats.",US-California-Merlot
"A bouquet of spicy cinnamon and clove opens up this tightly woven wine, with perceptible tannins and rustic leather-bound elements to the nose and palate. With noticeable acidity and a crispness of cranberry, it develops an intensity on the finish, along with a taste of dried cherry.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Biodynamically farmed Momtazi Vineyard is a favorite of several high-end Willamette Valley producers.

It's silky and sensuous, with blue plum, black cherry, dark chocolate and notes of earth and iron.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"The majority of grapes within this red are grown in Yountville and certified organic. Simple aromatics make way for a touch of reduction on the nose, while flavors of brushy sage, cedar and clove offer more spice than fruit. Sharp tannins lie beneath.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A classic, structured, well-shaped Port with its attractive dry tannins and firm, dark berry fruit. There's excellent balance between the fruit and the sweet spirit character, which goes right through this serious wine.",Portugal-Port-Port

"This tangy, all-stainless, lightly grassy, dry Sauvignon Blanc is a pure and definitive elaboration of the grape's varietal character. Penetrating and crisp, it would be hard  to ask for more from a $9 wine.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"A nod to the winery's co-owner Judge Royce Lewellen, this bottling is full of campfire smoke, red cherry, hibiscus and roasted pork aromas. That smoky character, which is pleasant if a tad overbearing, follows through to the palate, accenting the plum and black pepper flavors.",US-California-Merlot
"There is weight here, and some extraction. The wine feels fleshy, full of juicy ripe green and white fruits. There is pepper, spice and the ripest of green plums. A definite food wine. Screwcap.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"This robust red opens with scorched earth, new leather, underbrush and dark spice aromas. The palate is brawny and monolithic, offering licorice, dried cherry and clove flavors with the warmth of evident alcohol. It's framed by chewy tannins and should be drunk soon to capture the remaining fruit and freshness.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre is unbalanced. It's sweet in dessert red berry fruit, with an awkward streak of acidity.",US-California-G-S-M
"A lovely Cabernet, rich and pure and quite frankly delicious. Although it shows those famous mountain tannins, they're softly refined and entirely drinkable now, letting the blackberry, chocolate, violet and mineral flavors come through.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The cocoa, herb and woodspice aromas are still quite locked up. The black cherry flavors are more revealing, showing a pleasing tartness and sense of elegance.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"With vines in the northeast of the Gers region, this winery produces impressively ripe red wines. This wood-aged and spicy wine is still young and needs time to integrate the wood with the red berry fruits. It does have weight and potential richness, so give it until 2016.",France-Southwest France-Red Blend
"With 15 months in French oak, this blend of 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache starts off rich and lavish, as creamy mocha notes infuse the deep plum, blueberry and black cherry fruit core.

Drink now–2015.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rhône-style Red Blend
"With ripe, spicy fruit, this is a concentrated, dense wine. It has young, firm tannins that are beginning to integrate with the juicy black fruits and fine, perfumed acidity.

"This medium-bodied effort comes across a slightly crisp and lacking in richness, but nevertheless delivers ample raspberry and cherry fruit before ending with some slightly tough tannins. Drink now with grilled meats, or hold through 2017 and see if it mellows a bit.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Immensely inviting, this opens with fragrant pipe tobacco, crushed berry, new leather and pressed violet aromas. On the palate, firm, refined tannins underpin juicy black cherry, raspberry and cinnamon flavors, while orange zest accents and an energizing mineral note lift the finish. It's beautifully balanced with bright acidity and will reward a bit of cellaring. Drink 2020–2032.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Aromas of green melon and pear are calm like a lake with no breeze. This feels mildly creamy, while leesy briny melon and peach flavors turn somewhat bitter prior to a soft easy finish that doesn't sing but doesn't fall off.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Nerello Mascalese, a grape native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna, delivers fresh berry notes that recall raspberry, blueberry and mulberry backed by toasted almond. There are pretty mineral nuances woven within its texture and the wine ends with polished tannins and menthol freshness. It is aged 12 months in oak, but you hardly taste the wood.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nerello Mascalese
"Only very subdued notes of citrus emerge and add a little polish to a rounded, balanced and dry palate. However, a lovely, bundled ray of tangerine zestiness at the core brightens the wine immensely.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris

"This is a bold, fruity wine with ripe tannins and a touch of toast. This toastiness needs to soften to fill out the palate with the red-berry fruits and acidity. The tannic core is dry, firm and solid, offering aging potential. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This vineyard-designate Valpolicella blend opens with soft tones of milk chocolate and cherry backed by mesquite wood and barbecue smoke. It's a soft, luscious wine that would pair with grilled beef or pork.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Excessive sweetness mars this wine, making the blackberry flavors dull.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"If you liked the winery's far more expensive “1772” bottling of Syrah, you'll find an approximation of it here, at about half the price. Dry and balanced, with typical Edna Valley acidity, it's marked by black cherry, red currant, licorice, chocolate-covered mint and peppery spice flavors.",US-California-Syrah
"While this Pinot has gorgeous, generous raspberry, cola, mushroom and sweet oak flavors, it also possesses a superb structure of tannins and acids that makes it successful. In that sense, it's a masterful balance of power and elegance, and is distinctly Pinot Noir-esque in its silky texture. Drink now–2017, depending on your taste for older Pinot.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Round and fruity, this mixes sweet berry with red plum and Bing cherry. Orange-peel highlights lift the midpalate. The wine shows excellent balance and a detailed, lingering finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"There's unique sharpness to the chaparral spice on the nose of this bottling, where black sage meshes into rooty flavors of beet and rhubarb as well as violets and black tea. That Earl Grey tea component pops on the earthy palate, where baked black plum and black raspberry are laid across a base of dried purple flowers and pine-laden forest floor.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"On the nose, this is challenging: gaseous, oaky aromas of wet cement also contain notes of bitter lettuce, baking spices and general grit. Raw, tannic and abrasive on the palate, this unfolds to offer herbal flavors of berry and plum. Tannic, scratchy, rugged and mildly green on the finish.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Very pretty aromas of rose, violet and perfumed berry lead the nose on this concentrated wine. The juicy palate offers blackberry, black cherry, licorice and white pepper alongside lithe, polished tannins and bright acidity. The succulent finish closes on a mineral note.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"A tiny bit of Mourvèdre and Barbera are added into the blend, but this is honest and true to varietal Washington Syrah, with strawberry and cherry candy fruit flavor in abundance. Initially forward and light on the palate, it moves into more herbal, earthy flavors in the finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Broad, ripe berry aromas are dark and full on the nose. The palate is lively, with a shot of bracing acidity. Flavors of dark fruit, grilled meat, herb and salt finish briny, with a final wave of hard tannins. Drink through 2016.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Malbec
"This blend of 45% Grenache Blanc, 25% Roussanne, 15% Clairette and 15% Viognier features notes of melon, banana and pineapple backed by a hint of wet stone. It's medium to full in body, with a silky texture, then thins out a bit on the tart finish. Drink up.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style White Blend
"Alongside the fresh red cherry fruit there are hints of iron oxide and pepper. None dominate, but they present themselves in beautiful waves making for a very intriguing palate with soft, pliable tannins and a fresh backbone. A very authentic rendition of Zweigelt. So fresh and so moreish.",Austria-Carnuntum-Zweigelt
"This is a cool-climate Chardonnay that's dark gold in color and tastes of ripe apple. From both the Ferrington and Savoy Vineyards, two of Anderson Valley's finest, it shows the greatness of the vintage in coastal Mendocino. Fragrant and rich in honey and toasty notes, it finishes crisp. Crab cakes with it would be ideal.",US-California-Chardonnay

"This red offers bright berry and violet in its pretty, perfumed nose, followed by soft, integrated cherry and pepper flavors. The wine has an impressive complexity and a spicy, lingering finish. Pair with cheeses, duck, turkey.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"A green, minty wave of challenging aromas comes with black olive, coconutty oak and graphite. The palate is bullish, scratchy in feel and tannic, with feral, herbal flavors of blackberry, juniper and wild herbs. Herbal and wild are the best words to describe this Syrah.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Syrah
"Somewhat aromatically restrained with notes of kiwi, pineapple and citrus. It's somewhat sleek in style but has with a lightly creamy feel. The wine is enjoyable but the acidity doesn't quite seem to be there to pull it all together.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"Dry, peppery and earthy on the nose, then juicy and fresh in the mouth, with herbal cherry, chocolate, olive and leathery flavors. Dark, smoky, toasty and varietally correct on the finish. A nice and true taste of Carmenère at a good price.",Chile-Central Valley-Carmenère
"Tightly herbaceous, this light and crisp wine is all citrus and gooseberries, with a tangy lemon zest texture. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Aromas of red berry, rose petal, blue flower, crushed herb and a whiff of espresso lift out of the glass along with a menthol note. The taut vibrant palate offers crushed strawberry, tart cherry, white pepper and star anise alongside tightly knit fine-grained tannins. It's extremely elegant but still youthfully austere at this stage so give it several more years to unwind. Drink 2023–2038.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Strawberries are the core of the fruit here, with plenty of acidity behind. The wine thins out quickly in the midpalate, and finishes high-toned and lightly fruity.",US-Washington-Barbera
"This young Chardonnay still shows plenty of yeasty scents and flavors, turning it almost beer-like. Light lemon and tea flavors, with a dash of baking spices, complete the picture.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"The exceptionally dry mineral flavors often found in designates from this AVA are here in abundance. In this instance, it seems to strip the fruit of any lushness, leaving tart cranberry backed with austere acidity. It's a good representation of the vineyard and the AVA, but needs to be carefully paired with an entrée. Try experimenting with something rich and creamy, like a peanut sauce.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"Merlot makes up just over three-quarters of this blend, with the balance Malbec, Cabernet Franc, Sangiovese and Petit Verdot.

A deep imprint of oak is felt on the palate, along with a tart rhubarb-like finish accented by a touch of black pepper.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Preponderant green, herbal aroma and flavor marks this wine. The mix of pencil lead and a smoky char never really make friends.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A disappointment. After a string of better vintages, Titus' 2004 Cab had a funky, reduced aroma, and tasted strangely flat and muted, with lots of smoky oak. Tasted twice, with consistent results.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Feline aromas—nothing unusual for Rueda Verdejo—are coupled with notes of briny apple and citrus. Fresh and easy on the palate, green-leaning citrus flavors finish tangy and slightly salty.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo

Easy drinking and delicious, it's made for sheer drinking pleasure. Drink through 2018.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

Dry, smooth and silky, it defines Pinot's more Burgundian side, with mushroomy notes along with perfectly ripe cherries and raspberries, accented with brilliant acidity.

This is a connoisseur's wine.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This family domaine has produced a rich, structured wine from its holding in Vosne-Romanée. It is firm, dark and concentrated with rich tannins and red-berry fruit. Spice, acidity and a dense aftertaste promise aging. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir

"There aren't that many organic Proseccos out there, and this expression from La Jara is thin, crisp and refreshing. There is a pungent grassy note at the outset that needs a few minutes to disappear.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"A spray of white pepper, lemon and green pear plays on the nose. The spicy palate majors in savory, yeasty notes of white pepper, miso, pea shoot and arugula, all brightened by lemon freshness. The slender and balanced palate is chock-full of flavor and leaves a lasting impression to savor.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"A huge, thick Syrah that couldn't possibly be fruitier. It explodes in blackberry and cherry jam, dark chocolate and toasty oak flavors, wrapped into sturdy tannins, leading to a finish of brown sugar and spices. Not for the faint-hearted, but a seriously great barbecue wine.",US-California-Shiraz

"The smoky aroma and toasty wood character smothers the fruit. It is a tough wine at this stage although it does hint at some of the 2012 juicy fruit flavors. Drink this firm, solid wine from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Young and tight, this new release shows excellent aging potential. The fruit is compact and complex, a lush mix of pomegranate, raspberry and cherry, spiced gracefully with sweet baking spices. There is a delicate herbal note as well, and the overall balance is superb.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A brooding bottle of tobacco and dark chocolate with ever-present tannins that go down easy and stay awhile. This single-vineyard designate from Livermore will impress Napa Valley Cab fans and encourage them to get to know this producer. Smith Ranch has body for miles, bolstered by flavors and aromas of blackberry, black plum and fig. This wine will develop further over the next 5–7 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Very structured, this solid wine has enough fruit to develop well. It comes from the estate that also produces Barca Velha in the very top vintages. The wine is full, rich and concentrated. The tannins and structure will take time to soften, so wait until 2020.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This could be Chardonnay, or any light white wine. Fruit flavors are apple and pear; there's lots of acidity. A simple, pleasant, everyday style.",US-Washington-Pinot Gris
Medicinal and saline aromas lead the nose. The medicinal—almost chemical—sensation carries over to the lean palate while raspy tannins leave a grainy finish.,Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Concentrate rose petals, crisp raspberries, and a rocky, black gravel—not quite as pungent as asphalt—pervades the nose on this wine from an extremely coastal, 13-acre vineyard planted in 1988. Flavors of freshly picked blackberry mesh with lots of fennel, licorice and anise-seed spice.",US-California-Syrah

"Nutty flavors of new oak signal a more international style of Pinot, but the underlying fruit speaks eloquently of ripe, red cherry and offers glimpses of raspberry. Subtle spice plays around the edges. The palate is rounded and soft but has a refreshing vein of acidity.",Austria-Burgenland-Pinot Noir
"A fine example of how integrated the Xinomavro grape can be. Earthy, Mediterranean nosings of eucalyptus, olive and clove lead into balanced, simply attractive flavors of spice and fruit that are robust but refined. A great choice for a spiced meat entree—think grilled lamb kebabs. Tannic but smooth.",Greece-Naoussa-Xinomavro
"Mountain-grown fruit gives this wine an exceptional intensity and purity of flavor. Tastes like the essence of blackberries, sprinkled with black pepper, anise and cocoa. As rich as it is, the finish is perfectly dry. There's a rusticity to the texture, but that's why Zinfandel is Zinfandel. Drink over the next six years, especially with barbecue or fine roasted meats and root vegetables.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Blended with 20% Petit Verdot, this unusual offering brings notes of mushroom, herbs, smoke and dark cherries. It's tightly wound with a firm squeeze of tannins.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"An intensely dark color makes this wine easy to pick out, even from across a room. The chocolate, raisin and blackberry-jam flavors are rich and the texture is mouthcoating, almost thick, but not harshly tannic. The wine seems to start out dry and finish ripe and rich.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Rather heavy and super-fruity now, with fruitstand flavors of blackberries, cherries and plums. It's a ripely delicious wine, but a bit one-dimensional, not showing much elegance or subtlety. Could develop bottle nuance over the next 4–6 years.",US-California-Syrah
"Firm and solid, this wine is more tannin than fruit at this stage. It does have some weight and acidity to it, showing potential for blackberry fruitiness with age.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Raw and green from the opening shot, this smells like bell pepper and wood. The jumbled palate is abrasive, while severely green flavors of olives, herbs, weeds and dried red fruits finish scratchy.",Chile-Maule Valley-Carmenère
"This firmly structured wine opens with toasted aromas, baked plum, fennel and a licorice note. The palate offers dried cherry, fig, roasted coffee bean and anisette alongside bracing tannins. Drink through 2020.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This is a rich, fruity wine that has a definite minerally character. The chalky texture is laced with lemon and apricot flavors, leading to a crisp, tight finish.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Fresh on the nose with black plum, dried tarragon, hot asphalt, potpourri and a touch of Earl Grey tea, this is a well-priced wine with great versatility for all sorts of foods. The palate is vibrant and bursting with energy, juicy enough for a summer day but made serious with firm tannins. It could hold up to steak as well as complementing roasted fish.",US-California-Dolcetto
"Light, fruity and fragrant, this is an attractive, crisp wine that highlights red-berry fruits and soft acidity. It's a wine to drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Made from 80% Pinot Noir and 20% Chardonnay, this dances in cherry and orange brightness within a construct of white peach. The pretty-in-pink color gives way to buzzing acidity and freshness before a medium-strength creaminess flows through on the finish.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"This ultrarich, opulent wine has such purity of fruit. With its pepper and spice flavors layered over mango and ripe nectarine, it is a straight line of pure flavor, rich and complex.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"Speri's delicious Ripasso offers thick concentration and pulpy notes of chocolate and black cherry. The wine is soft, velvety and would pair well with oven-baked pasta topped with hearty meat ragú.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"

"Vibrant diesel, orange rind, white flower and dried apricot aromas lead to dry stone fruit flavors in this wine. It shows a pleasant balance and persists through the finish.",US-Washington-Riesling
"The vineyards of Vendômois lie in the Loir valley and north of the Loire proper. That gives them an extra tang of coolness as well as intensity. This crisp, baked-apple and spice-flavored wine is delicious, fruity while also well structured. Drink this perfumed wine now.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"From a good vintage like 2009, this modest Tinta de Toro has a lot to offer. It smells slightly rustic but full of fruit. The palate has a tannic but balanced feel, with dark, sweet flavors of cassis and blackberry. It's peppery and lightly herbal on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro
"The unusual aromas on this wine are a confounding mix of fusel oil and grass, much like a Sauvignon Blanc. The wine has noticeable residual sugar as well. This seems way out of any varietal norm for Oregon Pinot Gris, but other than that, it's perfectly quaffable.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Fragrant and enjoyable, this offers aromas of ripe berry, Mediterranean herb, pressed violet and a whiff of pine forest. On the round easygoing palate, savory notes of brown cooking spice accent a core of red cherry and black raspberry. Enjoy through 2017.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This is a spicy, vibrantly realized wine from a coastal ridge five miles from the Pacific Ocean dusted in sandy, loam soils. It's planted entirely to the Swan clone, which can contribute an undeniable wildness to the variety. Baked cherry meets spearmint and clove, the acidity light and bright with plenty of texture atop the medium-sized body.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Cabernet Sauvignon from Champoux and Weinbau vineyards make up the heart of this wine, with a balance of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Cocoa, vanilla, dark plum, spice and herb aromas are followed by generous dark fruit flavors that coat the palate from end to end, with a lingering coffee note. At once hedonistic and balanced, it has a long life ahead of it. Best after 2022.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Richly fruity, this is a wine in progress. Its acidity and texture are still coming together to give a crisp wine with ripe fruit. Lemon and lime flavors will add a refreshing background. Drink from late 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This all-Sangiovese Chianti opens with black-skinned fruit, allspice and new leather aromas. Polished tannins lend structure to the dried black cherry, licorice and a tobacco flavors on the palate. Drink through 2022.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Very ripe in blackberries and cherries, with a nice coating of toasty oak, with a long, spicy finish. The texture is a bit aggressive, with sandpapery tannins. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink now–2015.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is already attractively balanced with ripe red plum fruits giving weight. That is backed by the firm wood and fruit tannins that offer spice and a creamy texture. Drink from 2017. An Alain Aubert estate, it is run by daughter and oenologist Amélie Aubert.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Lots of sweet, ripe cherries in this Syrah, which also shows classic, cool-climate aromas of black pepper. A disagreeable note of crushed cigarette butts is a big minus.",US-California-Syrah
"Good black cherry, currant and anise flavors in this dry, full-bodied young Merlot. It's tannic and brisk in acidity, and has a nice edge of smoky oak. Doesn't seem like it has a future, though, so drink up.",US-California-Merlot
"This has the acidity to complement the 7.2% residual sugar, but it flattens out in the mouth. As a result, it loses the freshness, and feels a little dull, leaving a sugary aftertaste.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Tastes pretty dry and tannic, with lots of astringency, and finishes hard and gritty. Not a wine you want to drink now. But there's a huge core of blackberries hidden below, accompanied by a burst of juicy acidity. Seems to have the balance for cellaring. The score reflects what this Cab will likely be in 6–8 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Petal pink in the glass, this wine was specifically grown to be a rosé by winemaker David Galzignato. The nose is pretty with bubble gum, strawberry, raspberry and a bit of lime peel, and the palate offers flavors of ruby-red grapefruit and lemon juice, with bright acidity throughout.",US-California-Mourvèdre
"The blend is 51% Merlot, the rest divided among five other grapes, including Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Consequently, it's a bit of a mish-mash, fruity to the point of grapy, medium long, with the barrel flavors unresolved. Give this one another year or two of aging to allow all the components to come together.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Half Merlot and half Cabernet Sauvignon. The Merlot saves the day, rescuing the underripe Cab with rich flavors of cherries and red plums. Oak adds the usual notes of sweet buttered toast and spice. Drink now.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Talley's basic estate Pinot can be good, and it can be ordinary. The '06 is pretty tannic and direct. It's a hard, tough wine that's not particularly lush, although it's clean and properly varietal. You'll find cherry and currant flavors that veer into raisins.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A gorgeous Cabernet, rich and flamboyant, the kind of wine that knocks you out at first sip. It's soft but complex in tannins, and dry, with luxurious blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors brightened by fine acidity. Hard to say where it's going, but so delicious, it's a wine to drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Attractive, wood and yellow fruit laden wine. It's soft, rounded with bright acidity and a spicy character. It's wood probably needs to soften over the next few months.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This Malbec-driven blend is concentrated up front, with staunch aromas of espresso, balsamic vinegar, leather, raw oak and mixed black fruits. This is big and lush, but vaguely focused on the midpalate. Flavors of berry fruits, toast and balsamic brine end with cushion and moderate structure. Drink through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Pointed red-plum aromas are lemony and leathery. The palate is decidedly tomatoey and acidic, with flavors of plum skin, currant and pepper. An herbal, spicy, drying finish feels raw and tastes sour.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Rounder and less textured than a Sancerre, this style of Menetou-Salon makes a fine alternative Sauvignon Blanc. It's full and ripe, fresh with acidity while also bringing some tropical fruits into play. It's ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Rich in character, this is a dense wine, with smoky tannins and juicy red fruits that are deliciously ripe. The tannins and the fruit concentration result in a weighty yet brightly acidic wine. It will develop quickly, and then remain at a peak for many years. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Easy red fruit, fresh black and red cherry with lots of flow, drive and softness wash over the palate. There is freshness at the core and a certain untroubled ease. This is made for ready drinking and has a pliable, smooth nature.",Austria-Burgenland-Zweigelt
"This small appellation is an enclave in the middle of Côtes de Provence. Its style is very similar and this wine, named after the owner, is a structured blend of Syrah and Grenache. The wine from organic grapes has a pepper and spice edge over the crisp acidity of the red fruits. Drink now.",France-Provence-Rosé
A distinct pink color and overtly fruity flavors combine with strong bubbles. The wine has vivid red-cherry and raspberry flavors and a bit of the texture of a red wine.,US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Prickly citrus aromas are jumpy and a touch sulfuric. This feels leesy, creamy and fat in the mouth, with creamy, tropical flavors of melon and papaya. Bitter flavors of almond and citrus pith vie with lees-based vanilla notes on a round, plump finish.",Spain-Catalonia-White Blend
"Rubbery and smoky at first, with leather and berry fruit running secondary to the wine's more reduced qualities. But if given ten minutes to unwind, it shows wide black-fruit flavors, creaminess and finally some barrel-based resin. Gets better the more you work with it, but will always register as “oaky.”",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"The Goldert Grand Cru with its stone and chalk soil gives powerful wines. That's the case here with this dense, tense bottling. The spice is intense, rich and concentrated. A touch of acidity keeps everything in check. Drink from 2017.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"A little sluggish on the nose, but if you concentrate on the feel and overall balance the wine grades out fairly well. The flavors run from pickled raspberry to salty plum, and never is the wine very sweet or rich. Conversely, it settles on tight and lean, with juiciness rather than pulp.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Caramelized chocolate and dust line the drive of this robustly ripe and concentrated red, that's ultimately unfussy in its approach. Soft in texture, it finishes in a strong grip of tannin.",US-California-Cabernet Franc

"The aromas bring notes of toasty spices, black currant, green pepper and blue fruit. The fruit and smoke flavors are smooth and easy drinking, with lightly grainy tannins providing support. It needs some more time to fully come together.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This unusual, but successful, combination of Tempranillo, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon is a great example of modern Paso blending. Each grape variety fills in the deficiencies of the others, resulting in a harmonious whole. It has the tannic weight of Cabernet, with complex cherry, mocha, cola and spice flavors that drink well now. There's some burn in the finish that detracts.",US-California-Red Blend
"The wine does have fruit, but it is masked by strong burnt tannins from the wood aging. The acidity shows the possibility of red berry fruits appearing later.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A structured, firm wine showing a great balance of red fruits, dry Bordeaux-style tannins and a freshly jammy texture. For a branded Bordeaux, it has both quality and elegance.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This medium-bodied Grenache features vanilla and raspberry compote on the nose. It's a smooth, if not particularly textural wine, with berry flavors and hints of toast that fall away on the finish. Drink now.",Australia-South Australia-Grenache
"Tropical aromas arise from the bouquet of this unoaked new Chardonnay, and there's some pineapple and lemon-lime thrown in. Flavors of apple sauce, cinnamon and lime juice are sweet and tasty, while the mouthfeel is simple and fleshy. Drink now for the wine's youthful jump.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"Firm and stalky, this wine has intense black currant fruitiness. A dry tannic core is balanced by the fresh fruits and acidity. It's almost too fruity at the moment and needs to soften, so wait until 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This magenta-colored blend is mostly Bobal, and it smells reduced, with raw raspberry and plum scents. A racy, rubbery and pinching palate holds tart plum and currant flavors. This wine is constrained as a whole, but juicy.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"A big, rich, fruity, oaky Pinot Noir, offering waves of raspberry and cherry pie, currant, cola, baking spice and sandalwood flavors. Tastes delicious ripe, but finishes dry in a bracing swirl of acids and tannins. Drink now–2016.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A little too fiery and monotone for me. Noticeable alcohol, on the nose and at the end, weighs down the edges, and frankly the dark-style fruit is forced to wear a heavy blanket of sizzle and barrel char. Has its merits, but you better be able to handle the menthol, cola, char and heat to get into the game.",Spain-Central Spain-Red Blend
"There is a creamy, leesy mouthfeel to this estate-grown Riesling, whose residual sugar is masked with acidity. Tart apple and pear fruit flavors finish with lighter notes of candied orange and citrus.",US-Washington-Riesling
"This may lack the silky completeness of Gros's 2007 Côté Terroir, but this open-knit blend of 50% Grenache, 25% Carignan and 25% Syrah still delivers a bold mouthful of plum and roasted meat flavors. Drink now.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"From vines grown on sandy soil close to the ocean, the wine is juicy, soft and fresh. It has attractive acidity, red-berry fruits and a generous open texture that makes the wine ready to drink now.",Portugal-Península de Setúbal-Portuguese Red
"Big blackberry and pungent black-currant aromas meet with gooey fudge, black licorice and lilac on the large and lovely nose of this bottling, which is made with 5% Viognier. It's thick and juicy on the sip, with tons of anise, dill, baked blackberry, cassis and a well-integrated minty character.",US-California-Syrah
"Dark-skinned berry and culinary spice aromas float from the glass. The straightforward savory palate evokes black cherry, cassis and ground clove accompanied by polished tannins.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"In the hands of master blender Dirk Niepoort, even a straight tawny style has depth of flavor and intensity. The wine has red fruit, layered with concentrated acidity, a hint of wood aging, and remains fresh and fruity.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Bright, moderately complex aromas of stone fruits and minerals precede a firm, lemony palate with familiar, highly fresh tangerine and nectarine flavors. This holds its form and snap on the finish. Drink during 2016.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"This rich wine is still young, but packed with dark tannins and concentrated black-currant fruitiness. This hand-picked blend of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon needs to age. It will not be ready to drink before 2019. The chateau is the home of the Dubourdieu family.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The Frog, it's called, and, no doubt it could be drunk with frogs' legs. But, with its intense crispness and superfresh, almost Sauvignon Blanc, green flavor, it would be much better with seafood.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"A note of apple is the most identifiable aroma on the fresh nose. The palate is clean and lean, with lemon, orange, nectarine and mildly bitter, pithy flavors. Racy and not at all oaky on the finish.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Chardonnay
"The shy nose gives away a flinty hint of reduction. The palate has a juicier, easier quality where green pear, slightly earthy yeast and fresh citrus are drawn together. The body is light, fresh and very invigorating. With a little air, more aromas awake and present notions of Conference pear and yeasty saltiness.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"Made from a blend of Sangiovese, Colorino, Canaiolo and Ciliegiolo, this vibrant Rosso has sensations of black plum, ripe sour cherry, baking spices and Mediterranean herbs. The palate delivers brisk acidity and lithe tannins. Enjoy it soon with substantial first courses like pasta topped with meat sauce or four-cheese gnocchi.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Grapefruit and other citrus aromas are zesty but standard. That's also how the palate comes across: citric and juicy, but average. Flavors of orange and tangerine finish fresh but continue the one-note theme.",Spain-Northern Spain-White Blend
"This eclectic blend of Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tannat along with Syrah, Malbec and Merlot is, in fact, a fresh, soft, caramel flavored wine. It has red fruits, light acidity and a smooth texture. It is ready to drink.",France-Southwest France-Rosé
"This is a good, rather standard Pinot Noir. It's varietally correct in the dry, silky mouthfeel and flavors of cherries, cola and herbs, tinged with oak. Nothing to get excited about. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"There is no indication on the bottle what this blend might be. Regardless of composition, it's a generic, solid wine with melon and vanilla cookie aromas backed by a round, citrusy mouthfeel. Flavors of briny citrus and white grapefruit finish decently.",Spain-Central Spain-White Blend
"This opens with a strong scent of herb and bud; it's sharp and aggressively leafy. The wine follows with similar flavors. The light fruit flavors of plum and berry are quickly suffocated with leaf, herb, earth, spice and tannin. Time may be the answer.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"There's not much to this light-bodied Merlot, its soft dark cherry, vanilla and plum flavors muted and hard to make out. From a San Francisco-based vintner making wines from around the world, including Bordeaux and South Australia, it sources Merlot from both Rutherford and Oakville.",US-California-Merlot
"Cabernet Sauvignon (37%) and Cabernet Franc (34%) make up the majority of this wine, with the balance Merlot (16%), Malbec (8%) and Petit Verdot. The aromas are quite locked up, with light notes of barrel spice, herb and assorted dark fruit. The palate has light tightly coiled fruit flavors. It needs time to reveal its charms. Best after 2021.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Shows the ripe, flashy side of Viognier, with orange, tropical fruit, pear and vanilla flavors. Brisk acidity provides fortunate balance. Drink now with Asian fare, a salad with savory greens and fruit.",US-California-Viognier
"Aromas of mint, berry syrup and dense, lemony oak lay a good foundation for the heavy black fruit that comes on the palate atop a plush carpet of toasty, fresh-grained wood. The finish is round, tasty and mouthfilling, while overall the wine seems to dance due to popping acidity. This is Carmenère with a vital streak.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Carmenère
"The wine is soft, and full of fruit with attractive spicy black currant flavors. Dominated by the rounded Tinta Roriz, it is an easy wine to drink young.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"One of the many labels owned by the Grassa family of Domaine du Tariquet, this is so light and fresh that it just floats across the palate. It is citrus-crisp, with a tight apple skin texture. Great for apéritifs. Screwcap.",France-Southwest France-White Blend
"This late release, aging for five years, has produced a majestic wine. Its breadth of flavor, with ripe fruits as well as intense structure, are gently transitioning from the first flush of youth to a more mature character. Intensely textured, tight, ready to spring, it shows the beauty of maturing Riesling. Drink now, although it will age many more years.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"This wine has good richness, with a sense of heft in the texture. Warm and dark fruit flavors suggest black plum and blackberry, with very full body and a touch of sweetness that lingers on the finish. This wine can be enjoyed like a Port after dinner.",US-California-Primitivo
"Grassy and sweet smelling, with apple and lightly candied aromas. Nice and normal in the mouth, with sweet, ripe flavors of white fruits, powdered sugar and pear. Turns a bit cloying on the finish. Seems sweeter and less complex than in the past.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Generic red-fruit aromas set up a solid palate. This tastes of roasted plum and berry fruits, while a straightforward finish is grabby in feel and tastes the slightest bit herbal and green.",Chile-Central Valley-Merlot
"Warm and robust, this full-bodied Barolo offers aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, tar and kirsch. The palate is bold and hearty but also shows the heat of the vintage, doling out cherry-marinated-in-spirits, licorice and clove alongside almost scorching alcohol. Drink sooner rather than later.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Consistent with past versions of this reserve-level Cabernet, this new vintage is smooth and sweetly fruity, with plenty of new oak aging under its belt. The tannins are ripe and svelte, and a streak of iron and licorice runs right down the spine. Drink now through 2020.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The assertive elegance of a French Bordeaux is present here, but the Fusion also has a South African edge to it that gives it extra appeal. The nose, a subtle layering of luscious berry, minerality and spice, rolls into a clean, taut but flirty combination of plum and pepper, edged very quietly by tobacco smoke. Serious but with a feminine touch, this wine is made for food pairing.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a restrained and structured wine, light in tart cranberry, rhubarb and an overwhelming attraction of baked plum. Lush and plush on the palate without ever pushing too far, it lingers in cardamom.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"BlackJack is sourced from the oldest block in the vineyard, planted in 1965 by original owner Charles Coury. This clone, rumored to have arrived from France in a suitcase, is named for him. This new release, still young and integrating the French oak (14 months, 30% new), offers black-cherry fruit with barrel toast and coffee flavors. Drink now through 2028.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"There is a great burst of appealing acidity in this wine, accompanied by refreshing red fruits. This balanced wine is lively, crisp and with plenty of flavor. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"Given four years in 100% new French oak and another year in bottle, this is a blockbuster of a wine. It's huge in every way, from its intensity of coconut, vanilla and milk chocolate to its dense, chalky tannins. It may need time to come around, its sheer weight impressively wrapped in blackberry and blueberry jam.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"This accessible Barbaresco opens with ripe red berry, rose, leather and earthy aromas. The fresh palate offers dark cherry, ripe raspberry and black pepper alongside firm tannins and bright acidity. Drink now–2019.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Missoni is an oak-aged Cabernet Sauvignon that opens with soft, chewy fruit and aromas of cherry liqueur, rum cake, espresso and exotic spice. The mouthfeel is plush, round and driven by plump blackberry flavors.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dark, meaty and mellow on the nose, with blackberry and a distant hint of tomato leaf. It's a fraction candied and scratchy in the mouth, but the mildly herbal plum and cherry flavors are solid. Sweet and slightly smoky on the finish, with fading substance the longer it goes.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dry and bitter, this Sangiovese is better than most California bottlings, but has its work cut out for it. It shows a good range of tart cherryskin flavors, with additional flavors of acidic things like espresso and tobacco.",US-California-Sangiovese
"There is a lot of fruit in the aroma and flavor of this wine. That, along with a touch of floral influence, make this medium-bodied wine fresh and alluring. Notes like Anjou pear, jasmine, ripe peach and a hint of vanilla swirl softly around the palate.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Smoky, stalky plum, cherry and tea aromas set up a dry, full-sized palate with herbal raspberry flavors touched up by briny salt and woody pepper notes. A racy, salty finish reflects cool-climate origins.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir
"Rosy cherry and plum aromas turn more rubbery and raisiny as this airs out. Solid, lifted and deep on the palate, this varietal Garnacha deals lightly herbal, floral flavors of plum and cherry cough drop, while the finish is oaky, resiny, raw, scouring and tough. Nothing about this is subtle or elegant, but it is dynamic. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Catalonia-Garnacha
"Vibrant and crisp, this offers delicate aromas of acacia flower and citrus. The bright, linear palate shows crunchy green apple, tangerine zest and a hint of white almond alongside racy acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio

"Produced from two parcels on the Montagne de Reims, this dry yet soft wine is ripe and richly fruity. Still young, its minerality and bright fruitiness are firmly intact. It will be a delicious Champagne as it matures. Drink from 2019.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"This dry and restrained wine offers spice in profusion. Balanced with acidity and a firm texture, it's very much for food.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer

"All black fruits, the wine is dominated by black currants and stalky tannins. It is fresh with lively acidity and berry flavors and a generous texture. Drink from 2016.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"While there's a decent amount of weight to this wine—enough to stand up to food—the flavors seem a bit dilute, showing only hints of almond and melon.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"With the alcohol clocking in at 16%, the wine has a taste chili pepper, with raisin and plum notes.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A delightful citrus scent intrigues, suggesting yuzu or mandarin. The palate is richer and introduces notions of earth and that pithy, phenolic edge of serious Grüner Veltliner. The initial citrus on the nose returns with redoubled force on the streamlined, fresh and still tightly closed palate. Give this time to unwind, so that the fruit can fully express itself. The deliciously green- and orange-tinged finish promises everything. Drink from 2017.",Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
"Initially this smells like bell pepper and green bean more than ripe berry fruits, but with time in the glass it rounds into spicy, herbal form. A tight, reedy palate is bolstered by tomatoey acidity, while flavors of herbal raspberry and red currant finish with ripped tannins and plenty of residual acidity. Drink through 2024.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"An impressively rich Sancerre red, showing plenty of red berry fruits, tight tannins and balanced acidity. Yes, it is not Burgundy, but in 2005 Sancerre could really justify its red wines, and this example, with delicacy and elegance, works well.",France-Loire Valley-Pinot Noir
"A delicious, crisp and fruity wine that's textured with minerality and a tang of lemon zest. On the palate a raspberry flavor dominates, with layers of acidity and a lively, bright aftertaste.",France-Provence-Rosé

"Here's a vibrant, ruby-colored blend of Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese, in equal parts, that delivers raw spice and typical aromas of Cab along with generous tones of red cherry, cocoa butter, toasted and mineral notes.

"This is one of a collection of Champagnes tasted and approved by a group of growers under the Special Club label. With a predominance of Chardonnay, it's still crisp and fruity, showing rich apple and pear flavors. Its citrusy acidity gives it lift, slowing any signs of maturity. It will continue to age gracefully but is delicious now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Already beautiful and rich, this has power, concentration and many layers of ripe berry fruits. Red plums also come through strongly, bringing in juicy acidity. This dense and muscular wine should age. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Bright cherry cola and black currant gives this Brunello a plump and fruity personality that is difficult to find in the wines of 2008.

"This is an inky, black Amarone that is redolent of black fruit, plum, BBQ sauce, root beer and mesquite smoke. Pair this wine with thick beef ragout over oven-roasted pasta or game dishes. The wine is sticky and ripe in the mouth with firm tannins.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Plump and inviting black cherry fruit melds with char, soy and purple flower aromas on the nose of this atypical blend of 38% Syrah, 31% Cabernet Franc and 31% Merlot.

"Powerfully built with nice depth, this is loaded with succulent black cherry sensations layered with underbrush, tobacco, licorice, black pepper, clove and mocha accents. The palate is balanced by firm, velvety tannins and fresh acidity. Hold for complexity. Drink 2016–2026.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This is certainly a rich wine, the yellow peach flavors ripe and concentrated. But there is also a hard core where the botrytis dominates and makes for a tight character. It is missing charm.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend

"This opens with aromas suggesting new oak, new leather, coconut, dried herb and a whiff of underbrush.

Give the tannins a few more years to soften then drink before the remaining fruit dries up.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This block selection hews closer to more conventional Oregon Pinots than the rest of the winery's portfolio, with powerful focused black-cherry fruit at its heart.

Those flavors come through in deft touches of graham cracker and cocoa powder, underscored with a wet-cement minerality.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"Yeasty freshness swings along with the citrus, watercress, green pear and miso flavors, showing that this is made to last.

Drink as of 2017.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"Despite intriguing notes of ripe red cherries, menthol and barnyard that peek through, tar and smoke from heavily charred French oak dominate both the nose and palate. There's a pleasant midpalate of black fruit and pepper spice but its brief appearance is overshadowed again by a deep char finish.",US-New York-Merlot

The Alicante Bouschet in the blend gives the wine its dark color and also its intense fruits. Drink now.",Portugal-Alentejo-Portuguese Red

"Slightly musky and briny on the nose, with a broad underlay of peach. This medium-bodied Riesling seems lightly honeyed and a little soft relative to its peer group. A user-friendly introduction to Australian Riesling that should be consumed over the next 6–9 months.",Australia-South Australia-Riesling
"Lalande de Pomerol is the northern extension of Pomerol, so it's no surprise to find this wine dominated by Merlot. It is soft, rounded and rich. Black plums give the fruitiness while black fruit skins provide the texture. It's a full wine that needs a little aging. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Soupy heavy aromas suggest that the sun-baked conditions of 2011 got the better of this wine. In the mouth, this feels jammy and thick, with a shortage of balance and elegance.

It doesn't taste like textbook Prosecco, but cut it some slack because it is one of a handful or organic Prosecco sparklers in existence.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"This wine opens with toasted nut, dried herb and citrus zest aromas. On the linear, lean palate, thyme and mineral notes back up yellow apple flavors, with lively acidity. It closes on a bitter almond note.",Italy-Lombardy-Turbiana

"Under the regime of Gérard Perse, Pavie seems to have become more opulent, more extracted, and, dare I say it, more simplistic. The richness of the 2000 vintage lends itself to this technique. While it is a wonderful, immediately appealing wine, with its intense dark fruits, it seem to lack the complexity of other wines of similar status.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"All the parts are here to make this Pinot a lovely companion to appropriate beef, pork and game dishes, especially if wild mushrooms are involved. The wine is utterly dry and bright in acidity, and the tannins are fairly thick for a Pinot Noir.

"Dark in color, with aromas of road tar, blackberry and burnt toast. The palate has good life and snap to it, with flavors of black cherry, plum, chocolaty oak and a dash of cough medicine. Solid and scouring on the finish, with vanilla to soften things up. Regular but good value.",Chile-Rapel Valley-Merlot
"One of a trio of Pinot Gris offered in this vintage, this has a yeasty beery character. It falls into a generic white wine style, refreshing enough for a warm day's glug, with that yeasty tang reminiscent of a good cold brew. There is not much in the way of varietal expression though, just a bit of apple and pear fruit coming up in the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris

"Baking spice, vanilla and dark-fruit aromas are followed by dark cherry and coffee flavors that linger on the finish. The barrel influence seems a little intense.",US-Washington-Syrah

"A blend of 81% Merlot, 12% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot. An unusually tight Pedestal, this absolutely must be decanted.

Unlike most white Châteauneufs, it would probably benefit from a few years of cellaring.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style White Blend

At its juicy core is an earthy, mushroomy component.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Firmly in the style of the vintage, this is dense, full-bodied Cornas, with plenty of fruit. Intense plum, coffee and black olive notes dominate, while the tannins are ripe and plush. Believe it or not, this is actually drinkable now, yet should age easily through at least 2025.",France-Rhône Valley-Syrah
"Aromas of butterscotch, toasted oak, roasted coffee and espresso follow through to the palate along with notes of black pepper. There's not enough fruit richness to stand up to the astringent, woody tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This exuberant wine is rich in tannins and fruit. It has power and a direct in-your-face fruitiness. The structure is soft only because there is so much fruit. In fact, it has a firm core.

"Dark and concentrated in appearance, this hearty Aglianico opens with tones of spice and smoked bacon backed by black fruit, tobacco and dark leather.

"Pale pink in color, the aromas offer notes of strawberry, bubblegum and apple. Lightly spritzy, it brings forward somewhat-weighty-feeling fruit flavors. Despite the spritz, it seems a bit ponderous.",US-Washington-Rosé

"The single-vineyard experts at Testarossa hit a homerun with this wine from a famed property.

"De Bortoli's 2006 Estate Grown Pinot Noir lacks the bright fruit and user-friendliness of its Gulf Station or Windy Peak bottlings. Maybe it's too serious for its own good? This medium-bodied wine features leather, mushroom and molasses, and rather crisp acids as well.",Australia-Victoria-Pinot Noir

"While slender in frame, this vibrantly zesty, herbal wine offers loads of intensity and vibe.

"From the Stoney Vine (estate) vineyard, this has a fair share of the aromatic funk for which the Rocks section of Walla Walla is famous. It's a nose-teasing, mouthwatering mix of composted grass cuttings, soy sauce, bacon and berry, showing a touch of new oak as well.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This ambitious, impressively structured wine will appeal to those who run from wines made in the fruit-bomb style.

"Tastes rustic and harsh, with acidity giving it a sting. The fruit is drying out and turning raisiny.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A ripe bold wine with generous black fruits, it is a blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc. Dark and concentrated, it brings together rich fruitiness and firm tannins that will allow it to age. Drink from 2018. The wine comes from a vineyard that is currently in biodynamic conversion.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Very dry, very tannic and austere, this southern Rhône-style blend isn't offering much now beyond the astringency. Airing coaxes out some modest cherry, Dr. Pepper cola and leather flavors, but it will always remain a tough, harsh wine.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"At first sharp and showing the influence of barrel aging in roughly 20% new French oak, this opens up and smoothes out into a supple, buttery wine. It's rich with flavors of pineapple, baked apple, sweet spices and a hint of mint. Polished and sophisticated, it generously rewards your attention with plenty of delicious details.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay

"A well-made blend of Spanish and Portuguese red varietals, with the majority Tempranillo, with bright red cherry and cranberry and high acidic tones that's also got a touch of lovely minerality, olive, toffee and vanilla.

"From the pale straw color to the delicate citrus and honeyed aromas, this wine strives for elegance and finesse and largely achieves it. Light but suggesting strawberries and limes. Dry, with a rich, creamy texture. Really stands out for elegance and harmony, and finishes on a slightly bitter-almond note.",US-California-Champagne Blend

"The flint and chalk nature of the soil shows in this wine. From old vines well situated in the Premier Cru of Montmains, it has concentration and a tight, young texture that will need to develop. It is fresh and full of citrus now, although a riper, creamy character will be coming through as it matures. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"This vintage of San Román is extremely ripe and oaky, with buttery richness sharing the nose with asphalt, wood resin, cassis and dark-berry aromas.

Drink through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro

"This seems to be a bottling of some of the best blocks from the winery's Firepeak estate vineyard. Although it's modest in alcohol and quite acidic, it's richer and deeper than Baileyana's El Pico Pinot, with waves of cherries, cola, rhubarb and spice. Should develop bottle complexity over the next 3–5 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Shows a real Burgundian-style earthiness, with rich humous, mushroom and gamy, leathery flavors, marbled with a deep well of spicy plum sauce. This earthy richness, with the distinct tannins, suggests ageability for this dry wine. Best after 2009.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is not your standard Moscato d'Asti.

"Big, balanced and very flavorful, this full-bodied, handsomely oaked wine is easy to love. Baking-spice aromas, ripe black-cherry flavors and firm, fine-grained tannins make a harmonious mix.",US-California-Red Blend
"This is a finely structured wine that will age well. With black-plum fruits, layers of dark young tannins and balanced acidity, it is both juicy and full of great ripe swathes of fruit. From the cru estate that is owned by Louis Jadot in Beaune, it is impressive and worth aging. Drink from 2018.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"The label says California but these grapes are from Clarksburg, near Lodi and for Pinot Noir, leave a little to be desired. Mostly fruit, the wine's aromas and flavors are fairly simple and oaky. There's not much saying Pinot Noir specifically here.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Maybe a tad off the pace from the excellent 2008, but still a wonderfully rich, complex wine. Pale in color, it tastes fresh and lively, with raspberry and cherry sour candy flavors accompanied by a burst of zesty acidity. Enjoyable now, and should gain bottle complexities over the next six years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This everyday Chardonnay will appeal to fans of the modern style of ripe fruit and plenty of oak. It's rich and creamy, with pineapple, tangerine and mango flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Delicious in pastry-filling raspberry and cherry flavors, with a baked brown sugar richness and exotic touches of vanilla, cinnamon, anise and toast.

"There's something so smoothly sweet about this Cabernet, it's like an old Cognac.

Really quite a compelling wine that's beautiful now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Some leathery, clove-like notes spice up this solidly built Pinot. Hints of briar add more complexity to the cherry fruit, before some drying tannins take over on the finish. Rather than aging this to mellow the tannins, try it alongside beef or lamb instead.",New Zealand-Central Otago-Pinot Noir

"Too soft in acidity, so the blackberry, currant, cherry liqueur and spice flavors have a curious jamminess. The softness and high alcohol emphasize sweetness, affecting the finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Very restrained aromas of Meyer-lemon pith, apple blossoms and scratched Key lime show on the nose of this appellation blend. There is a slightly burnt butter character to the sip, where touches of sweet corn and vanilla meet with citrus tang. Altogether, it's a very light expression of the region.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Notturno is an easy-drinking Sangiovese that delivers ripe fruit, prune and a dark garnet color. There's a darker, flatter and bolder quality to the grape farmed in the Forlì area of Emilia-Romagna compared to the same grape in Tuscany.",Italy-Central Italy-Sangiovese
"From a dark bottle, this salmon-colored rosé is medium-bodied and made in a bigger style than many others. Fully textured, it discloses flavorful touches of crunchy pear and cranberry. It would go well with a goat cheese salad adorned in dried cranberries and cherries.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"As sharp, fresh and fruity as a jar of raspberry, cherry and blackberry jam, melted into liquid and fortified with alcohol. Feels hot, too, despite an official alcohol reading of just 14%.

"A bouquet of black cherry, tart cranberry and clove opens into flavors of cherry, anisette, espresso bean and mint, with a hint of tart cranberry. The minty notes can almost seem overly strong for a moment, but tart tones bring the fruit flavors back to the foreground. The pleasantly gripping tannins will mellow with a few more years of aging.",Israel-Galilee-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This is not from a generally declared Port Vintage year. However, the year did produce some exceptional wines, such as this one. It has a firm tannic structure under opulent black fruits.

A length of cardamom provides a memorable spiciness to the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir

A strong menthol lift arises on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Higher in alcohol than Hobo's other '07 Zins, the Treborce is also a bit hotter in the mouth. It has a tug of chili pepper heat with the intensely ripe blackberry, cherry, milk chocolate and spice flavors. Needs barbecue and similar rich fare to do its thing.",US-California-Zinfandel

"This is the third release of Figgins, a single wine produced by Leonetti's Chris Figgins from his Figgins Estate vineyard. Intensely aromatic, it explodes from the glass with baking spices and deep cassis fruit.

"This is from a block of younger vines made from Dijon clones within the larger Arrendell Vineyard. The wine is quite full-bodied and robust, almost rustic, which is mainly due to the powerful, young tannins. With explosive berry, currant and mocha flavors, this powerful wine should hit its stride in mid-2010.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This just off-dry wine is fresh, young and fruity. It leads with a lemony scent and crisp acidity that is partnered by a light prickle on the tongue. Drink now.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White
"The name is an oblique reference to Shiraz, which forms the basis of this cuvée. It's inky in hue and rather reticent on the nose at first. But swirl it vigorously and be rewarded with layers of cassis, blackberry and black pepper. Full bodied, rich and tannic, its blueberry and cassis fruit lingers on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink 2015–2025.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend

"This brilliant wine is dry and tart in acidity, minerally, and supremely refined in Meyer lemons, pears, limes and tart apples.

With quite strong structure, this will smooth and grow more delicious with time. Drink 2018–2028.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This features aromas of oak, coffee, vanilla and dried black cherry. Oak carries over to the palate, delivering espresso, licorice, roasted nut and vanilla but not much fruit richness. Astringent tannins give it a mouth drying finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This is a stalky wine, full of black-currant fruits and with just enough weight to balance tannins and the dry structure. It has the potential to become an attractive, fruity wine, so drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Much care goes into this blend, which was fermented both in neutral wood and in stainless steel. Just 10% went through malolactic. It's a light, clean, well-defined effort, offering accents of salad greens, celery and lemon verbena around crisp apple fruit flavors.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"This is the first Dineen designate from :Nota Bene, and it's worth chasing down. Focused dark purple and black fruits line up—cherry, plum and cassis—with a rich layer of espresso and a lick of graphite following. The 22 months in barrel brings an interesting hint of caramel to a nicely balanced finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made from a blend of five indigenous grapes from Abruzzo and Puglia (Montepulciano, Primitivo, Sangiovese, Negroamaro and Malvasia), this is a soft and luscious wine, with generous aromas of ripe fruit, spice and moist tobacco. There's a sweet spot on the finish followed by thickly extracted but soft tannins.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"This is a rich, opulent wine with ripe lychee flavors. Forward and spicy, it is showing its flashy youth at the moment. While it will always be ripe in style, as it develops, it will become more sophisticated and complex. Drink until 2022.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"Strawberry flavor dominates this light and crisp wine. With its brisk acidity and slightly herbal character, it's fresh edging towards green.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"The Gun Metal red is a Bordeaux-style blend—a smooth, seamless mix of spicy red fruits with new barrel highlights of coffee grounds, toasted walnuts and baking spices. There's a lick of citrus running through it also, a testament to the natural acidity that adds life and lift to Washington state reds.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The Boissieu family produces a style of Beaujolais that is rich, packed with fruit and with a structure that allows for some aging. This wine, from a certified biodynamic vineyard, has black plum skin and cherry flavors along with a tight aftertaste that will soften. Drink from 2016.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Lots of white flowers, from jasmine to lilies, show on the nose of this well-priced bottling, alongside poached pears and lime sorbet. The palate packs tangy pungency, with Anjou pear and Granny Smith apple flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Aromas of white currant and green pear are combined with accents of pine and citrus blossom in this blend of Vidal Blanc, Traminette, Viognier and Petite Manseng. The medium-bodied palate tastes off-dry (50g/L residual sugar), and the acidity feels tempered by the sweetness. It finishes with a tropical fruit flavor, a tang of minerality and energy.",US-Virginia-White Blend
"Theoretically a very light rosé, the “Eye of the Partridge” is really a Pinot Noir blanc in this vintage, and joins a growing cohort of such wines from Oregon. Strong acids compete with some residual sugar, in a tart and sappy wine chock full of yellow plum, white raspberries and citrus fruit. It's rich and delicious, with impressive length and concentration.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"There is just a touch of sweetness here, with apricot and nut flavors offering ripeness and a soft, full-in-the-mouth character. The wine has a light touch, and should be a delicious apéritif wine, or try it paired with Chinese food.",France-Southwest France-Gros Manseng
"This vineyard selection captures the defining character of this tiny AVA—an underlying streak of gun metal, and an overall austerity that belies the complexity and subtle length of the wine. Tart cranberry fruit brings supporting acidity, and the wine rewards your attention with extra length and detail. Drink 2018 to 2028.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A sound wine, dry and full-bodied, that can't quite shake off its country-cousin personality. With strong tannins and berry-cherry and herb flavors, all it needs is a rich cheeseburger to make it happy.",US-California-Syrah
"Apple juice, pineapple and honey provide the central aromas, with a bit of citrus on the edges. It's lean and mean on the palate, with fresh apple and pear cider flavors picking up some lemon before showing off a greener, tarter, slightly unripe side.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This young release carries strong scents and flavors of cranberry, along with the sharp acidic attack that implies, which qualifies it as a good choice for many fatty dishes. It's rather simple, fruity, with no hint of new oak. Drink up while it's young and fresh.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Smoky and soft, this full-bodied, rounded wine tastes of baked raspberry and vanilla, its texture velvety and likably smooth. Concentrated, it retains only moderate acidity, peaking in freshness on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This structured wine discloses dark tannins and a firm, dense character. The granite soil comes through strongly in the cool minerality and tight texture. It has weight and potential richness, but it does need to age. Drink from 2016.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Given the price this is pretty good stuff. It's plush and offers enough body and ripe fruit to offset the fact that there isn't a whole lot of structure or backbone. For a soft, tasty plum-and-herb style of Carmenère, however, it gets the job done.",Chile-Maule Valley-Carmenère
"This wine has the variety's trademark notes of herb, green bell pepper, with a woodsy qulaity. This is a full-bodied effort, bearing a long, spicy finish.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"This ripe, jammy wine is all about fruit. Its red berry flavors burst from the glass and are gently backed by tannins. It is already attractive, ripe and full. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A good Zin, if a little rugged in tannins, with briary, wild blackberry, currant, chocolate and spice flavors that finish dry and tannic. A drawback is some slight unripeness that reveals itself as a hint of vegetable. Drink now.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Pear blossom, baked lemons, packed lemon flowers, apple juice, walnut and a touch of quinine pop on the nose of this wine from a challenging grape. The palate is rich but zesty with walnut oil, chamomile, lime, apple and pear notes, offering lots of textural intrigue.",US-California-Roussanne
"Meant to reflect the three elements of terroir, nature and man, this small-production wine is well represented in compost, dried herb, mild tannin and oak. The acidity is moderate and in some ways disjointed, while the finish features highlights of vanilla and currant.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A powerful and concentrated blend of Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Aragonez. Solid blackberry flavors give the wine strength, while tannins and hot pepper bring out bitterness and spice. It's not a wine for the faint-hearted.",Portugal-Península de Setúbal-Portuguese Red
"Chardonnay is an important part of the landscape in the Sézanne area south of Epernay. This ripe, toasty wine has a rich, warm take on the grape. Almonds and hazelnuts mingle with peach and pear flavors giving a creamy character. The bottling is ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"Timpune (100% Grillo) is a full-bodied Sicilian white wine that boasts summertime notes of apricot, nectarine, cantaloupe melon and fragrant acacia flower. The mouthfeel is broad, creamy and fat, suggesting a pairing with fried mozzarella or salads with thick Ranch dressing.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Grillo
"Winemaker Ryan Deovlet isn't afraid of prominent oak, so this comes on with a luscious butterscotch nose, and it immediately smells like it will be a silky wine. It is, with accents of vanilla and a touch of bitterness, but the overriding flavor is smokiness, reminiscent of the rustic Mexican liquor, Mezcal. This could easily handle pork carnitas.",US-California-Rhône-style White Blend
"Soft and accessible, this pushes pretty cherry fruit forward with pleasant notes of toast and mocha. Fermented with native yeast, it has an extra dollop of texture and detail.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"The nose merely hints at tropical riches. The stony palate also holds tightly onto its fruit: it is only zesty citrus that can be divined amidst all the stone. Bright lemon shines above what seems a deep dark core of rocky earth. There is real drive and real energy in that bright, lemony vein that runs right through this dry, serious and almost brooding wine. The finish adds a touch of a more mellow apple note that persists throughout the long finish. Wait for this. Drink 2020–2035.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Made from old vines, this concentrated wine has weight and a tight, mineral texture. Pears and hints of yellow fruits combine with acidity and a contrasting touch of honey. Drink from 2015.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Here is a fresh and zippy Pinot Bianco with immediate aromas of peach, white melon, kiwi and chopped basil leaves. The wine has personality and dimension and at the base of it is thick texture.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Bianco
"Streaked with acidity as well as rich, sweet fruits, this is a full and rounded, yet balanced wine with fresh flavors of honey and apricot. This wine could age, so drink now and until 2019.",Austria-Burgenland-Chardonnay
"This Premier Cru vineyard lies north of the Grand Crus, with a west-facing exposure. It has yielded a wine with soft, generous floral character, ripe yellow fruit and a crisp, mineral edge. Finely sculpted and ageworthy, it will be best from 2019.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A tremendous wine that easily merits being Barnett's most expensive release. Shows the ripe blackberry and black currant flavors and new oak that are so easily achieved, with yet near perfect tannins and a dryness unusual in a Cabernet this fruity. The combination of opposites makes this mountain wine noteworthy, as well as ageable. Now–2017.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of red fruit, cherry meat, herb and pencil lead are followed by full fruit flavors. It pulls up on the finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Three-fifths Merlot, one quarter Cab Franc and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend shows ripe fruit scents of raisin and prune, offset with baking spices and plenty of chocolate and espresso. Full-throttle, smooth and concentrated, it's a big, concentrated, somewhat in-your face-effort, but delicious all the way through.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Abundant flavors combine with a plush texture to make a wine that slowly builds interest from the first sniff to the lingering aftertaste. Hints of vanilla and honeysuckle enhance the vivid apricot flavors, lasting long on the viscous palate and through the finish.",US-California-Viognier
"Slightly earthy and herbal, as Somontano reds are prone to be, with a gritty mouthfeel and sweet black fruit flavors that come with proper herbal accents. Tastes roasted and toasty, with pepper and heat on the lusty finish. Balanced and good; drink now through 2013.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"The aromatic opening suggests tea and tobacco, while the palate is packed with blackberry, black cherry and cassis fruit. This wine has density and complexity yet it's smooth, superrich, toasty and chocolaty. It manages to retain a sense of finesse along with all that power.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Lighter, leaner flavors like cranberry, rhubarb and tart cherry light up this wine from the first sniff through the tangy finish. Balanced on the fresher, crisper side of the spectrum, it has firm tannins, an appetizing dry texture and medium body. The focused fruit flavors and light spicy accents make it distinctive.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a delicious expression of the genre, medium bodied and forcefully crisp, with delicate lacings of cherry, apricot and peach. The underlying hint of vanilla gives it a welcome succulence and touch of sweetness though the wine otherwise presents dry.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is the first release from Cadence's estate vineyard, a 94/6 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc. Sharp and intense, the nose brings out tightly wound red fruit scents, annotated with leaf and white pepper. In this inaugural vintage the Cabernet Sauvignon clearly dominates. A supple, muscular, focused wine with the structure to develop nicely for up to a decade.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Standard Napa Valley Chardonnay, with citrus, peach and herb flavors, enriched with all the bells and whistles of oak, malolactic fermentation and lees aging, and balanced with brisk, lemony acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Slightly muted tones of black cherry and plum preserves are accented by wet soil, mushroom and coconut in this rustic yet elegant Cabernet Franc. Ripe fruit is contrasted by vibrant acidity, rigid tannins and a pleasant bite of astringency that persists through the finish. Drink now through 2022.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"Made with Nerello Mascalese, this opens with aromas of flint, ripe orchard fruit and a whiff of baked bread. The dry palate shows red apple, flint, lemon drop and Mediterranean herb alongside bright acidity and a persistent, elegant perlage.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nerello Mascalese
"With its bright pink color and fruity acidity, this is a candy-flavored, crisp wine. It is as bright in its flavors as it is in its color. It is light and ready to drink.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"The village of Clisson is the home of the Perraud family and also its own mini-appellation. This rich wine is full of fruit, developing a nut and pepper character that adds complexity. It is a well-balanced wine, still with its acidity and a crisp lemon aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"This is a wine for aging. The tannins are dense, very dry with a feel of extraction. It takes a while for the black currant fruit to show through, with acidity and freshness dominant. The wine is still settling, and time will bring the fruit into line with the tannins.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Light honey on red apple and apple blossom aromas show on this blend of 42% Viognier, 30% Grenache Blanc, 23% Marsanne and 5% Roussanne. The flavors combine honey brittle with lemon skins, ripe Borsch pear and a warmer yellow melon fruit element.",US-California-Rhône-style White Blend
"Fred Brander and winemaker Fabian Bravo study Sauvignon Blanc through several bottlings each year, but this Santa Ynez Valley appellation cuvee is an early favorite for 2013. Delicate flinty notes on the nose are bolstered with honey dew and apple. The palate leads with a lot of zing that evolves into flavors of kiwi and pear, with a slightly buttery, almost vanilla finish.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"The 20% Malbec in the blend helps to produce the spicy tannins and dark color of this wine. The other grapes in the blend add richness and firm structure, plus a blackberry-driven juiciness. With its bright acidity added to the mix, this is a serious wine with good aging potential.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Smooth and creamy in texture, this rounded wine is cut easily by acidity, with a tangy background that gives a more mineral edge. With its fresh aftertaste, this is ready to drink. In the Thienpont family since 1946, Nicolas has been the winemaker and a key mover in this appellation since 1983.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Attractive, softly fruity wine, with rounded wood flavors, a solid core of tannins and ripe blackberry fruits. A touch of licorice adds some spice.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"This solid value wine would pair perfectly with pizza. An easy expression of Syrah, the wine is soft and silky, with simple, fruity layers of blueberry and cherry.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Syrah
"This is lightly herbal and beautifully complex. The fruit is a sweetly ripe mix of boysenberry and blueberry, notched with highlights of pepper and leaf. Everything is supported with perfectly proportioned acids and fine-tuned tannins.",US-Washington-Syrah
"While the wine is very sweet, the sweetness does not stand out as much as the intense spiciness. It's a gorgeous wine without excess, textured and with minerality. The aftertaste has a light touch of acidity. It's impressive now, although it will be better from 2018.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Very rich in oak and ripe fruit, with kiwi, lime, pineapple and fig flavors that finish crisp and dry. The oak really stands out with its blast of buttered toast, caramel and woodspice.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This Syrah-based blend of five different red grapes may be “big” in blending components, but it's quite sleek and elegant on the palate. It's not a deeply concentrated brooding wine, but brisk and spry, offering fresh black-cherry and berry flavors. Soft feathery tannins and notes of cedar and forest floor linger on the finish.",US-New York-Red Blend
"Tasting similar to Chardonnay, this has a buttery, creamy texture that frames orange, citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It gains extra points for delicacy and balance. The appellation is in San Benito County, about 25 miles inland from Monterey.",US-California-Pinot Blanc
"This fairly rich and heavy rosé is produced and bottled for Xavier Flouret by Domaine de Rimauresq. It does have attractive peach and melon aromas, but the flavors are weighty in the mouth and could use a touch more zest and zip on the finish. Best with meaty dishes. A blend of 45% Cinsault, 25% Tibouren, 25% Grenache and 5% Syrah.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Quite light in the glass, this bottling immediately shows a stony minerality on the nose as well as touches of sea salt, baked apple and nectarine. The palate pops with a savory, briny character, giving depth to the pear, Gravenstein apple and caramel flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This soft and creamy wine is rounded and with a ripe red-berry character. It is verging on off dry, producing a wine that is all fruit with just a tang of acidity to give it a lift at the end. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Sparkling Blend
"Like the brand name implies, this is a wine for everyday drinking. It's dry and light in body, with uncomplicated sour-cherry candy, sage and toast flavors.",US-California-Red Blend
"There is a high level of wood here, but that is sustained by the weight of the black fruits and the rich tannins. The wood gives a vanilla character that will disappear in a year or two, leaving a solid wine that is dominated by ripe, sweet Merlot.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This opens up with a heady fragrance of apricot and Spanish broom. The palate offers fleshy peach and juicy lemon flavors, along with notes of pineapple and almond that support the wine's bright acidity.",Italy-Central Italy-Verdicchio
"Here's a very rich and intense expression of Barbera d'Alba with aromas of black fruit, toasted nut, vanilla bean, espresso and cherry cola. It's a modern, smooth wine that would pair with lasagna or rolled pork with prune.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"Careful winemaking balances the fruit and oak perfectly in this lovely, medium-weight wine. It's polished and steely, with just-ripe apple and pear fruit, braced with racy, lemony acidity and a streak of minerality. It was fermented in 100% French oak, one sixth new.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Harrison's Cabernet is a bit hard in youth, marked by strong tannins that make for an astringent mouthfeel. It's also somewhat linear in varietal flavor, with ripe black currants and blackberries and a certain minerality. Not drinkable now, but all indications are for a good future. Better after 2012.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"With sweet flavors of honey, lemons and limes, this is a likeable Sauvignon Blanc. A fine burst of citrusy acidity provides needed balance.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is ultraripe and a bit raisiny on the nose, but there are encouraging flashes of schisty minerality and freshness. It feels jammy, full bodied and thick, with a baked black-fruit flavor and notes of licorice and tobacco. Smooth and earthy on the finish, with power to spare. Drink now–2014.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Delicate hints of crushed mineral and white flower linger in this dry appley Riesling. Soft acidity lends a slightly broad, flat feel to the palate but the finish is clean and crisp.",US-New York-Riesling
"Aged for seven years before disgorging, this deliciously mature wine is full of Pinot Noir richness. It has a warm character that seems to be the style of this producer in the Côte de Sézanne. Named after the king who created the French monarchy, the wine has toast, almonds and a generous, creamy aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"It's hard to find a favorite within Dr. Loosen's excellent line up of 2015 auslese, but this bottling stands out for its kaleidoscope of fruit, floral and earthen complexities. Sumptuous and ripe, fleshy white peach and grapefruit flavors undulate on the palate. It's finely framed, edged by sharp lines of slate, spine-tingling acidity and swathes of fennel and earth. The finish feels fragile, laced in sweetness and lingering.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Some flinty reduction still hovers over the glass, underneath, riper, appetizing fruit like peach and yellow plum shimmers. There is a fresh, textured phenolic edge and brightening acidity which pulls everything in to a clear, taut focus. This is full of flavor and depth.",Austria-Kremstal-Riesling
"This expresses the greatness of its vintage and vineyard, offering wave after wave of raspberry and cherry pie flavors, plus notes of red currant, sweet licorice, spicy Dr. Pepper and smoky sandalwood. There's also something exotically briary and wild that intrigues. Even more remarkable is the texture, an amalgam of acids and tannins that rivals any Pinot Noir ever produced in California. It should age for up to 20 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The aromas bring plenty of appeal, with notes of coffee, herbs, vanilla and woodspice. However the concentration of the cherry flavors doesn't seem entirely there, tapering toward the finish where the oak takes over.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Complex from start to finish, beginning with aromas of smoke, kumquats and grilled pears and ending cleanly, with tart pineapple notes. The texture is a compelling mix of gravel and custard, yet the wine never seems heavy.",New Zealand-Hawke's Bay-Chardonnay
"This is a basic but nice Chardonnay with lightly oaked aromas of pear, apple and tropical fruits. The palate is fresh and healthy, while apple, mango and peach flavors settle with a hint of bitter matchstick and leftover tropical notes.",Chile-Maule Valley-Chardonnay
"From 1800-foot vineyards, this is a crisp, cool, simply fruity wine that has great citrus and lemon character. Very aromatic, with green herb and fresh grapefruit zest over apple juice.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"Sweeter than in the past, this blend of Cabernet, Merlot, Sangiovese and Cab Franc has overtly sugary flavors of blackberry and cherry pie filling that are not appropriate in a table wine.",US-California-Red Blend
"89–91. Barrel sample. This is a ripe and fruity wine with delicious, already-accessible black-currant fruit. Attractive and very forward.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A lesson in contrasts: the nose is both weedy and sweet, with green strawberry aromas mixing with caramel. The palate is also green and slightly bitter, but that's offset by some jammy berry sweetness. Medium in terms of weight, but with burdensome sugars and a clumsy finish.",Spain-Levante-Tempranillo
This is an easy-drinking Faugères with lively accents of thyme and crushed purple florals to the ripe red fruit core. The mouth is vibrant and mouthwatering with strong acidity and a clean but somewhat tart finish. Drink now.,France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is a nicely blended mix of 37% Zinfandel with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah, Syrah, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. The kitchen-sink effort rewards in juicy red fruit, herbal, cedar accents and medium-bodied weight and tannin strength. The finish is lengthy in vanilla and smoke.",US-California-Red Blend
"This ripe, fruity wine is developing a fine balance between fruit and structure. Its black currant flavors are bright, juicy and crisp, sustained by a core of dryness and delicious acidity. It will benefit from another year of age, so wait until late 2018 before drinking.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Fifty-year-old vines on the two opposing slopes of this Grand Cru vineyard come together in this balanced wine. It has a cool mineral character that contrasts with its ripe yellow and pear fruit. Acidity and a tight texture hold the wine together beautifully. Drink from 2020.,France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Soft baking-spice notes mesh with vanilla, red currants, dark chocolate and cranberry on the nose of this bottling. There's a cinnamon and nutmeg spice to the palate, where hibiscus, more cranberry and red cherry also shows.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is an elegant edition of the Henry Estate Pinot Noir. It has shed its rusticity in favor of a delicate expression of varietal character. Crushed rose petals, wild raspberries and a dash of pepper are backed with stiff tannins. Give it another year to fully come together.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This tastes like a candy bar, with flavors of melted cherry jam and milk chocolate. Some overripe fruit shows up in the form of a raisin flavor.",US-California-Grenache
"This is one of a collection of Champagnes tasted and approved by a group of growers under the Special Club label. With a predominance of Chardonnay, it's still crisp and fruity, showing rich apple and pear flavors. Its citrusy acidity gives it lift, slowing any signs of maturity. It will continue to age gracefully but is delicious now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Perfumed aromas are forced and less than natural. This feels about right, with citric acidity maintaining balance. Flavors of candied orange and cantaloupe finish with obvious residual sugar along with modest acidic cut.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"With firm tannins allied to smooth wood flavors, this young wine is going to develop its fruitiness over the next year. It has a ripe body, black fruits in the back waiting to come forward. Wait to drink until 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine commands attention with its aromas of dark raspberries, milk chocolate and barrel spices. Flavors show plenty of richness and intensity with a supple texture that dazzles.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Red berry, cedar and light spice aromas lead the way on this dazzling red. The vibrant palate is loaded with finesse, delivering bright red currant, red raspberry, white pepper and chopped herb alongside bright acidity and firm, polished tannins. Impeccably balanced, it's loaded with elegance, energy and intensity but it's still young, so give it time to fully develop. Drink 2020–2038.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Oak, herb, fennel, hay and wild berry aromas lead the nose. The firm palate offers Morello cherry, oak, cinnamon, clove, Mediterranean herb and a confectionary note alongside tightly knit and austere tannins that need to unwind. Drink 2018–2030.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Melon, Animal Cracker and tropical fruit aromas lead to a plump but solidly fresh palate. A mix of stone-fruit and pink-grapefruit flavors is chiseled, and tastes a touch peppery on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Rosé

"This is winemaker Ross Cobb's own family project, from extremely cool sites along the Sonoma Coast, including the family's own Coastlands vineyard. Here, with Rice-Spivak, he skirts the edge of ripeness, producing a light, bright wine that's at first hard to penetrate. Faint notes of tart cherry and pomegranate weave through like a fog, a seasoning of allspice on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Saline, lime, grass, bell pepper and green bean aromas swirl around the bouquet on this fresh, coastal SB. This feels round yet crisp, with modest acidic cut and flavors or orange, passion fruit and minerals. Finishing flavors are similar, with a hint of green herb.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is the first Chardonnay release from Anam Cara, estate grown from young vines, and softened by secondary fermentation. The flavors suggest almond and butter, light citrus, a whiff of toast and a taste of cracker. It's smooth, with a lemony finish.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Clear, well-defined varietal scents of pepper, licorice and boysenberry cut through, with a hint of fresh-cut tobacco. A substrate of granite underscores this ripe, supple, medium-long wine with good grip and a polished mouthfeel. Drink 2015 through 2020.",US-Oregon-Syrah

There are touches of vanilla and almonds to add complexity. The wine is ready to drink.",Portugal-Dão-Encruzado
"This youthful wine will benefit from further time in bottle, but its full-bodied concentration is heady for now, a punchy, temperamental mix of sweet peach, vanilla bean and medium acidity. Intense on the nose and palate, it displays a quite ripe personality.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Pungent and a little pickled on the nose, with oak and cream coming on a second wave. The palate is composed, normal in feel and shows slightly choppy cherry and berry flavors. Regular but short on the finish. Good wine; nothing more than that.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Tasty and rich, but the structure is more like a Rhône wine than Pinot Noir. It's dark and heavy, with cherry pie filling, cola and sandalwood flavors. Curiously soft for an Edna Valley wine. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Lean, spicy aromas set up a smoky, plum-filled palate that's probably a bit too toasty for its own good. The body weight here is moderate, but there's lots of length to the smoke-filled, oak-driven finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"There's a bright, lively nature to this Prosecco Extra Dry that is enhanced by aromas of butterscotch, lemon drop and apricot. Sweet fruit flavors are followed by soft creamy foaming.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"A blend of 97% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Petit Verdot, this wine speaks to power, offering juicy, velvety texture around brawny components of leather, coffee and black plum. Concentrated and intense, it needs time to open in the glass before pairing with thick cuts of meat.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Wiry plum and earthy cherry aromas announce a lively, medium-bodied Tempranillo with plum and raspberry flavors. A light, solid, adequately fruity finish is clean and tasty.",Spain-Levante-Tempranillo

"Yeasty funk hangs heavy on the nose and will need time to clear. The palate underneath, however, shines with a cool, composed and serene brightness.

"For anyone who wants to walk the walk of low-alcohol wines, this is a place to start, a 12.5% alcohol blend of Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier, Muscat Canelli, Gewürztraminer and Orange Muscat all grown in the Livermore Valley. This wine has inviting notes of toffee, vanilla and caramel and will make a welcome companion at any backyard barbecue or casual dinner party.",US-California-White Blend
"Dominated by Vermentinu, this is a rich while crisp wine. With its fresh apple flavors and good acidity, it is deliciously perfumed, ripe and poised with a strong line in minerality. Drink from 2017.",France-France Other-White Blend
"Allspice, cinnamon cookies and nutmeg kick off the nose of this bottling, then come turned earth and blueberry fruit. Hearty blueberry and blackberry fruits show on the sip alongside coffee grinds and cooked meats. It's quite hearty in structure, but fruity all around.",US-California-Barbera
"Closed up tightly, this wine is not yet entirely ready to reveal its charms. Over time it offers aromas of blackberry, huckleberry, bittersweet chocolate, barrel spices and mineral. True to the house style, it pulls no punches with creamy feeling, rich black and blue fruit flavors that sail into the distance. Give it time to open up.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Wild cherry, ripe strawberry, graphite, clove and licorice sensations emerge in this elegant red. It's well balanced and already enjoyable thanks to supple tannins and fresh acidity. It will provide easy-drinking pleasure over the next few years. Enjoy through 2017.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This wine comes from the San Lucas area of the southern Salinas Valley, on the way toward Paso Robles. It's a peppery wine, rustic, hot and dry, with strong jammy flavors of cherries and blackberries, and a long, spicy finish. Drink now.",US-California-Syrah
"Cherries galore on this easy, pretty red: the palate adds appetizing sprays of white pepper to the crunchy, moreish fruit, leaving you with a just about medium-bodied red of immense bounce and freshness. This embodies the fruity, joyful nature of Zweigelt perfectly and makes for effortless sipping.",Austria-Burgenland-Zweigelt
"Dark and thick, this full-bodied wine from the Sierra region brings truckloads of jammy fruit flavors along with a firm texture that doesn't overly tighten the tannic grip. The blackberry and black-cherry notes are simply delicious.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Franc, this nonvintage wine displays aromas of vanilla, green pepper, woodspice and herbs. The sweet chocolate and cherry flavors are accented by light meaty notes.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this is a good, smooth wine that shows its Napa origins in the ripeness of fruit and classy tannins. Floods the mouth with blackberries and oak. There's a certain sharpness that cuts through the richness and lasts through the finish, which may limit ageability, so drink soon.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Each of the three varieties in the blend brings its own unique contribution. Zinfandel, the majority, gives spicy wild-berry flavors and robust body. Cabernet Sauvignon lends its firm tannins and deep black-currant flavors, while Merlot adds a soft, sensual mouthfeel. The resulting wine is easy to drink now with almost anything calling for a full-bodied dry red wine.",US-California-Red Blend
"The Paso producer heads a bit north to produce this wine. Aromas suggest browned butter, lemon slices, pan-seared peach and a bit of smoke, with some steely aromatic backbone. The palate is consumed by lemon blossoms and buttered toast.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A rich gold color and spicy, complex aromas get this wine off to a great start. It follows with ginger, cinnamon, baked apple and lemon on the palate, which sets up a layered flavor profile supported by fine bubbles and fresh acidity. The finish lingers on slightly nutty and doughy notes. Enjoy through 2022.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"A very ripe, rather high alcohol blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah and Grenache that's superrich in fruit, but lacks some elegance and finesse. Flatters the palate with flavors of blackberry and cherry pie filling, cassis, chocolate, anise and pepper. Probably not an ager, so drink with a nice grilled pork chop.",US-California-Red Blend
"Made from 100% Cabernet Franc, this richly extracted wine offers fragrant aromas of Indian spice and sandalwood followed by black fruit, cinnamon and cardamom. It's plush, rich and firm, with a dense tobacco aftertaste.",Italy-Tuscany-Cabernet Franc
"Kreuth is a sophisticated, oak-aged Chard from the mountainous north of Italy that delivers a creamy, rich structure and beautiful aromas of pineapple, mature peach, honey and almond. The wine is dense and satisfying and would pair with roasted artichoke or lime marinated chicken with cilantro.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Chardonnay
"Aromas of underbrush, menthol and a whiff of cellar floor carry over to the palate, along with dried cherry and licorice. Astringent tannins provide support.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Sophisticated and complex, this brings well-structured layers of citrus juice, flesh and rind. It offers a delicate herbal touch and a lingering finish. As the wine evolves in the glass, a tasty hint of honeysuckle emerges.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Complex and solid, it holds rich berry fruits, a darkly tannic structure, dense texture and a juicy acidity. This firm wine has a good future, so don't drink before 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A simple, jammy-smelling wine with cherry aromas and a whiff of citrus too. Young, vibrant, acidic and juicy on the palate, with energetic but rubbery berry and plum flavors. Good yet basic wine overall, with heat on the finish.",Argentina-Other-Malbec
"This Cabernet delivers a complete package at an incredibly attractive price. Aromas of mocha, graphite and vanilla play nicely with core berry scents. Baked berry, vanilla and pastry flavors settle softly, with mellow tannins. Drink through 2018.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is half Funk Estate Vineyard Syrah, with the rest McClellan Estate Cabernet Sauvignon. The two varieties somewhat seem to cancel each other out initially, with aromas of smoked meat, cherry, herb and earth that don't seem fully resolved. The palate brings a smooth, elegant styling to the red and blue-fruit flavors. There's plenty of interest, but it doesn't all entirely come together at present.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This is nice and dry, with a silky texture, firm acidity and classic cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors. But it finishes on the slender side.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Here's a simple little wine that makes for pleasant drinking at an affordable price. It's lemony and dry and soft in acids, but it is very clean and is fine for fried chicken, fruit salad and other picnic-type fare. —S.H.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of white peach and apple come with mild oak notes. This feels melony and full, with its body weight dictated by tropical fruits. Briny, salty tropical fruit and corn flavors finish with a lasting note of oak.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"A comforting nose of vanilla toast, butter and a spin of citrus starts this venerable producer's elegant Chardonnay. On the palate, the wine is creamy, with integrated fresh fruit and spice components, and offers a lingering, unctuous finish.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Chardonnay
"Fruity and lemony, this is a bright and fresh wine with just a touch of steeliness. Almonds come through at the end.",Portugal-Bucelas-Arinto
"Almost as big as a Port, but not sweet, this densely concentrated but surprisingly gentle wine offers opulent, ripe and almost jammy berry flavors that coat the palate and cling to the sides of the mouth long after each sip. It's technically dry, but so rich with blackberry and cassis flavors that it seems sweet from the first aroma to the lingering finish. It will be best after 2024.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Tight tannins mask the ripe fruit in a wine that is set for long-term aging, so there is a dry core that dominates at the moment. But not for long: the bold black fruits are insistent and are going to be delicious. This is a structured wine that will be ready in 2026.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Ripe and sweet blackberry jam and dried fig flavors fill out this Port-style sweet wine. Good doses of tannin and acidity keep it structured enough to not feel cloying, lending a little textural grip.",US-California-Port
"Savory, smoked meat and clove aromas give this lively Agiorgitiko soul. Flavors of leather, smoke, spice and red berry are balanced and clean. A masculine pour that will pair well with dried meats, steak and burgers.",Greece-Nemea-Agiorgitiko
"Toasted oak, espresso, new leather and steeped plum aromas waft out of the glass. The bracing palate offers grilled herb, licorice, toast and dried berry flavors, framed by grainy tannins that grip the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Stéphane Brocard is based in Marsannay the northernmost vineyard in Burgundy's Côte d'Or. This wine comes from two small parcels with 35-year-old vines. It is already fruity and attractive, although the tannins do promise aging. Crisp with the pure acidity of the vintage, it will develop well and should be drunk from late 2017.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Defines Russian River Valley Pinot Noir in the dryness, silkiness and full-bodied richness, with flavors of cherries, pomegranates, raspberries and slightly underripe persimmons. This complex wine grows better as it warms in the glass. Drink over the next 2–3 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A blend of fruit from Elephant Mountain, Dionysus, Red Haven, Alder Ridge and Seven Hills vineyards, this fruit-forward wine offers aromas of cocoa, vanilla, anise, raspberry jam and fruit leather. The cranberry and raspberry flavors are sweet, rich and concentrated, backed by lightly grainy tannins. It seems a bit advanced for its age but brings a delicious factor that is hard to ignore. Drink now.",US-Washington-Merlot
"This ripe and fruity wine has an edge of tannins to give it structure. It's full of juicy black fruits, rich berry flavors and fresh acidity. The wine will age as the tannins round out further, so drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Roussanne is really hard to pull off in California, but if anyone can do it, Zaca Mesa can. It's as good as the 2007, showing nectarine, pear and tangerine flavors, with the creamy, yeasty complexities of a fine barrel-fermented Chardonnay. It's dry and crisp in acidity and even has a fine, steely minerality. Drink now.",US-California-Roussanne
"This radiates fragrance and spice: ferns and pepper, yeast and juicy, yellow pear, mirabelle plums and aloe vera. All of this is on both the nose and the palate and is combined in a harmonious, balanced parcel of rounded goodness. It treads a fine line between opulence and freshness but does not stray from its perfect high wire act.",Austria-Wagram-Grüner Veltliner
"Fresh and fruity, it shows crispness as well as white fruits, orange zest and a lively lemon aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This wine's intense berry aromas are followed by equally deep flavors, as its meaty, earthy, spicy nuances develop with each sip. It has complexity, concentration, a very smooth texture and that certain wild element that's attractive in Syrah.",US-California-Syrah
"As with Kiona's off-dry Washington Riesling, this includes a bit of Gewürztraminer, a clever addition that brings some spiciness into play. Intensely aromatic, the wine is almost Muscat-like, with dense orange peel flavors, along with citrus, tea and madeleine cookie. This is a sensational value from a leading Riesling producer.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Iron and steel, rock and earth are the first things you notice about this mineral-inflected, single-vineyard Merlot. It's an ode to tannin and terroir, a tough, tight and dense wine with primary fruit flavors of cranberry and cassis.",US-Washington-Merlot
"The big, powerful nose showcases blackberry, plum and brambly components. This tight, tannic, nicely constructed, ageworthy Cabernet features dark licorice streaks running through the long finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe berry, aromatic herb, rose, violet, anise, leather and a whiff of tobacco all meld together on this firmly structured wine. The full-bodied, gripping palate delivers mature black cherry, licorice, underbrush and dark baking spice alongside youthfully assertive but velvety-textured tannins. Drink 2019–2029.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Sometimes you want the richness of a rosé sparkler, and with this Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend, you get plenty of flavor. Although its dry, it's flamboyant in raspberries, strawberries and vanilla, along with the stimulating yeast of a great bubbly. Just great on its own, or drink with sushi or roast salmon.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"At first the raspberry and plum aromas are stunted and the palate seems round but basic. More airing reveals raspberry, cassis and strawberry flavors. In the end it winds up as a friendly, medium-intensity Cabernet that's good for immediate consumption.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A blend of Ciel du Cheval and Force Majeure vineyards, this wine brings a mix of pomegranate, dark raspberry, dried tobacco, crushed rock and peppery spices. It explodes on the palate with rich, dense, cranberry and spice flavors that linger.",US-Washington-Mourvèdre
"Pale straw in color, this white has aromas of toast and cream that lead to a full-feeling palate backed by a lick of lemony acidity and barrel flavors. It brings enjoyment but it's hard to discern the variety.",US-Washington-Viognier
"This small-batch Merlot (57 cases total) is concentrated up front, with aromas of balsam wood, cigar box, asphalt and hard-charging black fruits. The palate is hard as rocks, with intense but narrow dark-berry flavors in front of a pinched finish loaded with blackberry, pepper and chocolate flavors as well as fierce leftover tannins. Drink through 2020.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Merlot
"This drinkable Pinot does have a tannic toughness. On the palate, there are good notes of cherry and cola, but hints of green unripeness compromise its future. Give it a good decant and drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Rueda is best when it's fresh and dancing, but this 2006 is showing too many signs of the hot year from which it came. It's already tired and soft, with compost and mealy citrus aromas going head to head with grapefruit and marmalade notes. Tasted in December 2007, this was probably a tastier, fresher wine six months prior.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"This yellow-gold wine is packed with bright floral and citrus scents and flavors. It's a mouthful of lemon-drop goodness, with the rough edges smoothed by a percentage aged in neutral oak. The finish features light honey, with a slight burn.",US-Oregon-Viognier
"This is a pretty nice Merlot, soft, smooth and rich in oak-accented cherry pie flavor. It finishes a little sweet; try pairing it with teriyaki chicken or pork.",US-California-Merlot
"This is a straightforward Cabernet that's dry, tannic and soft in acidity, making it fine to drink now. It has easy flavors of blackberries, black currants and cola.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Saint Clair produces some 86,000 cases of this solid Sauvignon Blanc. If it's not quite as rich, concentrated or flamboyant as its Pioneer Block bottlings, it still delivers authentic Marlborough Sauvignon character. Pineapple and tomato leaf notes are well balanced, while the wine is medium bodied and slightly creamy in the mouth.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"This Pinot Noir, named for a particular soil type in the Willamette valley, is scented strongly of the lumber smell you get at a building supplies store. There is a simple but pleasing layer of strawberry/raspberry fruit hidden in the wine's core. Perhaps a year or two of bottle age will pull things together.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A simple, direct Pinot Noir, light and silky in the mouth, with jammy raspberry, cherry, date and brown sugar flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Piercing sour raspberry aromas introduce an edgy, scratchy feeling wine with a combo of minty, herbal pie cherry and red plum flavors. This dries out and finishes modestly, but always with true Pinot Noir character.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir
"A big, chunky wine that begins with pleasant aromas of dark, lush fruit and rose petals, it cannot sustain its promise on the palate. It starts well enough, but by midpalate, most of the fruit has gone, and the finish is short and a little dour.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Like all Alto Moncayo Garnachas, this opens with a big, loud crust of toasty oak and campfire smoke on top of blackberry aromas. The palate offers depth and body, while charred, toasty black-fruit flavors finish peppery and with tolerable heat. Drink through 2021.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"Mineral notes on the nose build in intensity throughout this brisk, invigorating semidry Riesling. Spine-tingling lemon-lime acidity offsets a palate full of luscious yellow peach and honey flavors. Finishes long with a spray of lavender.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"A ripe perfumed wine with fine tannins as well as dense fruit. Blackberry flavors are up there along with the acidity and crisp aftertaste. It's a wine with a good future, ready to drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a ripe wine, packing tannins as well as black fruits into a rich package. Black cherries and black plums are paired with a core of dry tannins. The acidity comes right through to give the wine its potential. The wine comes from a very stony vineyard and this shows in its tight mineral aftertaste. Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This warm-climate Falanghina (a native grape of southern Italy) delivers lively aromas of pear, Golden Delicious apple and stone fruit. The creamy, smooth mouthfeel could match calamari stuffed with breadcrumbs and parsley.",Italy-Southern Italy-Falanghina
"A little big and heavy, but that's the style that Kaiken has pushed since arriving on the market a few years ago. This version has baked-fruit aromas backed by lemon peel and espresso, while the palate is rich, dark and syrupy, but also oaky and tannic. Seems to want to offer more than it can deliver. The 14.5% alcohol level tells you that it's a big boy.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fruity, soft and candied, this high alcohol wine has blackberry and cherry pie filling flavors, with a rustic texture. Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and a few other varieties.",US-California-Cabernet Blend
"Young and tight, this wine is scented with fresh raspberries and cocoa. The fruit flavors include red currant and spicy cherry as well, and it feels sleek and elegant, though confined. The way the wine spreads out across the palate is encouraging, as are the hints of pepper, herb and stone. Decant before drinking.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Bruce McGuire makes a strong case for the potential of Petit Verdot—a variety not often bottled on its own—in the Santa Ynez Valley. Baked blackberry, licorice and cocoa scents show on the playful nose, while black cherry, cocoa dust, cardamom and anise flavors light up the palate.",US-California-Petit Verdot
"A blend of 8 prime vineyards scattered across the appellation, this is a delicately light, but savory, Pinot Noir, the kind that supports food rather than overshadowing it. The cherry, tea, cola, herb and subtle oak flavors are restrained, leading to a dry, balanced finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Weedy and herbal, this Merlot-based blend is thick and rich in black cherry and medium oak, with an abbreviated finish.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Grüner Veltliner is an extreme rarity in the state. Sparkling offerings? Unheard of. This one brings appealing aromas of lime pith, white pepper, autolytic notes and citrus. The palate brings a big blast of acid, drinking quite dry. The acid is intense on its own but it will fit in nicely at the dinner table.",US-Washington-Grüner Veltliner
"Heady yellow flower and honey aromas waft from this sunny, off-dry wine. The palate is concentrated with fresh apple flavors, but pierced with a streak of lime and lemon acidity. Finishes moderately long with a touch of lemon-zest astringency.",US-New York-Riesling
"Neutral on the nose, with peachy sweetness and softness that suggests it's beginning to fade. Feels honest but light, with pithy, neutral melon and red apple flavors. Dry but sort of bland; still upright. Drink right away.",Spain-Northern Spain-Rosé
"This medium-bodied Shiraz features plenty of spicy complexity and creamy-soft tannins, making it ideal for current consumption. Cedar, vanilla and spice accent raspberry fruit and linger elegantly on the finish.",Australia-Western Australia-Shiraz
"Earns its stripes for the sheer power of raspberry and cherry fruit that defines its California ripeness. Firm tannins and acidity fortunately provide balance, and the wine finishes dry. An opulent, extravagent Pinot Noir that will provide lusty drinking over the next six years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Made with 95% Sangiovese and 5% Syrah, this easygoing red opens with aromas that recall red berry, dark spice and blue flower. The fresh palate offers juicy strawberry, cinnamon and a white pepper note alongside bright acidity and silky tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Lemon-lime and lemon curd mark this wine. The lemon theme continues throughout the layers of apple, vanilla and oak, the oak not perceptible until near the round, voluptuous finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This bold, full-bodied wine with lots of fruit flavor seems to have faded a bit. It shows volatile aromas and overripe fruit notes that are getting a bit frayed around the edges.",US-California-Mourvèdre
"At last Failla can use this newl-approved appellation for their estate-grown fruit. The wine is concentrated in raspberry and cherry jam and sweet oak flavors. The acidity associated with this extreme western edge of Sonoma County, so near the ocean, is brisk and stimulating. The flavors are a little candied now, but you might try giving it 4–5 years to see  if it gains bottle complexity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a satisfying Syrah with profound notes of white pepper that ease smoothly from the nose to the palate. Beyond savory, earthy characteristics, there is also bright raspberry too. Priced fairly, there's no reason not to give it a try.",US-California-Syrah
"Made from 100% Pineau d'Aunis (a local grape that originated in Saumur in the 11th century) this is a soft wine. With attractive acidity, red-berry fruits and a gentle texture, the wine is ripe while keeping a backbone of mineral texture. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Rosé
"Smooth, rich and dense with a touch of sweetness, packed with intense flavors of sweet potatoes, pepper and honey. The texture is thick, creamy, weighty and concentrated. One of the library releases of selected wines, produced by Knoll in the best years.",Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
"Fruity plum aromas mingle with dark spice, chopped herb and violet notes on the nose of this full-bodied red. On the palate, fleshy black cherry, clove and anise flavors are set against chewy tannins and fresh acidity. It's already approachable but will also offer years of enjoyment. Drink 2018–2023.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This opens with earthy aromas of ripe dark fruit, scorched earth, game and truffle. The concentrated palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, sweet cake spice, tobacco and herb accompanied by firm, fine-grained tannins and a vein of fresh acidity.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
Pinot Bianco is a fantastic food wine that delivers good density and natural creaminess without being too fragrant or perfumed. This beautiful expression delivers the best that this grape variety awards in an exceedingly crisp and clean package.,Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Bianco
"This has a fine, dense texture, with wood influence that's carefully balanced by the solid tannins. It offers big, bold fruit flavors, with the structure for long-term aging. The finish is smooth and rich.",Austria-Burgenland-Austrian Red Blend
"Pungent, sweaty aromas include match stick and green citrus. Flavors of citrus, melon and green apple mark the palate and finish pithy and bitter, with strong pyrazines.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This 100% Pinot Nero opens with aromas of red berries, rose petals and a whiff of vanilla. The juicy linear palate offers red currants, vanilla and a hint of beets framed in polished tannins. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Nero
"This Pinot Blanc with a small percentage of Pinot Grigio (20%) offers a confectionary aroma that's inviting at first, the wine otherwise crisp, simple and ready to drink now.",US-California-Pinot Blanc
"A heavily wood-aged wine, this wine has smoky, burnt-toast aromas. At the moment, ripe yellow-fruit flavors are submerged beneath this onslaught of wood, but it should integrate better, so give it until 2016.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Forest floor, scorched earth, dark-skinned fruit, menthol and ground clove aromas come together in the glass. On the structured palate, youthfully assertive close-grained tannins support wild cherry, black pepper, licorice and espresso. This is still austere and needs to unwind to show its true potential. Drink 2020–2031.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"It's full-bodied and a little warm (14% alcohol), but this also boasts baked apple and citrus fruit and restrained, pencilly, toasty oak. It's lush and mouthfilling without being overblown; rich without being exotic—a well made New World Chard.",Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"As this is tight and currently aloof, it lacks the generosity of the 2009 vintage, but it may prove to be more ageable. It has deep, earthy flavors of red currant, cola and balsam, and it could blossom into something even more complex after 2016.",US-California-Pinot Noir
Sangiovese (60%) and equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot deliver soft tones of cherry and blackberry with white almond and toasted hazelnut on the close.,Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"One sniff and you will be able to peg this as cool-climate SB. The nose is full of nettle and gooseberry aromas, while the palate feels trim and citrusy. Flavors of gooseberry, nettle and green bean leave a tropical note on the finish. This shows fine acidity but narrow, raw flavors.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aged in older American and French oak barrels for approximately one year, this lacks the fruit to stand up to the bitter tannins. It's green and short, with little fruit flavor.",Canada-British Columbia-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of purple flower and wild berry lead the nose on this blend of 60% Sangiovese, 22% Merlot, 10% Canaiolo 5% Petit Verdot and 3% Colorino. The easy-drinking, chewy palate doles out black raspberry, Morello cherry, black pepper and baking spice alongside polished tannins. Drink through 2017.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"From Clare Ranch Vineyard in the Templeton Gap, this bottling by Ryan Render shows rounded notes of boysenberry and cooked blackberry on the nose alongside strong licorice and mocha aromas. Blackberry and boysenberry also arise on the sip, with olive, pepper and pretty violet floral flavors, all framed by a solidly dry structure.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Spicy notes of angelica and an inviting, earhty warmth characterize this wine which is more slender and textured on the palate than the nose might have suggested. There is a nervy, slender core with fine acidity.",Austria-Südsteiermark-Sauvignon Blanc
"This lovely 100% varietal wine aged just under two years in 80% new French oak shows a strong spicy clove character that's layered with cranberry and cherry fruit. Dusty mocha and integrated oak notes meet crisp acidity, maintaining freshness through all that power.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Apricot fuzz and grapefruit burst first in this white, surrounded by handfuls of generously high-toned tangerine. The oak presence is minimal, providing texture without impeding flavor. Refreshing, the wine's finish suggests thyme and lemon verbena. Under 10% Sémillon is also in the blend.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Spice and lanolin notes are curious and enticing on the nose and palate of this sunny and sweet, but impeccably balanced Riesling. Juicy, supple, apple jelly and quince flavors are offset by striking acidity and steely minerality that reverberate on the finish.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Visellio is a pretty wine from one of the most promising wineries in Puglia. It opens with an inky dark color and shows balance and harmony, with aromas of ripe blackberry and exotic spice. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety.",Italy-Southern Italy-Primitivo
"Smoky blackberry aromas introduce a blocky, ripe, chewy palate with full-force weight, extraction and tannins. Bold flavors of baking spices, clove, blackberry and plum end with chocolaty notes. This is a ripe, globular wine with definition and clarity to go with powerful, ripe flavors. Drink through 2024.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"For the vintage, which generally provided rather ripe fruit, this is a bit tight and stiffly tannic. The cherry cobbler aromas and flavors are certainly pleasurable, but finish crisp and firm. Give it a few years in the cellar, and drink 2017–2023.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This top wine from a major Cahors estate shows the potential of great Malbec. With its dense tannins, rich black fruit flavors, acidity and restrained power, it is a major force. Even with all its weight, it's stylish, complex and ageworthy wine. Drink from 2021.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Sourced entirely from the Winter's Hill vineyard, this is a lively mix of raspberry, lime, pineapple and cherry candy. Young and tart, it needs more time to flesh out and show more detail. Currently the baking spice accents from aging in one-third new oak, appealing as they are, stick out a bit. Give this until 2016 or so to bottle age.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Barrantes is always a full-bodied Albariño from one of Rias Baixas's warmest subzones. The nose on the '07 is of doughnuts and pastry, with sweet pear kicking in. The flavors are peach, apricot and ripe citrus fruits, and the finish is pithy and wide. Plods along a bit; could stand to be lighter and smoother in scope.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"A healthy dose of potpourri and lavender kick off the nose of this bottling, with sweet pine, plum and raspberry waves inviting one in for repeat sniffs. Cedar, sandalwood and incense touches show on the palate, where tangy plum fruit and roasting herbs start to delve toward the olive and Mediterranean spice rack as well.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Aromas suggesting honeysuckle, citrus blossom, honeydew melon, aromatic herb and a whiff of tomato vine lead the way. The round, medium-bodied palate is full of grapefruit, white peach and mature Bosc pear while a mineral note closes the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Arneis
"Here's a stunning sparkler that opens with delicately enticing scents of white spring blossom, ripe orchard fruit and a hint of Alpine herb.

Bright acidity lends freshness while a creamy perlage gives it tons of finesse.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sparkling Blend
"Here's a luminous and crystalline white wine in a screwcap bottle with linear and direct aromas of white mineral, kiwi and pear. The mouthfeel is crisp and compact and this easygoing white would drink well with fish, summer foods and salads.",Italy-Piedmont-Cortese
"Slender zippiness supports fresh lemon and white pepper notes on this tight, light-footed and linear white.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"Dry, barrel-influenced and solid on the nose, with tempered aromas of black cherry and berry. The palate is juicy and shows good physical definition, while the flavors of raspberry and plum are good. Straight-ahead and solid on the finish.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Cracked pepper, thyme and cedar feature on the nose, while the blueberry and black-cherry fruit comes out more on the palate, alongside hints of coffee grounds and asphalt. There's ample weight, while the texture is somewhat loose and open-knit, more corduroy than suede.",New Zealand-Hawke's Bay-Syrah
"This is serious and concentrated, probably built to age a few more years before its peak. It smells soaked with black cherry and black currant aromas, tastes deep, ripe and compelling, and feels full bodied and firmly tannic. The flavors are powerful enough to match the big texture, so it should improve through 2020.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Yalumba's western outpost has been steadily improving the quality of its wines, and the 2010 21 Barriques represents its top wine to date.

"Taylors (exported under the Wakefield Estate label) is a top-notch source for Cabernet Sauvignon. The 2004 boasts a big nose of cassis, mint or eucalyptus and a touch of roasted peppers. It's mouthfilling, with plenty of soft tannins, then finishes with more cassis and a hint of coffee.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Even in a flight of top BAs and TBAs, this one stood out. It's hugely sweet and viscous, yet also has amazingly fresh acids that really prolong the finish and promise decades—if not centuries—of cellaring. Golden raisin and dried apricot notes are true to type, and the wine's balance is impeccable.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"This new cuvée takes its name from the fermentation practice of mixing whole berries with grape-cluster stalks—just stalks, not whole clusters. Herbs and pine needle flavors dominate brambly berry fruit. It's quite young and raw, and will benefit from further bottle age.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Duckhorn's new releases are so good, you might hesitate to make the investment on this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend. True, it's not the most drinkable of their wines, at this time, but it easily is the most intense and concentrated. Dazzles with a molten core of sweet blackberries, blueberries and cassis, deep and long in the finish. Don't insult it by drinking before 2013, but you're better served by holding for far longer, even into the 2020s.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Lavish violet perfume introduces this demure yet luminous Pinot Noir.

It's ready to drink now but should continue to drink well until at least 2023.",US-New York-Pinot Noir

"Still very young and austere, this should blossom into a beauty. Aromas of leather, red berry, licorice, menthol and a balsamic note carry through to the vibrant, structured palate along with intense mineral.

The grapes are from Stillwater Creek, delivering ripe, tangy flavors of lime, pineapple, apple, pear and nectarine; all with a firm acid underpinning.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"A lightly pétillant ice wine. Harvested at almost 38 brix, it is not as dense and racy as the ice wines of British Columbia or eastern Canada, but it offers its own pleasures. Here are details of sweet straw, rice cracker, caramel and honey, nicely interwoven and persistent, and never turning cloying or sugary.",US-Washington-White Blend
"The 2006 vintage is a tricky one for Barolo because it favors elegance and power over softness and concentration. This expression from the talented team at Coppo shows the vintage well with this compact, astringent and ethereal expression that needs more time to soften.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"Aromas recall ripe berry and blue flower with a balsamic note. The structured but seemingly weightless palate delivers layers of ripe raspberry, juicy dark cherry, clove and licorice alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. An intense mineral note signals the close. Drink 2017–2027.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"From 53-year-old organic and biodynamically farmed Grenache vines, this elegant wine could easily age for 10 years but is drinkable now. Bursting with red cherries, strawberries, herbs, vanilla and violets, the palate's ultrafine tannins are backed by juicy fruit and a long, herbal, cranberry finish.",Australia-South Australia-Grenache
"Very structured and firm, this has the weight, richness and power that is typical of Echézeaux. It's the tension between the tannins and the ripe black fruits that give this wine its great aging ability and depth of flavor. It needs at least six years.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Marzipan, marshmallow, cotton candy, churned butter and pie crust show on the very buttery but fascinating nose of this bottling, made by a winery that likes lots of bottle age. Broad, hearty, ripe and delicious flavors of butter, meringue and vanilla are leveled by sour yellow apple touches and an intriguing chive and Maui onion element.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is two-thirds Merlot, with a half-dozen other grapes filling in the balance. It's a soft, thick and rich wine that feels and tastes as if it's farther along the aging curve than the vintage would suggest.

"Pretty raspberry fruit scents and flavors dominate, and in the mouth there is a sense of grainy sugars. It has good fruit and ripeness, but still seems a little disjointed. Perhaps more time in the bottle will help sort it out.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Vibrant diesel, orange rind, white flower and dried apricot aromas lead to dry stone fruit flavors in this wine. It shows a pleasant balance and persists through the finish.",US-Washington-Riesling

"Piercing aromas of very ripe fruit, verging on scents of raisins and prunes, mix in with dark streaks of cedar, coffee, and baking chocolate. Nothing shy here! This is full-bodied, forceful, big, bold and still balanced, though not a wine to pair with anything but the most robust foods.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"Intensely floral on the nose, this is a blend of 70% Pinot Grigio grown in Carneros, 15% Traminer also grown in Carneros, and 15% Moscato giallo from Lodi, which the producer has previously employed in delightful wines of its own.

This young wine seems built for the wine cellar. If you plan to drink it sooner, give it an hour in the decanter. Drink 2020–2030.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"For an off vintage, this is a nice wine. It has a touch of leafiness on the nose but also dark fruit, shoe polish and style.

Textured on the finish, and definitely not dilute or choppy like so many others from 2002.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Earthy, herbal, lightly leafy aromas blend with boysenberry and exotic spice notes. This Malbec-led blend is jammy and thick on the palate, with blueberry, oregano and cured-meat flavors. A solid finish holds onto the wine's core fruit and herbal notes.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend

"The cool vintage took its toll on this Pinot Noir. It has off-aromas and flavors that suggest barely-ripened, green strawberries, raw mushrooms and some vegetal notes.",US-California-Pinot Noir

Drink now–2006. —M.M.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo

"Hits all the right notes, from the rich, sweet tropical fruit to the butter and toast accents, but like the third violin in the symphony, lacks that extra flair to really stand out. The oak is well proportioned, and some zesty lime notes that should make it reasonably versatile with food grace the finish. —J.C.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Briny, vegetal aromas of asparagus and jalapeño lead to a viscous palate with blazing coastal acidity. Flavors of lime and tangerine are offset by vegetal bell pepper and asparagus notes, while this feels round, oily and smooth on a finish with good acidic cut.

"A big, chunky tannic wine, loaded with black-cherry fruit. The structure is there to age awhile, and 15 months in 50% new French oak has added notes of coffee and dark chocolate. There's a hint of tar, and overall an impression of bridled power. Drink now through 2025.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This ripe Pinot is as sweetly sappy as raspberry syrup. The oak brings additional sweetness, this time of caramel and buttered toast. A little clumsy now, but might gain traction in the cellar.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This may be the quintessential site among the extensive Milbrandt vineyards that produce much of the K Vintners Syrah lineup. The Northridge bottling has amazing purity and concentration, with a beguiling mix of deep berry fruits and gravelly minerality. Supple power, muscular and dense.",US-Washington-Syrah

Pretty much your standard, textbook, well-made Chardonnay.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"This bold, densely flavored and impressively tannic wine is dry, very well structured and will be interesting to age until 2018–2019. It smells darkly fruity, smoky and spicy, and tastes like cranberry and black cherry, finishing with a firm tang of tannin. It will be best after 2018.",US-California-Red Blend

"Here's a round, savory Nero d'Avola that's loaded with juicy blackberry, tart red cherry and black raspberry sensations. The juicy, easygoing palate is accented by hints of black pepper, clove and roasted almond that give it a pleasantly bitter finish. There's low complexity, but it is delicious.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola

"This informal Rosso shows balance and intensity with bright berry aromas and acidity that is not too sharp. In fact, the wine is nicely rounded and supple.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"A rich, buttery wine, with classic mineral and citrus characters. Very taut and tight, while layering fresh fruit flavors. Crisp and rounded at the same time.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"This is a wine with some tannic structure adding richness and shape to its red fruit character. Ripe cherries and red currants dominate, laced with acidity. It's ready to drink, but could improve over another year.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Michel Redde makes some attractive Sancerres, like this wine, across the river from its base in Pouilly. It is crisp and light as the vintage dictates.

"Sweet and a little foxy on the nose, with secondary aromas of air freshener. The flavors are a touch brambly and herbal, while the palate is flush and chewy but also a little tannic and choppy. Doesn't seem as thought this is as structured and serious as it was, say, four or five years ago.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This is a unique wine that not everyone will like. It definitely has personality and complexity and is completely unlike the commercial passitos flooding the market. Aromas include cola, root beer, caramel, dried mint, chestnut and apricot. There's also a musky side of earth and white mushroom. It is thickly concentrated and syrupy in the mouth. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Zibibbo
"Surh Luchtel knows how to make a great Cab. The '05 is a beautiful wine, softly complex and layered, with black currant, cherry, mocha, sweet oak and spicy flavors. But it's tannins that really mark this wine. They're so fine, so authoritative. Drink now–2010.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

Lightly herbal, leathery flavors of red currant and wild berry finish oaky, with more than adequate filling.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"It's pure Cabernet Sauvignon, dense, dark and what might be called brooding. Despite the massive fruit, the darker notes of black olive and earth are not submerged in sweetness. In fact, there are Stag's Leap-like flavors of rock and mineral. Along with the sleek cassis and black cherry, come highlights of bitter chocolate.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Elegant in construction, with fine acidity and a sleek mouthfeel. What really stars are the flavors.

Should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"As its name suggests this wine comes from vines planted close to the Torto River that runs through the quinta. The extra warmth from the river produces extra-ripe grapes that go into this powerful, although impressively restrained wine. Foot trodden in traditional stone fermenters, the wine is rich with the same opulent texture as a vintage Port (although of course dry). Dark and for the long haul the wine should not be consumed before 2020.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red

"This bold, mouthfilling wine was aged in large-format barrels, helping make it polished and relaxed in texture. Aromas and flavors are ripe and inviting, like blackberries and black cherries, while the mouthfeel is well supported by fine-grained tannins.",US-California-Tempranillo
"Bright and fruity, this Chardonnay has citrus and peach flavors, with notes of almond, vanilla and spice that reflect the wood aging and make this a wine that's crisp and rich. It has a strong texture, and it needs 4–5 years for its complexities to fully evolve.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"Cool, herbal black-fruit aromas come with olive and eucalyptus notes. The palate is full but grating, while flavors of herbal berry and plum are bit salty. On the finish, olive, brine and herbal berry flavors set this apart from most Ribera del Dueros. Drink through 2021.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinto Fino
"Pretty standard Chardonnay, with a creamy texture and oaky tropical fruit flavors. Not bad for the price, if you're in a Chard mood.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Lots of licorice and vanilla, coffee and dark chocolate notes are found, reflecting its 22 months spent in French oak. The fruit is definitely consigned to the back row, but there's plenty of luscious, chocolatey flavor.",US-Washington-Syrah
"A picture-perfect Zinfandel from this famous vineyard. It's dry and soft in tannins and acids, and while it's a little high and sweet in alcohol, it's not too much. The raspberry, cherry, tobacco and bacon flavors finish in a swirl of peppery spices.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Sourced from Les Collines Vineyard in Walla Walla and Wallula Benches Vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills, this engaging Syrah features firm, ripe fruit, brown spice and a strong streak of cola.

"A tough, gritty wine not offering much richness. It's very dry and quite acidic, and the modest cherry flavors veer into tobacco, white pepper and sage.",US-California-Sangiovese
"This is a softly gentle wine, with a drop of Sémillon contributing an oily, cashew earthiness to Sauvignon's citrus and tropical fruit flavors.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"The 200-acre Shea vineyard provides fruit to many of Oregon's best winemakers. Here is the estate's own brand, offering up a fragrant, appealing blend from various blocks. Floral highlights, dusty spices, a whiff of cocoa and a streak of nut butter all come into focus around pretty purple fruits. The finish is silky, long and lovely.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

The length just gets you.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon perfectly captures the vineyard's strengths: lush, ripe, fleshy fruit that shows perfectly ripened flavors of cherry and cassis, bolstered by ripe, chewy tannins. It's substantial but not tiring; the balance of fruit, acid and tannins holds it together through a spicy, lingering finish. It's just a delicious wine, and one that should cellar well also.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Malbec is a bit shy on the nose, with aromas of charred black plum, lava rock and soy sauce. Dried black-cherry and charred-oak flavors show on the sip along with thyme, oregano and marjoram. The tannins are still quite firm.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Amazingly rich and voluptuous, this shows none of the rustic edges that can sometimes plague Malbec. It's concentrated in blackberry jam and black currant flavors, with a jacket of smoky oak. The alcohol is high, but not overbearing. This really asserts itself with the customary power and authority of a great Mount Veeder red. Wonderful now, but should continue to develop for at least 10–15 years.",US-California-Malbec
"This wood-aged wine is spicy and toasty. It comes from a small property 1,000 feet above the Douro. Although it offers blackberry flavors and acidity, these are dominated by the wood. Let the wine soften a few months more and drink from 2018.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"The brothers are better known for their Cornas, but this Saint-Joseph is a nice wine as well.

"Bitter cherry fruits and firmer tannins dominate this serious, concentrated Pinot Noir. It has weight and a youthful bitterness that needs time to round out. The juiciness and the structure are both there for aging.",Austria-Thermenregion-Pinot Noir
"There is a definite richness to this wine, the ripe white fruit and melon flavors aided by a judicious amount of vanilla and toast. That makes the wine seductive, but Laroche does not forget its Chablis origins and leaves enough room for a core of grapefruit, steel and tight acidity. Screwcap.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

Drink now for the sheer pleasure of its freshness.",South Africa-Western Cape-Chardonnay
"Very rich, ripe and complex, showing a near-perfect display of flavors and textures. The riper blackberries and black cherries have a chewy, meaty edge, with notes of cola and bacon. Very fine tannins and acidity suggest midterm to longterm aging, but it's a splendid sipper now. Should develop through 2018, at least.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Mandarin peel flirts with the aromatic zest of Seville orange. The concentration of flavor is immense and has the verve, drive and linearity of a jet-engine on on takeoff. The palate slows down the motion and captures the nuanced flavors of Seville orange—tinged green, bitter, juicy and tart at the same time.

"A little too sweet, with a candied taste of sugared cherries, blackberries and cola, and a dash of caramel. Other than that the tannins are very fine.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This bright and spicy wine is packed with botanical flavors. The aromatics are pungent and intense, pushing sharp notes of lime, Meyer lemon and orange soda deep into the palate. In some ways this has the penetrating density of Gewürztraminer. It's bold and distinctive, though clearly different from other domestic Viogniers.",US-Oregon-Viognier
"The nose of this wine is full of violet, sweet cherry, strawberry jam and fig. The palate is reminiscent of a fresh strawberry covered in balsamic reduction and the satin-smooth tannins carry this along to the long finish.",US-Virginia-Red Blend
"Soft and so easy to drink, this is a fresh and fruity wine with gentle red fruits and light acidity. Attractive, it's crisply ready to enjoy.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Very dark and seemingly on the cooked side of the ledger. The nose is black and raisiny, while the core flavors are saucy. At least this meaty, overdone Garnacha isn't oaked, so in that sense it isn't offensive. But it is definitely soft, and without much future.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"Ripe and ready, with powerful dark fruit. This is a fine “starter” Cab from Chile and Concha y Toro, one that will impress novices and satisfy the high-end drinker as well. The palate is slightly sugary, but the black fruit is ripe and tasty. And the tannins are there, as they should be, although they're not overwhelming. Best Buy.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Rich while also structured, it has a mineral texture that gives fine acidity and a tight feel, all balanced by ripe apricot fruits. The wine should round out by 2015 to give a ripe, full-bodied feel.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This bottling shows fresh blueberry and blackberry aromas as well as a bright purple-flower touch reminiscent of wisteria. Bright and juicy on the palate, it features hedonistic touches of strawberry and olallieberry lifted by clove dust.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Perfumed and silky, this wine is meaty in ripeness and texture, with the flavors somewhat askew and leaning tart and tangy.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Light apple aromas lead to a sweet, mildly candied palate of monotone apple flavors. Acidity is up there, so there isn't any overt thickness or chunkiness to the wine. Rudimentary and quaffable.",Chile-Central Valley-Chardonnay
"Richness and elegance go toe-to-toe in this creamy yet crisp, fruity Chardonnay. It's lavishly textured, enriched by streaks of butter and cream, yet pristine apple and pear flavors shine through brightly. The caramel-kissed finish lingers.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Stiff tannins are matched to sharp raspberry and boysenberry fruit, crafting a well-defined, young and potent wine. This may benefit from another year or two in bottle, but it's already a tasty, albeit tight wine with a mix of fresh fruit and astringent, herb and cracker flavors.",US-Oregon-Cabernet Franc
"Aromas of ripe black fruit, tilled earth and grilled herb unfold in the glass. The straightforward, already accessible palate delivers sour cherry, licorice and white pepper accompanied by rather firm tannins. Drink through 2018.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Aromas of tobacco, molasses and damp moss suggest earthiness, yet the palate is piercing and high-wire, with bright, almost blinding acidity pushing cherry and red plum flavors. Kind of gritty on the finish, where the tannins and acids combine.",Chile-Maule Valley-Red Blend
"Monte Lodoletta Amarone is an exercise in extraction. The wine is absolutely black. Aromas are concentrated and intense and the wine is equally enormous in the mouth thanks to the extraction, oak, fruit and the hot climatic conditions associated with this vintage. Drink after 2020.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Good winemaking lies at the heart of this wine, which also blends in smidgens of Cab Franc, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Malbec, the grapes from a range of estate-grown sites. Balanced fruit and dusty tannins accent a generously expansive palate that is rich but not overly concentrated, shining in berry, cherry and mocha tones.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Opening with an alluring fragrance of acacia flower, Spanish broom and beeswax, this boasts fleshy peach and juicy pineapple flavors, along with mineral notes and a drop of honey. It has lovely depth and should evolve more complexity over the next 2–3 years.",Italy-Central Italy-Verdicchio
"A big step down from the past two vintages. This Verdejo lacks fortitude and clarity; it's grassy and flat on the nose, then cloying on the palate. Flavors of bland citrus are disjointed and underwhelming. Finishes grassy and green.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"Aromas of leather, blue flower, berry, aromatic herb and a whiff of game come together in the glass. The racy palate doles out crushed raspberry, sour cherry, anise and mineral. Firm, refined tannins and vibrant acidity provide support.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This taut, dry Grenache shows better structure than most California Grenaches, with its firm texture and bite of acidity. It shows the variety's cherry flavors. Tasty now, it's a good substitute for any medium-bodied wine, such as Zinfandel or Merlot.",US-California-Grenache
"Here's a simple, easy sparkling wine with some sweet flavors of peach and apricot backed by drying mineral tones and chopped garden herbs. The quality of the perlage is foamy and soft.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"A typical Gers blend of Colombard, Sauvignon Blanc and Gros Manseng from South West France, this is a spicy, fruity and elegantly light wine. It is fresh, crisp with grapefruit and pear juice flavors and ready to drink.",France-France Other-White Blend
"The Dead Arm rarely wows this reviewer in our blind tastings, and while the 2007 is undeniably a very good wine, it shows a tart edge and a reined-in personality. Toast and vanilla frame cranberry and raspberry fruit, chocolate overtones and savory, meaty elements. Try it after 2015 and see if it has loosened up at all.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz

"Smells like spiced applesauce. The palate is more full than light, with roundness but lemony, tart flavors of citrus and green apple. Tart again on the finish, with an odd oily feel. Seems green as well.",Chile-Central Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Leather, smoked meat, crushed rock, stewed black cherry and dried oregano notes show on the rustic nose of this bottling from the team at Cru Wine Company. It's light bodied, making for easy quaffing, with red plum, beef jerky and baking spice flavors.",US-California-Tempranillo
"The nose presents a mélange of pear, yeast and peppery herbs. On the palate, the fruit is almost completely subdued and dominated by strident yeastiness. This unusual wine would work well with soft, washed-rind cheeses or miso-flavored dishes.",Austria-Burgenland-Grüner Veltliner
"Sourced entirely from the estate vineyard, this is two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one-third Merlot, with just a splash of Petit Verdot. Fat, juicy, toasty and deliciously flavorful, it opens quickly into a plush midpalate, with pomegranate and raspberry fruit dominant. Streaks of caramel and nougat thread through the generous finish. Enjoy right now.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

It's made from 50% Mourvèdre, 40% Grenache and 10% Petite Sirah.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Crisp, tight acidity and still-young, fresh fruitiness give this wine its initial brightness. Rich and full in the mouth, it also has a range of complex fruit flavors followed by hints of toastiness that will only continue to develop. It should be aged further, so drink from 2016.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"A blend of Chardonnay, Garganega and Sauvignon, this has aromas of peach and golden apple. The simple palate offers pineapple and banana alongside bright acidity. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Veneto-White Blend
"Clouds of aromatic flower play along with zesty orange flavors. Grapefruit provides spice and drive. The palate shows that counterpoint of ripeness and tartness that makes this so very moreish. This is juicy and powerful, yet precise and toned despite all its generosity. This is a light, tightrope walk between two thrilling worlds. It's full of life and joy with an endless finish.",Austria-Kamptal-Riesling
"An earthy aroma comes from this vivid dark red wine. It is gently soft, not quite dry and with black-plum fruits. The aftertaste is soft, very fruity and ready to drink.",France-Southwest France-Malbec

"Dashe always produces dependably good Zinfandels from this vineyard. The 2009 shows real complexity, with an earthy, mushroomy richness alongside the raspberry, red currant and spice flavors. It's very dry, with a fine structure of acid and tannins. Marked by the rusticity that characterizes Dry Creek Zinfandels. It calls for pairing with rich stews, braised meats and barbecue.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Vernaccia takes a subdued approach and delivers clean aromas of grapefruit, pear and honey that are distinctive yet not very intense. It's very lean and compact in the mouth but ends with clean acidity.",Italy-Tuscany-Vernaccia

"Cidery aromas are briny. This feels low on bubbles but propped up by citric acidity. Orange and lettuce flavors end in pedestrian fashion, with a note of green herbs. This Cava's moderate, straightforward personality is due to the fact that it's 100% Xarello.",Spain-Catalonia-Xarel-lo

"Planted in 1999 specifically for the producer, this vineyard block provides power and structure, revealing shocks of blackberry jam, mocha and gunpowder amidst a streak of wild anise and black pepper. Robust and bold, it begs for another 10 to 15 years in the cellar before finding its complete composure.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This wine doesn't try to conceal what it is, a 100% varietal exploration of a hearty grape, though in this case, from a relatively cool area. Black-purple in color, it offers structure and tension atop developed flavors of mocha chocolate and plum.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Hard and tannic, this doesn't show much in the way of varietal character. There's a hint of red fruit, some tar and rubber, and a thin, somewhat stemmy finish.",US-Washington-Sangiovese
"Lots of briary wild blackberry, cherry and exotic spice flavors in this Zin, with cola, tobacco and mushu plum sauce complexities, and the finish is dry. Compromised by a hit of sharp acidity, but rich barbecue will help.",US-California-Zinfandel

"Aromas of flaky piecrust, spiced apple and macadamia nut are vivid and alluring. Medium to full in body, this proves to have both flesh and spine.",US-Virginia-Viognier
"A good, dry Chardonnay that gets the job done at a fair price. Shows peaches and cream flavors with a bit of sharpness and green herbs on the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Aromas of ripe black plum, cooking spice and scorched earth lead the nose. The robust, bulky palate offers prune, dried cherry, vanilla and a hint of white pepper set against bracing tannins while the heat of scorching alcohol throws it off balance. Drink soon to catch the remaining fruit.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This wine starts out quite reductive, while also showing aromas of black olive, herbs and chocolate. It's full bodied in feel with abundant dark fruit flavors that show persistence. There are good things here but the aromas and flavors seem disconnected.",US-Washington-Syrah

Feels round and voluminous, with minty, rubbery flavors of oaky, berry and chocolate. Finishes dry and oaky, with a buttery aftertaste.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Bonarda
This single-vineyard wine has great aging potential. The minerality and tension in this wine with its apple fruit and texture is still resolving itself. Wait at least until 2019 before drinking.,France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"Ripe, soft wine, deliciously rounded with fresh white and green fruits combining into a creamy herbaceousness. There is a final tang to this concentrated, full wine. Screwcap.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"A flinty nose of citrus purity hints that this still requires bottle age, but all the elements of a great wine are present. It offers a bundled concentration of flavor and fruit, and a straight backbone of acidity pervades everything with a sense of purity. Right now, fresh citrus notes of lemon pith, peel and flesh dominate aromatically, but this will blossom. There are already inklings of honey and orange in the background but only time will reveal what cabinet of wonders is hidden here. Drink 2017–2025.",France-Alsace-Riesling

"The best bottle in a strong 2010 William Church lineup, this pure, single-vineyard Malbec is flat-out lovely. Deep purple fruits—plums and cherries—meet silky tannins and just the right touch of French oak, a mix of new, once used and neutral. Young, compact and dense, it should reward up to a decade of cellaring.",US-Washington-Malbec
"Smooth, fruity and fairly deep for a basic Merlot. The palate is medium-to-full in terms of weight and bite, with ripe berry fruit and light oak notes leading to a long, chocolaty finish. Textbook everyday Chilean Merlot, which means it's pleasant and easy to drink.",Chile-Rapel Valley-Merlot

"Red plum compote is at the center of this wine, a 100% varietal, with hearty bursts of herb and green pepper, as well as savory spice. From the cooler Coombsville appellation, it is soft, round and on the paler, thinner side of Napa's ripeness spectrum, more restrained.",US-California-Merlot

"A big, ripe, opulent and oaky Pinot Noir, forward in fruit and needing a little time to knit together.

Absolutely delicious now, with a good decant, and should develop additional bottle complexities over the next 6–8 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir

Definitely lively and forward, but also rough and slightly drying and bitter on the finish.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"The top drop from Bethel Heights in this vintage, this is a dark, dense evocation of Pinot Noir at its most authoritative and engaging. It's a muscular mix of mulberry, blueberry and blue plum, with a dash of sassafras for good measure. The length and sense of throttled power suggest that this is a fine cellar candidate. Drink now through 2028.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"The wine is off dry, fruity and refreshing. It has lively citrus acidity as well as sliced apple crispness. The wine has the lightest prickle on the tongue, leaving a bright aftertaste. Drink now.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White

"Sharp aromas of peach blossoms, honeyed nuts and lemon balm make for a fruity yet biting nose on this blend of 58% Grenache Blanc from Happy Canyon and 42% Viognier from San Luis Obispo County.

"This blend of Petit Verdot (28%), Malbec (27%), Syrah (20%), Cabernet Sauvignon (16%) and Merlot (9%) leads with wild blueberry, crushed flower, herb, vanilla and spice aromas. Soft, elegant blueberry flavors follow, persisting on the finish. Light on the midpalate, it still brings appeal.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Fiery at first, this also has mint and toast notes to the otherwise black-fruit-scented nose. It feels tannic and drawing, but strong boned. Flavors of roasted black fruit are bolstered by olive, chocolate and spicy toast accents. Finishes savory and firm.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made with 60% Pinot Bianco, 30% Chardonnay and 10% Sauvignon Blanc, this boasts appealing aromas of acacia flower, nectarine and Alpine herb. The elegant palate delivers juicy Gala apple, yellow peach and a touch of ginger alongside fresh acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend

"Typically soft and ripe, this is already a delicious, fruity wine. It is strongly perfumed and has the acidity typical of the vintage. Ripe red fruits and acidity are well balanced, with dry tannins that are still in the background. Drink the wine from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"A tough, gritty wine, dry and tannic, with some decent berry and cherry flavors. It's the kind of red wine that will happily wash down a cheeseburger.",US-California-Red Blend
"Woody, toasty aromas announce this rich wine. With the ripe peach and nectarine flavors, this feels generous and opulent. However, there is always that push of a more steely, taut character to keep  firmly in its terroir.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"An edgy, perfumed wine, textured and steely, with white fruit flavors cutting through the acidity and the taut apple skin core. It is a beautiful wine that also has a complex core of flavors. Age for 3–4 years or more.",Austria-Kremstal-Riesling
"Still young, this is a structured wine with the dark botrytis flavors giving as much richness as sweetness at this stage. Yellow fruits are integrated into a tight, mineral texture that will open up over the next few months. Drink from 2019.",France-Southwest France-Gros and Petit Manseng
"A grapey wine, thin and watery, with just a hint of raspberry soda pop and coffee grounds.",US-Oregon-Grenache

"Luminous peach and tangerine flavors take center stage in this gorgeously composed sweet Riesling. Lip-smacking honey and candied orange peel flavors are offset by a dazzling streak of citrusy acidity. Despite all the sweetness, the finish is pristinely mineral. It's stunning already but should only improve through 2050.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Rounded and rich wine, its acidity pushing through firm tannins and lively red fruits. There are both freshness and structure here, with final juiciness.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Dull and thin, with watered-down peach and citrus flavors. No much going on in this Sauvignon Blanc.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

"The wine feels overworked, with oak used to make it richer. The result is dry, tart and thin, except for all that buttered toast.",US-California-Chardonnay

"This is a lively and fascinating Sauvignon Blanc for those who love the herbal side of the grape. Dill, basil and bell pepper aromas garnish its baseline of graphite minerality. The palate also rides the pyrazine edge, showing cut grass, lime peel, jalapeño and wet stone flavors.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
This smells and tastes like cherry Powerade—soft and merely fruity. Not for aging.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Bone dry, ultra-crisp in acidity, and lean in mineral flavors, this barrel-fermented, lees-aged Roussanne is the opposite of rich. But it's enormously elegant, and its leanness contains subtle hints of Meyer lemons, grapefruits, toast, yeast and cold, hard steel. A sommelier's dream for pairing with very complex dishes.",US-California-Roussanne
"This is a light, graceful red that's stemmy and fresh in a mix of well-integrated cranberry, rhubarb and cardamom flavors. An undercurrent of earthy truffle plays on the palate, weaving its way to a long finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Aromas of raw oak, eucalyptus and gritty berry fruits are hot and leafy. This Tempranillo-based blend feels choppy with aggressive grating tannins.

"Dry and acidic, this Chardonnay has a herbaceous earthiness, plus flavors of orange and pear.",US-California-Chardonnay
"From a newish, small producer that's worth keeping an eye on, this wine is earthy and slightly cloudy, balanced in nature. Wild strawberry and cranberry are pitted smoothly against firm, medium-bodied tannins and oak. The finish is crisp and juicy.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This single-vineyard Malbec blend from vineyards that sit at 6,500 feet smells dark, grilled and rubbery, but also meaty and full of fruit. A full, lush palate avoids fierceness and lays on the richness. Toasty, lightly herbal berry and plum flavors are highly appealing. The wine tastes of herbs, salted meat and spices on a complex finish. Drink through 2024.",Argentina-Other-Red Blend
"Mustard-seed aromas pierce the nose, which otherwise is mostly apple and pineapple. Lemon, green apple and passion fruit flavors are accented by the lightest touch of oregano and basil. For a cru, it's rather simple, with extremely light fruit on the finish and very little length or substance to the back end.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Here's an intriguing wine with many interesting contrasts: It offers mineral dryness on the nose and sweet fruit in the mouth; and a lean tonic feel against opulent texture. This organic sparkler has a fine, chiseled quality and a pretty ensemble of flavors.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"Dry, oaky and minerally, this Chardonnay shows intensely focused Meyer lemon, lime, Asian pear and golden apricot flavors, whose acidity makes it savory. One-third new oak gives it a vanilla and buttered toast richness. Drink this fine wine now, but not too cold.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Aromas of matchstick, herb, vanilla and cinnamon are followed by a creamy-feeling palate that equally mixes fruit and barrel flavors. The tannins seem a bit bunched up.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of pear, yellow apples and pineapple carry over to the palate along with a banana note. The juicy palate is balanced by bright acidity, making this perfect for everyday fare from lightly seasoned fish to pasta topped with tomato sauce.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend

"It's quite rare to find a wine in Washington where Counoise (48%) takes the lead, as on this blend that also includes Syrah and Mourvèdre. It brings notes of sagebrush and other herbs, seeming to show some oxygen exposure that overshadows the silky, generous feel.",US-Washington-Red Blend
A vibrant yellow-gold color and a good blend of delicate citrus and butter in the aroma and flavor give this understated and medium-bodied wine the balance and interest to satisfy.,US-California-Chardonnay
"A touch of peach colors the white and green fruit notes of this zippy white, its freshness amplified by a slight spritz. It's light bodied, dry and very refreshing, with a lovely herbal edge on the palate.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"An oaky, earthy aroma and lots of deep, jammy fruit flavors define this full-bodied but very smooth Zinfandel and Barbera blend. While fairly big in impact, the tannins are not very prominent so the mouthfeel and finish are gentle.",US-California-Red Blend
"Here's an earthy, savory expression of Barolo from the prized La Serra cru that truly shows Nebbiolo typicity. You'll recognize aromas of iron and mineral backed by cola, white mushroom, tar and cassis fruit. That earthy personality is followed by drying, dusty tannins and the wine is exceptionally long on the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Good citrus fruit flavors, along the lines of grapefruits, limes and Meyer lemons, accompanied by zesty acidity mark this bone-dry Sauvignon Blanc. It really scours the mouth clean. Very nice with puff pastry mushroom appetizers, bruschetta with goat cheese and roasted red peppers, or crudités with a garlicky sour cream dip.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

"Aromas that recall nail varnish eventually fade to reveal raisin, prune, chocolate and coffee notes that carry over to the palate along with plum, toasted oak and vanilla.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
Ripe orange and plump stone fruits rise from the glass while subtle rose scents hover. The palate is fresh. There is enough acidity and a slightly bitter phenolic edge to frame the peach and orange fruit that is augmented by a little residual sweetness. The finish is off dry. Drink while flavors are fresh.,France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"The aroma of this wine shows strong signs of the wood aging, although red fruits do show as well. There is a minty character from the new wood, berry fruit flavors and the juicy acidity of the vintage. The wine is going to age well over the medium term, so drink from 2015.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A spray of rose petals perfumes this aromatic spätlese. Its freshness is exhilarating, contrasting lavish layers of honey and marmalade against the sharp bites of pineapple, tangerine and lemon. Cutting and spry, yet deeply penetrating, it finishes on a lingering pollen note.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"This wine has weight and the potential for ripe black fruits. At this stage, it is closed up, full of suggestions without realization. Wait until 2017 for the rich character to be fully revealed.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Like most barrel-fermented Viuras from Rioja, this smells oaky but low on fruit. Round and resiny on the palate, this tastes mostly of saucy oak and briny citrus. The finish is sound in feel but challenging in flavor.",Spain-Northern Spain-Viura
"Plum, prune, oak and vanilla aromas combine to form a welcoming, solid bouquet. This feels snappy, fresh and firm, with no weaknesses. Toasty, earthy plum and cherry flavors finish lively, zesty and spicy, with mild tartness. Drink through 2018.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"This opens with pretty aromas of orchard fruit and a tinge of spring blossom. The juicy palate delivers tropical fruit, white peach and citrus alongside bright acidity. A light mineral note marks the close.",Italy-Lombardy-Turbiana

"A steady protagonist in the greater Brunello family, PianCornello delivers a masculine and powerful wine with aromas of dark fruit, leather, tobacco and rum cake. It shows medium density and thickness in the mouth, with bright cherry flavors shining through on the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Solid and varietally correct, this brings citrus and melon fruit flavors in modest proportion to a simple, but balanced midpalate. It carries a hint of sugar in the finish.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc

"The 2005 vintage was kind to this wine, grown in the warmer, northerly Middle Reach section of the valley. While lacking the depth of the 2002 and 2003, it shows flavorful black currants, cherries and root beer, with a peppery finish. The tannins are rich and fine. Small additions of Zin, Malbec, Petite Sirah and other red varieties add complexity.",US-California-Syrah
"An impression of this light-bodied wine starts with a vivid golden-yellow color and enticing aromas of fresh bread dough and marzipan. The taste itself is more lean than the aromas, showing crisp lemon and apricot notes, noticeable acidity and a tart finish. It has a taut, dry character that is not typical in California, but the wine is fascinating and keeps improving for a day or two after opening.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Rich while also structured, this is beginning to be delicious. Acidity comes from the black currant fruits while the structure shows dense tannins and wood-aging flavors. The wine is still young and prepared for a long haul, so don't drink before 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Another excellent vintage from Saffron Fields, under the guiding hand of veteran winemaker Tony Rynders. Buoyed by aging in 50% new French oak, it's got more flesh than most Pinots from this cool vintage, along with generous amounts of sweet spices and barrel toast. The red fruits and complementary acidity are also here in abundance.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"In the old times, a Douro vineyard held a muddle of any number of different local grapes. This wine, from 80-year-old vines, is a tribute to the old style of vineyard planting. It's firm, very concentrated and dark, with stunning tannins and rich fruit. The black plum-skin texture, superripe fruit, chocolate and final acidity are all developing slowly and impressively. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Insanely rich, this explodes in the mouth with orange, pineapple, apricot, tropical fruit and sweet new-oak flavors. The richness is tempered with crisp acidity and a minerality that tastes like a lick of cold steel. This is a good price for a Santa Lucia Chardonnay this rich and appealing.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Barely ripe, with a pungent, ammonia edge to the citrus fruits. It's very dry and crisp in acidity.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"A good followup to the 2004, Ottimino's 2005 is exuberantly rich and forward in jammy wild blackberry and cherry flavors, with an array of spicy pepper, clove and anise. Entirely dry, it's wrapped into ripe, firm tannins. Now through 2010.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Medium in build and concentration, this perfumed Roero exhibits tones of pressed violets, tealeaf, forest fruit and wet earth. Pair this wine with buttery or cheesy foods that will benefits from the naturally high tannins and acidity.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"87-89 Barrel sample. With its lovely fresh fruit, gentle tannins, spice and acidity, this is an easy, open, gentle wine. The fruit is ripe and floral.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wonderful under-$20 Malbec opens with a blast of black-fruit aromas as well as mild rubber scents and minerality. The palate is solid, with baked berry and integrated saline and mineral flavors. A bright, lively finish with a ton of berry essence closes this out.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"The old-vines Linda vineyard Malbec is a particular wine, one that shows a high herbal, almost weedy nose that's heavy with tomato leaf. This is choppy and bumpy on the palate. Spicy red-berry and tomato flavors finish with pulling tannins and a lasting herbal character.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Give this 100% Cabernet just a little more time in the cellar. Even at six-plus years of age, its tannins are hard, although the primary blackberry fruit flavors are beginning to dry out and become earthy. It should approach its peak around 2015.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Intense, well-directed aromas are staunch, woody and suggest turpentine before pulling back. A lemony palate is loaded with citric acidity, which creates an electric mouthfeel. Nutty, citric and zesty on the finish, this is a superb artisan fino with a high level of complexity.",Spain-Andalucia-Sherry
"A very dark color and intensely ripe aromas precede flavors of black cherry, blackberry jam and brown sugar in this full-bodied and thickly textured wine. It's impressive for the level of concentration and sense of saturation.",US-California-Primitivo
"Although it is labeled as Extra Brut, the ripeness of the fruit keeps this wine from being too shockingly dry. Instead, the pure green and ripe apple fruits are allowed to shine in a textured character that is crisp and fresh at the end.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Good red wine in a light, herbaceous style. Tastes fresh and clean as if it was made with good quality standards. Lacks much Cabernet character, however, but adds sufficient cherry and berry flavors to make it complete.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Grown on flinty soil, this strongly mineral-driven wine is structured, tense with acidity and white stone-fruit flavors. The initial crispness opens out into a concentrated, textured wine that will need to age further. Drink from late 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
There's a modern touch to this wine thanks to its generous and long-lasting tones of espresso bean and chocolate backed by fruity cherry aromas. Beyond those standard characteristics are tones of dried herbs that recall coastal Tuscany. It's huge in structure but should also be ready to drink in two or three years.,Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Dark berry, resin, brown baking spice and menthol aromas lead the way. The firm tightly knit palate offers black cherry, licorice, sage and espresso alongside assertive grainy tannins and nervous acidity. Drink 2018–2023.",Italy-Lombardy-Nebbiolo
"This is structured and firm, with its dry tannins prominent along with blackberry and black cherry acidity. The wine does have density, a dusty texture and the chance to further age.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is indeed a very enjoyable Chianti Classico that shows bright fruit nuances of cherry and blackberry followed by spice, leather and dried tobacco. In the mouth, the wine is smooth, medium in intensity but also bright and fresh.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"An opaque color is appropriate for this fully extracted Tannat. Aromas of blackberry, sandalwood and exotic spices are a strong point, while the palate is primed with grating acidity. Full blackberry, cassis and herbal flavors finish cool and toasty but long due to the wine's full-force acidity.",Uruguay-Canelones-Tannat
"Feels a bit too soft for balance and aging, but otherwise a charming wine. Dry and silky, it offers complex flavors of cola, black raspberries, figs, cinnamon and sandalwood, with a long, spicy finish. Now–2012.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Made in an old-fashioned way, this is the kind of wine the immigrants probably drank. It's soft, fruity-raisiny and simple, with enough tannins and acids to combat tomato sauce and garlic.",US-California-Barbera
"Clean, fruity and a touch candied on the bouquet. The palate is narrow but saved by ripe black cherry flavors and spice notes. Finishes with a mocha-like flavor and a crisp, clean feel. A basic but more than satisfactory Malbec. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA Inc.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"There's plenty to like in this bright and spicy, all-Willamette Valley wine. Cherry fruit is lifted with highlights of hot pepper candy. A slightly smoky, slightly burnt character marks the finishing tannins.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This spunky Garnacha smells like fruit punch with some green herbs mixed in. The palate is wiry and acidic in feel, with raspberry and plum flavors. It finishes fresh and zesty.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"Made from equal thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, varieties the are co-fermented and then aged in French oak for 22 months, 60% of the oak new, this is a dusty, leathery and earthy wine. Lightly styled, it shares a deep expression of blackberry, dark chocolate and coffee.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This rich and voluptuous wine wins one over with its baked pear and vanilla sumptuousness, etched with an apple blossom aroma. Robust and velvety on the palate, it's balanced by fresh citrus and wet stone nuances. The lifted acidity provokes both succulence and complexity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Great acidity on this wine, with a squirt of lime juice giving it needed zest. The wine itself is simple, lush and fruity, with peach and pineapple flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Pungent, zesty and quite varietal in its expression. The nose is racy and intense, with nettle, sweat and passion fruit aromas. Expect a wet, almost spritzy palate with green-edged fruit flavors and light herbaceousness. There's bite and sass to this one, and the finish is quite long.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This vintage of the Reiver seems mintier than others, and at times the mint seemed a dominant feature of this wine, which otherwise offers jammy berry fruit and chocolate aromas and flavors. At 15% abv, it's not a shy wine, but neither is it as richly textured as might be expected. Drink it 2013–2020.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Dusty, briny citrus and apple aromas lead to a palate that's calm and only mildly bubbly and active. Lightly pickled lime and tangerine flavors finish dry, slightly bitter and briny, with a coarse but crisp feel of seltzer.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"This shows petrol, honey and brie cheese rind notes on the nose, and is quite creamy once sipped, yet the edges are punctuated with orange peel bitterness. The tartness ensures cellaring potential, so drink 2018–2025.",US-California-Riesling
"Sourced from vines planted 45 years ago, this ripe and floral wine offers classically varietal scents of flowers, while flavors recall pear and peach. The length and detail are excellent.",US-Washington-Chenin Blanc
"This blend of 70% Syrah, 25% Grenache and 5% Mourvèdre is a beautiful shade of purple in the glass, and offers aromas of black plum and milk chocolate. The mouthfeel is silky, with zesty acidity that rises through blueberry and boysenberry flavors toward the caramel-layered finish.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Bright, fresh raspberry fruit takes the center stage in this young and still rather tight wine that will reward further cellaring. There's a hint of metal in the acids. Drink 2020–2030.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This wine impresses from first sip. The addition of 20% Viognier adds violet and lilac hints to the nose. Meat and lavender notes highlight its dense midpalate, packed with flavor and gravelly texture, blanketed with tannin and seasoned with white pepper and clove.",US-California-Syrah
"Zinfandel is joined by Mourvèdre and a few other minor grape varieties in this overtly sweet, high alcohol wine. It's soft and glyceriney, with cherry, blueberry, dark chocolate and pepper flavors. You have to give it credit for being true to its style.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A chocolaty frame wraps around the tightly wound cherry-fruit core. There are delicious seams of coffee, vanilla and caramel, along with notes of tea and tobacco. It's fully accessible and intriguingly complex.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"With lemon, orange, apricot and green melon flavors, this is a fruity wine, with tart notes of green gooseberries that make it savory. There's a lot of honey on the finish that makes you wonder if it's truly dry or flirting with off-dry.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"While impressive now for its weight and flavor profile, this should evolve well, thanks to its heavy tannins and ample concentration. Right now, there is wet earth and prominent mint on the nose. The palate also picks up spearmint, with sagebrush, licorice and tobacco as well. The tannins emerge at the end of the sip, and will continue to smooth out beyond 2020.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"An emphasis on yellow fruit, pear and measured banana almost makes you think Bisol employs a different yeast selection on their Cartizze Cru. The wine is thick and creamy, with excellent opulence and just the right measure of sweetness.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"Coming from one of the region's more picturesque vineyards, this bottling, which is enhanced with 19% Picpoul Blanc, 2% Roussanne and 2% Viognier, leans a tad tropical on the nose, with orange peel cutting into banana, apple custard and tuberose. There's sizzling acidity throughout the palate, with flavors of lemon curd, apple peel and grapefruit pith.",US-California-Grenache Blanc
"Frank Cornelissen is one of the rising stars of Italy's natural wine movement. Munjebel 7 (he does editions, instead of vintages) shows a bright ruby appearance with suspended particles that give it a slightly cloudy appearance. The aromas are fine, delicate and complex with wild berry, crushed granite and dusty earth. His wines are aged in large clay amphorae.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nerello Mascalese
"This is big, ripe and fruity, with noticeable black- and red-cherry notes. It has balanced tannins and, though relatively dry in character, is likely to develop quickly.",Portugal-Port-Port

The flavors broaden out and penetrate, finishing with highlights of cedar, cinnamon and dark chocolate. Drink now through the 2020s, but decant if you want the full expression.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of violet, black-skinned berry and a touch of fresh mint lead the nose on this juicy red. The savory palate delivers ripe blackberry, nutmeg and licorice while fresh acidity and silky tannins provide balance. Enjoy through 2022.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"This high-production Pinot shows good varietal flavors of red cherry candy, cola and spices. It feels common, with a simple finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"“Nu” seems to be Kunde's way of letting us know that this is an unoaked Chardonnay. It shows pure, untrammelled Chard flavors of green apples, peaches, pears, kiwis and limes. It's also a very crisp wine, as it did not undergo the malolactic fermentation.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This enormously rich, extracted Pinot Noir will please flavor-forward fans. It's explosive in raspberries, cherries, cola, figs, bacon, orange zest and other umami tastes, wrapped into a silky texture and brightened with crisp acidity.

"This young Chianti Classico is still a bit closed, but it reveals cherry and raspberry sensations along with black- and white-pepper notes. It's still tightly knit but it should should open up well after one or two more years bottle aging.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Known for its pink-metallic bottle cover and signature “Ace of Spades” logo, this fresh-faced wine is crisp and zesty.

"While there are plenty of firm tannins and weight here, the wine does feel somewhat hollow. The red fruits are there, showing slowly against the tannins. It has fine final acidity, but not the power and concentration you should expect.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Big, rich, almost velvet in texture, this is a powerful wine. It has spice, black berry fruits, layers of wood and black plum skins. Powerful wine for long-term aging and medium-term accessibility.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A warm, southern feeling wine, it has herbs, spice and rich tannins as well as a crisper feel of acidity. Fruity, full of black currant and red berry fruits, forward and ripe. It's not for aging.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Homer is the reserve cuvée, a barrel-selection seemingly chosen for a bit of extra concentration. It retains its elegance, with scents of lavender, incense and Asian spices leading into bright, intense flavors of cherry and plum. The wine gathers itself in the midpalate, showing that fruit density, and finishes with a lick of chocolate. Drink 2018–2030.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This is aged four years prior to release, which proves a benefit here, as it helps tame the spicy wild-berry flavors. The aromatics offer an olfactory tapestry of orange peel, violets, sandalwood, cherry cola and more. It's balanced and sophisticated, offering many subtle pleasures.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This is a rich, very sweet dessert wine that tastes like some botrytis hit the grapes. It has intense flavors of apricot jam, pineapple-infused crème brûlée and butter-vanilla cookie flavors that are decadently delicious.",US-California-Riesling
"Entirely varietal, this wine is simple in its embrace of peach, pineapple and guava flavors, leaning ripe and bright atop a direct hit of freshness.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"A simple, big and fruity Malbec, softer than many although with all the right richness. This is a wine for drinking now, with its mature plum flavors and leather aroma. The French number for the department (county) of Cahors is 46.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Blackberry and vanilla make for a sweet, syrupy bouquet. The fruit on the palate is nice—it's mostly cherry and cassis. The finish is potent and slightly tart. Now it's hard to assess, as it's short on dimensions. Could use some time to integrate its components.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Borderline rustic, with edgy tannins and tart, jammy cherry and blueberry flavors that finish in a slightly sweet swirl of black pepper. Easy to drink now with pasta, barbecue, pizza.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Sweet and funky smelling, with a weird set of aromas that suggest Middle Eastern spice and hard-to-gauge fruit. The palate feel is barely acceptable, while the flavors are jumbled and overtly spicy and strange. Maybe it's the oak? Or maybe it's just not very good wine.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This is lighter in style, but nicely dry, balanced, appetizing and complete. It smells like red cherries and cranberries and tastes fresh, nicely tart and lively. At the same time it feels firmly tannic and palate-cleansing. This will be a super-versatile wine with food.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"While the bulk of this estate's wines are in prestigious Saint-Julien, this comes from a parcel in the Haut-Médoc. It's a rich and structured wine, full of black fruit and acidity. Although developing well, it still needs time. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This straightforward wine is still rather closed but slowly reveals delicate aromas of violets, wet soil and berries. The palate is on the austere side, offering red cherry, white pepper and clove alongside bracing tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Torrontés is usually a one-year wine, so this 2011 is showing well via flowery white-fruit aromas and notes of lychee and bath oil. The palate is largely fresh and full, with melon, lychee and tangerine flavors. A touch of wheat flavor and creaminess on the finish are the lone indications of age.",Argentina-Other-Torrontés
"Aromas of vanilla, cocoa and woodspice are at the fore. The palate starts out broadly but then trails as it moves toward the finish. This wine doesn't entirely come together.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Curious hints of candied citrus peel, dried fig and apricot abound in this exotically spiced Riesling. Laced with honey and sweet apple flavors, it's off dry in style, yet impeccably balanced by a strike of spine-tingling acidity. While deft and dainty in mouthfeel, it finishes on a lingering cardamom note.",US-New York-Riesling
"A wine that gives you everything you could possibly want: complexity, elegance, intensity and a long, creamy finish. Oreno is a 50-25-25 blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese (which prove to be perfect proportions in this case). It exhibits aromas of bright cherry, prune, plum, espresso grinds and cedar wood.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This wine surprises by being so very pretty—unexpected from such a hot site. Lovely scents of raspberry, strawberry, mint and spice lift the nose; the palate is medium-bodied, nicely tart, perfectly balanced and long. The mix of sweet and tart red fruits lasts deliciously, with the spice adding grace notes. Though blended and aged in 100% new French oak barrels, the oak is muted, and the fruit shines through.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Smoked beef and pork aromas with hints of flint, licorice and black currant show on the nose of this 45% Syrah, 43% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Petit Verdot blend. The palate is soft upon entry, growing sticky with robust tannins as it opens, and offering black peppercorn, teriyaki and lavish black cherry flavors. Drink 2019–2033.",US-California-Red Blend
"While round and supple in style, this has a puckering note of sour plums that mingle amid ripe blackberry and cherry flavors. It's uniquely tart and rich, but nuanced with fine, layered tannins and just a touch of brine that lingers on the finish.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"Aromas of toast, blue flowers, sage and mineral lead the nose. The bright palate offers red berry, clove, orange rind and roasted coffee beans alongside firm acidity and assertive tannins. Drink through 2020.",Italy-Lombardy-Nebbiolo
"Graceful and fragrant, this boasts alluring scents of rose, aromatic herb, flint, red berry and culinary spice. The elegant palate delivers red cherry, strawberry, white pepper and star anise alongside bright acidity and firm, refined tannins. Drink 2018–2026.",Italy-Piedmont-Red Blend
"A Zin-based blend with proportions of Syrah, Petit Verdot, Sangiovese, Petite Sirah and Malbec, this is a burly, decadent wine, fruity in blackberry and blueberry, with a swaddling of black licorice and chocolate. With restrained oak, it remains full bodied and velvety on the palate, sure to please many palates and low-key dinner nights.",US-California-Red Blend
"This almost 100% Cabernet Franc single-vineyard wine is perfumed and ripe. The velvet tannins and ripe black fruits are fine, structured and with enormous potential. The wine is generous, opulent and worthy of serious aging. Drink from 2027.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A big, ripe and jammy wine made from old vines. There are black plum fruits but the wine is dominated by licorice, black coffee and wood. It is powerful and very solid. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Merlot
"Pretty good for the the price. It's bone dry and zesty in acidity, with mouthwatering flavors of oranges, lemons and limes, finished with a touch of vanilla and white pepper.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Aromas of pressed white flower and orchard fruit waft from the glass. On the palate, a nutty note of toasted hazelnut and a mineral vein add depth to the dried apricot, baked yellow peach and citrus flavors. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Lombardy-Turbiana
"This huge, rich Zinfandel is ripe—nearly overripe—with dry raisin, blackberry and currant flavors. There's a curious bitterness to the finish that must come from the shriveled grape skins, which add to the wine's complexity. The vineyard is on the cooler, hillier western side of Paso Robles. Not a Zin for everyone, it's nevertheless a classic example of its genre.",US-California-Zinfandel
"All the secrets of this wine are still locked away—only time will reveal them. There are glimpses of lemon and grapefruit and notions of yeast on a thrillingly pure, streamlined and linear palate. Right now there is fruit, with time there will be eternal stone. This is Riesling with true pedigree. There is a lesson, too: You can impress with Federspiel, it does not always have to be Smaragd! Drink now until 2030.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"92–94. Barrel sample. Made from grapes grown in a specific parcel in the Léoville Las Cases vineyard, Clos du Marquis is a ripe wine that's also promises seriously good aging. Tannins and structure dominate the black fruits and acidity.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A late release, this wine is herbaceous and weedy, with a tease of tumbleweed on the nose. Spiky acidity supports elements of pencil lead and currant before a simple finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"COS is a natural, biodynamic and organic wine estate in southern Sicily and a leader in the rising popularity of the Cerasuolo di Vittoria denomination. This expression is particularly delicate and expressive, with nuanced layers of wild berry, white chocolate and cola.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"There's a very good wine here that's yearning to express itself, but it's locked inside a straitjacket of tannins. Feels hard, astringent and resistant in the mouth. But it's huge in concentrated blackberries, cherries, anise and cedar, and gives the impression of drama and importance. Give it at least five years, and it could develop well beyond that.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Standard berry aromas show touches of raisin and earth, but not too much of either. It feels fresh, crisp and alert, with cherry tomato, berry fruit, tobacco and vanilla flavors. This feels healthy but not real deep or complex on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Fans of Barbera will find the hard acids and thick tannins they love in this rustic Italian variety. The flavors are all dry: dried blackberries and cherries, dried leather, cured tobacco leaf, beef jerky, star anise. Yet there's a fruity sweetness that's charming. Great with almost anything starring sausage.",US-California-Barbera
"With some age, this is a gloriously ripe and toasty wine. It has a rich character emphasized by the round texture and the creamy mousse. It also has great concentration, bringing together acidity as well as dense secondary flavors. With its rich, mature character, it is best suited for food. It is ready to drink, but will hold well through 2025.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This has a slightly aged appearance and tertiary aromas of candied berry, leather, tobacco and cola. The tannins are firm and tight; it still has an aging future ahead.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"With its fine aged-wood and fruit character, this is a sweet yet complex wine. Toast, almonds, a hint of spirit and the palate and delicate acidity all combine easily in a harmonious wine whose closest comparison is with a great amontillado.",Portugal-Port-Port
"A deep red color and concentrated aromas and flavors of dark berries, dark chocolate and pomegranate are offset nicely by a layered texture laced with fine tannins. This well-structured wine will be great with a juicy steak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"It's not easy to get 16.5% alcohol from a vintage as cool as 2010 in Washington. The wine has a grain and grass bouquet, wild and brambly fruit, and plenty of Asian spices. Interesting, though not especially typical for the grape variety",US-Washington-Merlot
"Rich fruit flavors and aromatic complexity make this full-bodied wine tempting and satisfying. Aromas suggest ripe, seemingly sweet cherry plus whiffs of cedar, and the flavors are expressive and layered, carried on a velvety texture that melts in the mouth.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Soft and inviting on the plushly texture nose, this bottling by a Napa winery sourcing from the iconic Santa Maria vineyard offers popcorn, butterscotch, fresh apple blossom and salted stone-fruit aromas. The flavors are classic and straightforward in the citrusy style, with Meyer lemon, nectarine, pineapple and butter.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Uncomplicated yet tasty, this medium-bodied, mild-textured wine has a pure raspberry/strawberry character from the bright aroma to the ripe flavors to the lingering finish. The balance is on the soft side due to low acidity and little astringency from tannins.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This wine offers a spicy, green nose with tones of herbs, grass, blackberry and mint. It has a raw, thick feel with fresh fruit nuances and sour cherry on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Gritty rubbery aromas are slightly acrid, like asphalt. This is standard in feel, with generic berry flavors. Herbal spice and mild heat control the finish. Beyond that, there's not much to say about this simple Cab.",Chile-Central Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Getting past the giant blast of oak that dominates the bouquet is not an easy task, but the intrepid wood chopper will find another side to this wine, one that's full of bright, juicy black fruit and syrupy core sweetness. Of course, the oak is always present and with that comes mocha, coffee and vanilla notes. Imported by Gascon USA.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Luscious blackberry and cherry notes are marked with hints of bramble and spice in this bold yet elegantly framed wine. The palate feels lush and warm with judicious oak, yet bright, with a shower of cranberry acidity and fine-grain tannins that penetrate through the finish.",US-New York-Merlot

"This is a pristine albeit easy wine with clean and compact aromas of stone fruit, yellow flower and zesty citrus. Genuine and aromatic, this is textbook Pinot Grigio with pleasing creaminess on the palate. Pair with pasta salad, grilled white meats and finger foods.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Candied, grassy aromas set up a dilute palate with green, almost weedy red-fruit flavors. The finish tastes like grape skins, with an animal-like side note.",Spain-Northern Spain-Rosado

"Rich, ripe and concentrated, the lush array of black fruits is enhanced with a generous amount of barrel-generated baking spices. There's a chef's pantry of cinnamon, ginger and more, along with a vein of molasses and a whiff of coffee running through the tannins. It's a total yum-fest.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"From the estate vines, this toasty wine will please those who love a soft and buttery style of Chardonnay. Buttered popcorn, toasted walnuts, soft and ripe tropical fruits all come into play; Bonair's definable house style.",US-Washington-Chardonnay

"A chunky, solid wine, its tannins as important as its fruitiness. It shows black fruits, ripe bitter cherry flavors, along with dense tannins. Offering a powerful blast of Pinot Noir, and worth aging for three years.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This comes from a six-acre vineyard of 30-year-old vines. It is steely and taut with an almost flinty character. As a contrast, the young fruit is crisp, full of citrus and green plum fruits. It is a ripe wine that has a few more months to be at its best. Wait until 2018.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This bold effort opens with notes of jammy blackberry and prune. It is soft and slightly sweet, with flavors of of plush fruit and cinnamon.",Italy-Southern Italy-Primitivo
"Generic pear and apple aromas are simple but good. This wine runs light on oak and feels juicy and correct. Flavors of apple, pear and vanilla turn more briny and salty on the finish, which circles back with sweetness as it fades away.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"Racy, zesty aromas of honey and squeezed orange form the nose of this still-tight wine, a blend of 62% Grenache Blanc and 38% Rousanne from a vineyard at the mouth of the Arroyo Seco appellation. The crisp palate offers pear and apple cider flavors with a finish of honeydew melon. A perfect pairing for halibut and shellfish.",US-California-Rhône-style White Blend

"From 30-year-old vines, this is one of the finest examples of this variety to come out of the state in recent vintages. It delivers citrus, candlewax, lees, apple and pear aromas, the palate sleekly styled with a blast of acidity that makes it a versatile pour for the dinner table.",US-Washington-Chenin Blanc

"Rich and full-bodied, it's full of tropical fruits that dominate the ripe texture. Hints of wood are there as well as the natural crisp acidity of Sauvignon Blanc. It needs time to develop and bring out all its ripe flavors. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Underbrush, ripe berry, new leather and Mediterranean herb aromas slowly take shape in the glass. Showing youthful tension, the vibrant palate delivers red cherry, pomegranate, white pepper and pipe tobacco notes framed by bright acidity and taut, refined tannins. It already shows great balance and finesse but is still young and tight. Drink 2022–2035.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"From vineyards close to Juliénas, this is a bright wine full of cherry juice and fresh acidity. It does have a sense of structure with a background of tannins and minerality that will allow it to age, although it is delicious now.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Bracing and tangy, this light-bodied wine has distinct melon aromas, similar flavors and tasty accents of white pepper and fresh fennel. While nicely reserved it also has complexity and great balance.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

"Toasty aromas go through to the palate, highlighting the wood aging. It is tense, mineral, packed with apple and lemon acidity. The aftertaste is equally crisp and bright.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This new project from the heights of Atlas Peak involves Steve Matthiasson as both viticulturist and winemaker, having had to take over the reins from the late Denis Malbec.

Notes of chocolate, fig and cigar sit atop a pillowy, complex structure, while vanilla lingers on the finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Finely structured, this has become an impressive wine, gaining in intensity as it develops. The tannins are powerful but come from concentrated fruit as much as from wood. It is becoming a powerhouse of ripe flavors. This is a wine that shows how Malescot St-Exupéry is joining the top ranks in Margaux.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Muted florals make way for a creamy, lush and moderately weighty white wine. The measured acidity supports ripe, fruity flavors of fig and Bosc pear.",US-California-Pinot Gris

"Sweet and simple, with jammy raspberry and bubblegum flavors.",US-California-Shiraz
"An intense wine, this is certainly full-bodied, but has fruit weight and concentrated power to match. Beautiful yellow stone fruits—apricots, peaches—are super ripe, their richness allied to sweet acidity, pink grapefruit tones and a smooth, almost oily texture. The one downside is the alcoholic burn that shows through, an unfortunate end to an otherwise spectacular wine.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Juicy, fresh tangerine and peach flavors shine brightly on the palate of this vibrantly fruity Riesling. Approachable yet elegant, it offers uncomplicated refreshment with delicately lingering sweetness marking the finish. Drink now through 2018.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"This is an austere, elegant study in power and grace, blending 53% Merlot with 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc. Substantial and tannin-defined as many of its brethren of this vintage, it shows cedar, pencil shavings and a touch of tobacco, more savory than fruit-driven. Drink now through 2023.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Tight and fruity, this is a crisp wine with considerable acidity. It has a fresh, crisp background, cut with a mineral texture and a stony, steely character. This wine, with its structure, needs to age; drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Melon, nectarine and minerally aromas are textbook as far as Albariño goes. The palate on this ready-to-drink winner is a bit fleshy, but with ample spine. Melon, lees and white pepper flavors finish clean and true, with firm malic acidity.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"This is a powerful bully of a wine but a good value in the pricey Barolo category. Sweaty, masculine aromas lead to a concentrated palate framed by strapping tannins and flavors of black earth and violets. Medium finish. Give it a few years to grow up.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Passion fruit, kiwi fruit and hints of strawberry mark the nose of this wine. It's strident, intense and a bit one-dimensionally fruity, yet packs a lot of flavor into a refreshing, medium-bodied wine.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"A step up in weight, texture and concentration from VM's Private Bin bottling, Cellar Selection is the middle tier of the company's Sauvignon Blancs. Delicate leafy characters mark the nose, but the emphasis is on the engaging gooseberry and pink grapefruit notes. Textures of silk and cream add richness to the palate, lingering on the mouthwatering finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Thin and green flavors dominate this Cabernet Franc. Small amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot do not seem to have made an impact. It's sharp, stiff, and quite herbal.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"A really rich Cabernet, jam-packed with blackberry, cherry, raspberry and mocha flavors that are slightly sweet, with a brown sugar taste. The sweetness comes from the caramelized oak, not residual sugar, but the wine does have a candied quality. A bit rustic now. Give it 5–6 years and try again.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Muted at first, this wine opens up nicely with time. Sweet, ripe and easy on the finish, its core is full of black pepper and clove. The grapes are sourced from several distinctive vineyards in Mendocino County. Drink it with a steak.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A very well-made Merlot, with sweet fruit and attractive scents of vanilla and cracker. Though still showing a lot of youthful acidity, it wraps the fruit in a big blast of new oak and finishes with a hint of heat.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Unmistakably Sauvignon Blanc, it carries notes of herbs, citrus and guava. It's lightly spritzy and drinks dry with mouthwatering citrus flavors. Try it with shellfish.",US-Oregon-Sauvignon Blanc
"Grainy, oaky aromas of clove, cinnamon and wood spice sit atop minimal white-fruit notes. This feels lean and linear, with overriding resiny barrel influences. Savory and forceful oak flavors dominate tart apple notes, while this offers mostly resin and spice on the finish.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"The raspberry and cherry flavors are a bit obvious at first, but then the balanced tannins and acids become apparent, and the tasteful application of sweet, smoky oak surfaces. This wine grows more interesting as it sits in the glass. Drink it now and over the next 3–4 years for maximum freshness.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Tight and precisely hewn, this is crystal clear and medium weight while pushing strawberry and cherry fruit into the core. Its 14 months in one-quarter new French oak added hints of vanilla custard.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This structured Barbera offers aromas of ripe cherry, raspberry and plum with light toasted notes. The palate delivers a tight core of black cherry with black pepper and licorice, layered with a hint of espresso. This still needs a year or two to fully unwind, so it's best after 2015.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"Aromas of underbrush, rose petal, flint and dark spice waft out of the glass. The structured elegant palate offers red-cherry, raspberry, clove and star anise flavors set against fresh acidity and a firm backbone of refined tannins. Give this time to let the nervous energy calm down and you'll be rewarded with even more complexity. Drink 2020–2035.",Italy-Piedmont-Red Blend
"This is the best Potelle Syrah I've ever had, but be forewarned: It's an extraordinarily tannic wine that shows its 1,800-foot mountain origins. It clocks in at 13.9% alcohol, yet it's bone dry. The fruit is powerfully concentrated in blackberries enhanced with sweet, smoky oak. If ever there was a Syrah for the cellar, this is it. Best now (if you like young tannic wines, but please decant) and for at least eight years, as it gradually mellows.",US-California-Syrah
"Orange-pink in color, this is ripe, full rosé. It has plenty of acidity as well as a crisp texture. The weight of the wine puts its firmly in the food category of rosé.",France-Southwest France-Rosé
"Full in style, with sweet aromas of black fruit. Feels chunky, with fatty tasting oak leading herbal, simple flavors of blackberry and dark plum. A ripe wine with a round mouthfeel but not much in the way of elegance or refinement.",Chile-Maule Valley-Pinot Noir
"Minty green aromas blend with leathery red-fruit scents on what amounts to a gritty bouquet. The mouthfeel on this single-vineyard Malbec is rubbery, rugged and tannic, with a beam of tangy acidity keeping it moving. Flavors of rubber, salty berry and spice are sharp, and the finish is tannic.",Argentina-Other-Malbec
"This is a dry wine, more about structure than fruit. The tannins and the firm extraction shows strongly. It is not enjoyable.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Truffle, new leather and plum are some of the aromas you'll find in this taut red. The palate delivers Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and earthy game flavors, set against bright acidity and tightly wound tannins. Drink 2018–2023.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"This is always a really good buy among rosé sparklers and a personal favorite in the Best Buy category.

It's dry, spicy and fairly smooth on the finish.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend

"With its creamy texture and ripe apple fruits, this is a rich, rounded style. It is certainly fresh while also having yellow and white stone fruit flavors cut by acidity and citrus.

Take this 2004 Barbaresco: The wine is very alive and bright with firm tannins and a long finish that will gain traction over the next decade.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

It's lovely and evocative.",US-Washington-Rhône-style White Blend

"The nose is shy and merely hints at lemon zestiness. The palate also opens with lemon zest but in a very concentrated full-on fashion with a citrus blast.

The finish is whistle-clean and very refreshing.",France-Alsace-Riesling

"A warm, uncomplicated wine. The nose delivers oak and aromas of balsamic dressing, pencil shavings and chunky blackberry. Chunky is also the best way to describe the palate, which emphasizes blackberry, cherry and plum. Size is both the wine's virtue and bane, and in the final count the 2005 Alcance Carmenère seemed better balanced.",Chile-Maule Valley-Carmenère

"Just one barrel was produced from this nine-acre site in the heart of the AVA. This is picture perfect, refined and textural, with flavors that roll from rose petals to strawberries to Bing cherries. A well-framed touch of oak (noted as neutral, yet detectable) contributes to an elongated finish that begs for the next glass. Still young and compact, this should drink its best from 2018 through 2028.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"The vineyard has been a consistent source of good to great Pinot Noirs for Paraiso winery. Now La Rochelle dips into it, with successful results.

A thick palate is sliced by bright acidity.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Made half in stainless steel and half in neutral oak, this comes from 34-year-old vines. It's quite dry, with interesting nuances of sweet grass, clover and green apple. The acids are borderline sour; try this with a bit of prosciutto and a salty cheese.",US-Oregon-Riesling

"This is a polished, smooth, ripe-smelling Toro with an inky color and earthy undertones to the bouquet. Full, tannic and voluminous, this tastes mostly of blackberry and prune, while the finish is similar in taste and lush in texture. This is more forward and ripe than complex and nuanced; drink through 2021.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro
"This bottling showcases Jim Clendenen's brilliance at making light wines packed with flavor.

"Ser Gioveto is 80% Sangiovese with small additions of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. It has a deeply saturated ruby color and compelling aromas of ripe fruit, strawberry, rum cake and soft spice. There's a jammy accent in the bouquet that gives momentum to its rich, velvety mouthfeel.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"This is a hefty, chewy wine, whose alcohol flirts with 15%, but whose ample fruit is buttressed with chalk, earth, steel and tannin. Dark and loaded with smoky graphite, it should be decanted for some hours before serving. How will it cellar? Could go for decades, but it's too soon to call.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This Malibu winery's bottling from the historic Bien Nacido vineyard is lush with lemon curd, buttered croissant and brown spice aromas. The palate is both plush and vibrant, its apple cream and poached pear favors enlivened with sea salt, lemon rind and slate accents. It's complex and awesome.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The palest pink fizz exudes notes of tart blackcurrant and aromatic blackcurrant leaf in this rare Cabernet Sauvignon-based sparkling. The palate is light, dry, softly fizzing and ticks all the boxes of an elegant, refreshing traditional-method sparkling wine. The blackcurrant notions are softer on the palate but they echo with every tiny bubble that bursts.

Drink now.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rosé
"Berry and cinnamon aromas are lightly woody and spicy. This is tannic but not mean or fierce.

Given that 2013 was a cold vintage, this Crianza deserves praise.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend

"This is an interesting and potentially very beautiful wine that probably needs many more years of cellar aging before it is fully formed. At this young stage it shows raw notes of rhubarb, cola and spice backed by dark licorice overtones. It's drying and tight with jackhammer tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"There is a fine mineral texture to this structured, firm wine from the northern Haut-Médoc. It also has ripe fruit and a richly tannic character, with flavors of black plum juice and berry.

"A Bordeaux blend from Newton's mountain estate, this lovely wine starts out with a fat, fleshy appeal. It offers elaborate waves of sweetly smoked oak that conjoin nicely with cherry preserves, red licorice and dark chocolate. A bit inelegant now due to firm, fierce tannins, but so balanced, it should easily negotiate the years. Better after 2012.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Savory smoke and nut tones contrast richly with extracted black cherry and berry flavors in this full-bodied Spätburgunder. While fine-grained tannins and a shock of cranberry acidity lend balance and grace, shades of toast and spice are still quite prominent.

"All coming from a single block of the winery's estate vineyard, this is a 100% varietal, aged in half new French oak.

"Exotic, earthy aromas of loamy blackberry, pencil eraser, brown sugar and violet petals lead to a deep but wiry and clipped-feeling palate. The flavor profile is oaky, with spiced berry and cardamom notes leading the charge. A lasting finish is stern and doesn't waver. Drink through 2020.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This tastes overripe and Port-like. The flavors are of raisins, currants, licorice and sweet caramelized oak. This is unlikely to evolve positively, so drink now.",US-California-Syrah

"La Vis's Dipinti series has preformed well thanks to attractive pricing. This expression of Sauvignon offers evident herbal characteristics, as well as mineral ones. Think chopped sage and basil and drying white stone.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"There seems to be too much wood here which is smothering the fruit. Given that, the wine does have weight and as the wood softens, the juicy fruit flavors should come through. Wait to drink until 2016. But it will always be austere.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Blended with some Sémillon for complexity, this is a dry, tart wine with green flavors that are relieved by hints of mangoes and new oak. It shows all the likeability of Sauvignon Blanc, including bright acidity and a slightly sweet finish of honey.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

"Deep and lavish aromas of baked black currant, caramel, condensed violets and fudge get a licorice lift on the nose of this blend of 41% Syrah, 41% Grenache and 18% Mourvèdre.

Flavors of chocolate, cherry, plum, tar, resin and licorice are all recognizable.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Dark and smoky, this wine is relatively tannic and emphasizes flavors of leaf, bark, root and herb. There's plenty of depth and exceptional power to this wine, which seems unique among New World Tempranillos.",US-Oregon-Tempranillo
"Bright acidity translates to the aromas in this bottling: laser-sharp lime zest, squeezed grapefruit, dewy grass and wet gravel. Those scents grow riper as the wine warms, while the palate seems sweeter—more lime candy than fresh lime. It finishes tart, with a wet metal freshness.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"A crisp, dry wine, very fresh, dominated by grapefruit and lemon flavors, with a light texture of green fruit skins. This is as fresh as can be, but it has a good density of flavor to balance.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"Assembled from dozens of individual lots, this sumptuous brut is an example of the art of blending.

"One of the iconic wines of Portugal, the brand dates back to the 15th century and the Portuguese discovery of Brazil. In its latest incarnation, it is hugely dense and concentrated. It could be that it is too much, with dark extracts, yet somehow the super-ripe plum and berry flavors are given enough freshness. The structure is all there in what is still a young wine. With power and a dense texture, the wine needs to age further. Drink from 2020.",Portugal-Alentejo-Portuguese Red
"Big and brooding with richly concentrated black plums and velvety, mouthfilling tannins, Roman Roth's namesake Merlot is boldly structured, but beautifully nuanced as well, with sprays of violet perfume and just a whiff of wet, earthy forest and dried herb notes.

It's rich and mouthfilling, yet impeccably structured, with a long, delicately tannic finish.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"On the nose, aromas of russet apple and pear skin mingle with fresh citrus zest and a hint of ripe pear.

The palate has a real dynamic energy and is lovely now but will be even lovelier in two or three years' time.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner

Dark, earthy and leathery, this wine is holding onto its tannin and oak, but given time to rest in the cellar 5–7 years, it'll scream to be served with cassoulet.",US-California-Syrah

"Aromas of dark berry, leather, cured meat and a balsamic note lead the way. The tightly wound palate offers raw red berry, cooking spice, coffee and Alpine herb alongside bracing tannins. It closes on a licorice note.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"An enticing smell of lemon sorbet fills the nose and the effect on the palate is much the same: bracing, cleansing deliciousness pervades everything. There is a hint of crunchy, crisp green apple combined with far richer notions of lemon zest and mandarin peel. Deeper down resides an earthy, yeasty core and a salty, stoniness. This is very young now and will show its true but thrilling citrus-tinted colors with some bottle age. Drink 2018–2025.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"This relatively lightweight Pinot Noir features an array of meaty, earthy notes and a modest pie-cherry flavor before drying out and turning even more tart on the finish. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"This wine definitely shows a ripe side in its cured meat, tobacco, sandalwood, smoked bacon and old spice. Delivers a rich, plump feel in the mouth, backed by gritty tannins and bright acidity. Despite the cooler vintage, this wine packs power, heat and a tiny touch of sweetness on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Hints of bramble and smoke add savoriness to fresh apple and pear flavors in this almost-dry Riesling. The palate is piercingly high in acidity, but zesty lemon and lime flavors are bright and invigorating.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Strong barrel-driven aromas of clove and wood spice sit atop ripe berry fruit scents. This Pinot Noir is chewy, plump and on the heavy side. Oaky berry and plum flavors come with spicy clove notes that don't quit on the finish.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir
"This is a light and friendly white wine that would pair well with salads and vegetarian dishes. The wine has easygoing aromas of yellow fruit and some dusty mineral tones for extra dimension. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.",Italy-Southern Italy-Fiano
"Beaucoup d'oak. Delicious, toasty, roasty, mocha-flavored oak. But the fruit is missing in action. The color suggests that there is some light, plummy fruit underlying all the oak, but it's hiding.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This classic vineyard delivers the goodies—ripe, round and quite pretty flavors of raspberry and cherry fruit, with orange peel highlights. The tangy acidity keeps it lively and the length suggests that it will drink well through the mid-2020s.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A vibrantly fruity wine, with lemon, lime, pineapple and grapefruit flavors brightened with zesty acidity. It's basically dryish to off-dry, with a touch of honey on the finish. Good price for an easy cocktail sipper.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Ripe aromas are full of cherries and plums, with a hint of pine. Concentrated flavors recall dark cherries and cinnamon. The texture is full and broad with moderate tannins and fresh acidity to keep it lively.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is an elegant, intricate wine that's fresh and lively while layered with attractive green apple, white pepper and thyme flavors. Light bodied, it makes a great apéritif or pairing with fish and fowl.",US-California-White Blend
"A light wood-aging flavor gives this wine its richness along with its fine ripe yellow fruits. Ripe and fruity from an excellent year for white Bordeaux, the wine is smooth and ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"What a powerfully lovely, lilting and blockbuster of a wine this is. Seamless in baked rhubarb and a velvety texture it never stops impressing, allowing for nuanced explosions of black cherry and Asian spice to coat the palate and become more complex the longer each sip lingers. Deliciously drinkable now, the wine will take on additional wow factor over time.",US-California-Pinot Noir
This medium-bodied wine comes off as pure and focused. It shows bright and concentrated fruit aromas and delicious red cherry and raspberry flavors. The refreshing texture derives from the firm tannins and energizing acidity.,US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is dry, smooth and creamy in the mouth, with rich flavors of black currants, Kahlua liqueur and toasty oak, as well as a stony minerality. It will continue to drink well through 2018.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
This fresh and food-friendly Pinot Grigio opens with delicate floral notes of white rose and almond blossom followed by exotic fruit and citrus. The balanced acidity would pair with chicken salad and mayonnaise.,Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"You won't find much fruit in this Merlot, but you will find tons of white pepper. There is a flavor of sour cherry candy, and the palate is dry and austere.",US-California-Merlot
"A blend of Minnick and Ash Hollow grapes, this is a punchy, high-toned take on Syrah. Particularly attractive are the bright raspberry flavors, peppered with, well, pepper! It's got the kind of verve that you find in a simple Grenache, and finishes light and tangy.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Raspberry and cherry aromas are mild while not stirring much excitement. This feels a bit raw and tannic, but it's got enough body to hold up. Berry and plum flavors finish with hints of spice and chocolate.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"All varietal, this wine offers unique aromas of toast, fig, dried herb and exotic spice. The purple fruit flavors are deft in style with a pleasing sense of balance, length and texture.",US-Washington-Malbec
"Very rich in oak, with massive buttered toast, caramel and crème brûlée flavors. The underlying fruit is good, suggesting pineapples and ripe peaches, but misses a beat for all that winemaker intervention. Drink now.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Orange peel notes on the nose of this wine lead to a rounded, soft and fruity palate of juicy peaches and nectarines. A pleasant soft bitterness frames the fruit, giving texture and structure to the palate. The pithy finish is off dry, but beautifully balanced.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Zinfandel from old vines is rarely this light and refreshing, yet still exuberant in fruit. A mix of tart cherry and just-ripe blackberry comes with a lingering edge of citrus around the cinnamon and black pepper spice. Funky earth ripples through the middle, before a subtle take on leather finishes things out.",US-California-Zinfandel
Damask rose and honeysuckle on the nose almost have a cotton-candy tang to them. The palate is medium sweet and adds peach compote to the floral notes and a dollop of plump luscious sweetness. There is huge concentration and big aromatic intensity on the midpalate with a lovely bitter edge that lasts long. There is a medium-sweet finish.,France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Juicy and open, with complex honey notes overlapping with key lime and apricot flavors. A bit rounder in the mouth than most of its brethren, this Clare Valley Riesling finishes on the simple side but with some truly mouthwatering lemon-meringue notes. Drink now.",Australia-South Australia-Riesling
"Long maturation in French oak lends a distinctly nutty, smoky tone to this brambly berried Merlot. While bold in body and a touch warm in alcohol, its ripe black-fruit flavors are sharpened by cranberry acidity and firm, penetrating tannins. A hint of cocoa powder lingers on the finish.",US-New York-Merlot
"Scratchy, horsey berry aromas set up a fresh, regular palate. Plum, berry and peppery flavors are basic, while the finish dries out fast while showing a wood character along with juicy acidity.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Cab Franc is an emerging variety in Mendoza and this jammy fleshy version won't hurt the cause. Inky berry aromas are wide and fruity, not specific. A full-volume palate is a bit heavy, with blackberry, chocolate and peppery flavors. The finish hangs around with similar flavors, grapy weight and just enough acidity to maintain integrity.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Franc
"Among Garage Wine's 2014 single-vineyard Carignans and blends, this might be the best one. Bagual is a Carignan-Garnacha-Mataro blend that's earthy and full of black-fruit aromas and foresty notes. A staunch tight palate shows some elasticity, while this tastes of earthy berry fruits and cola. A dense but not overly aggressive finish seals this away. Drink through 2025.",Chile-Maule Valley-Red Blend
"This is labeled Methode Champenoise, though its time on the lees was minimal. It's a bit of a sourball, a mix of green apple and lemon, but would be a knockout with raw oysters.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"This wine is half Merlot with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon (31%), Cabernet Franc (16%), Petit Verdot (2%) and Malbec. It draws you into the glass with high-toned aromas of dried herbs, espresso, red and black fruit, along with floral notes. The palate is poised and polished, showing depth, texture and layering well beyond its weight class. It appeals on every level.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"There's a pure, sweet Cabernet in the bottle that wants to come out, but it's held back right now with sturdy tannins that make for a palate astringency. The flavors are explosive, of blackberries, cassis, cherries, chocolate and smoky new oak. Needs time. Best after 2011 and well beyond.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This has the capacity to rev-up any meat-based meal thanks to its aromatic intensity and overall spiciness. Sweet and savory at the same time, it delivers black cherry, clove, smoked bacon, leather, cola and dried fruit aromas.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"The top of the range from Château Ponzac, this is, as its alcohol suggests, pretty powerful. Almost black in color, it's a solid, chunky wine that still has its youthful tannins. Black fruits, berries and damsons are layered with wood and fruit tannins, giving a dense and concentrated character. It needs to age, so drink from 2018.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"So sweet in berry jam and mocha flavors, it's basically a dessert wine. If you like that style, it's pretty good.",US-California-Red Blend
"Done in a forward tutti–frutti style, this puts all the flavor right up front. Grape candy is what comes to mind, with a light tannic finish. It's a good gulping wine for decks, campers and picnic outings.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A grapy, clamped nose lacks nuance. In the mouth, this is raw and choppy, with fresh red-fruit acidity. Red-berry and oak flavors finish woody, with ample spice and juicy acidity.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"Clean, tart and herbal, this Sauvignon Blanc has front-and-center flavors of bright citrus and green apple. A slight hint of baking spice comes through on the finish.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"Dark colored for a modern rosé, this is a ripe blend of two Cabernets, Syrah and Tannat. Red fruits and a rich texture make for a wine that is almost sweet in character, certainly floral and perfumed. Drink now.",France-Southwest France-Rosé
"Bright, forceful and slightly reductive, this white is aged less than a year in neutral French oak, allowing the fruit to speak and offer richness on the midpalate. Gingerbread and lemongrass flavors accent its essential core of green apple fruit.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The estate wine from Sacha Lichine's Château d'Esclans discloses deeper color than some rosés from Provence. It has a ripe feel, smooth red fruits and a touch of toastiness. Full-bodied and dry, it is definitely a food rosé, and best left until late 2014 before drinking.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This sparkling wine opens with oak aromas. It has a frothy palate that reveals tropical fruit, citrus and oak notes, sprinkled with Mediterranean herbs. Despite the creamy texture, the flavors are lean and close on a bitter walnut note.",Italy-Lombardy-Chardonnay
"Tart Montmorency cherry meshes with a cedary cigar-box note on the nose of this wine. The palate is fruit-driven with ripe cherries and blueberries, lifted slightly by anise and bay-leaf spices.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine comes from Château le Gardera on the slopes above the Garonne river in the Entre-deux-Mers region. It's a big, wood-aged and spicy wine that's full of attractive red berry fruits. There is a dry core of tannin, so the wine could age although it is quite ready to drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Green beans and other vegetal notes combine with pineapple, rancid butter and wet wool in this rather odd Chardonnay. There's plenty of acidity and a creamy mouthfeel, but it's all a little out of balance.",Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"This bold Sauvignon opens with classic varietal fragrances of crushed tomato vine, stone fruit and honeydew melon. The creamy palate delivers layers of white peach, apricot, cantaloupe and mineral supported by fresh acidity. Balance and structure seamlessly support the alcohol.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"Made from 80% Syrah, 15% Grenache and 5% Riesling, this magenta-hued wine shows exuberant orange blossom and cherry flavors buoyed by moderate acidity and seaspray-like freshness. It finishes rich and fruity, bringing a creamsicle in summer to mind.",US-California-Syrah
"Attractively pink in color, this has a touch of caramel as well as ripe strawberry fruit flavors. It has a rich side, but is bright and fruity with lively acidity at the end. It will be great as an apéritif.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"This Malbec-led blend (with Petit Verdot and Tannat) is muscular and piercing on the nose, with aromas of brick dust, black cherry, cassis and raisin. The palate is saturated and creamy, with a lactic sensation competing with rubbery tannins. Flavors of vanilla, raw oak, tomato, plum, herbs and chocolate are complex and finish with multiple interest points along with mild heat. Give this more time, if possible. Best from 2018 through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Raymond brings their expert Cabernet touch to this Syrah. It has the rich, balanced tannins you expect from a Napa red wine, along with oodles of juicy blackberries, blueberries and cherries. But the smoked meat and black pepper notes belong to Syrah.",US-California-Syrah
"This wine is all spice and sweetness. If the sense of terroir is missing, it does offer ripe swathes of apricot and spiced pear flavors lathered with honey. Drink now.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"This blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah offers balance and harmony, with no aromatic element out of place. It presents a steady wall of black fruit, soft cherry, tobacco, rum cake and dark leather. The soft, velvety tannins make this a great pasta or lasagna wine.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"Tight and aromatically intense, this delivers layers of ripe fruit, prune, black pepper, blackberry jelly and cinnamon. Those beautiful tones are followed by soft, velvety tannins.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Slightly soapy in the nose, this enters softly, then turns sharp and slightly bitter. Hints of melon and butter emerge, but the mouthfeel is somewhat disjointed and the flavors not yet fully integrated.",US-Oregon-Pinot Blanc
"The wine has power and considerable wood flavors at this young stage. It also has concentration of white and yellow fruits, well laced with acidity. Powerful while always balanced and stylish.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese White
"Thin, with acidic cherry flavors and a touch of oak. Saved by dryness and a nice Pinot silkiness.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A blend of various estates from the Paso Robles region, this wine shows roasted pork with blackberry hoisin sauce, black rocks and a touch of dill on the nose. Notable tannins provide lasting structure, with flavors of black olive, tobacco ash, peppercorns, dark chocolate and deep black fruit that will need a tad more time to unravel.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromatically, this wine is currently subdued, with the notes of raspberry, cocoa and cherry that haven't fully blossomed. The flavors meanwhile are generous and ripe, while still showing a fine sense of balance. Additional time in the bottle or a long decant should allow it to open up.",US-Washington-Merlot
The wine is light and fruity—properly crisp with attractive acidity. The red fruits shine through the light texture and touch of spice creates a bright wine full of final fruitiness.,France-Provence-Rosé
"This blend from a newer Westside Paso winery offers blackberry, charred pine and sour cherry aromas. The palate is driven by pine sap, charred game and sharp herbs such as oregano and rosemary, and would be a great way to spice up a steak dinner.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Made from Loire Valley fruit, this has the tangy, herbal character typical of cool-climate wines. Drink now.",France-France Other-Sauvignon Blanc
"A smoky scent and earthy, crisp-apple flavors make this medium-bodied wine a change of pace from the average butterball Chardonnay. It has welcome acidity and a nicely smooth texture.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Mature, earthy and soft on the nose, with roasted, spicy, integrated berry aromas. Full but baked feeling, with maturity and monotone flavors of sweet berries that don't vary. It remains roasted and warm on the finish. Drink soon.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"This is a fruity, fragrant wine with light fruitiness and deliciously crisp acidity. Red berry flavors are lined with red apple acidity and a texture that shows a touch of minerality from the Grand Cru vineyards on the Montagne de Reims. Unusually for a rosé Champagne, this is made principally from Pinot Noir, with color coming from the skins rather than from adding red wine to the blend.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Rubbery and earthy smelling on first take, with bulky, dark berry aromas mixed with herbal notes. Shows tannic bite and grab along with standard, herbal flavors of blackberry and black olive. Finishes similarly. Good Cab for $7.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made with 100% Sangiovese, this conveys aromas of violet, vanilla, pressed powder and perfumed berry. The vibrant, structured palate delivers juicy wild cherry, licorice, black pepper and toast alongside firm tannins and fresh acidity. It finishes on a mocha note. Drink 2015–2022.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Smooth-textured Port, with sweet red fruits under the brown sugar, nut and spirit flavors. This is certainly on the sweet side, with a velvet feel to it.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Some yeasty funk hits the nose first. Underneath that sits and earthy, if slender, dry Riesling which has a subtle understated richness that seems very firmly anchored in earth. Pithy citrus zest frames and illuminates and promises future pleasure. This needs a little bottle age. Drink 2018–2030.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"The nose gives away very little. The palate has exquisite lightness, with a fine spray of tender spritz that accentuates the slight white-pepper notes. Lemon and green pear shimmer through. This is light but refreshing, with a clean, spicy lemon finish.",Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
"Aromas of white orchard fruit, spring wildflower and a hint of nut unfold on this bright wine. The round, structured palate tastes of Williams pear, apple and a bitter almond note alongside fresh acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Friulano
"This wine is ripe and full of attractive fruit. With a light touch of pepper as well as rich apples, it is shot through with acidity. Full in the mouth, it finishes with taut minerality.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"This is a big, tannic and dry Syrah that seems built for the cellar, but an unripe note of green peppercorn verging on bell pepper rules that out. So drink now and appreciate the blackberries and oak.",US-California-Syrah
"A little aggressive in feline spray notes, but pulls back just in time to let the gooseberry, grapefruit, lemon and lime flavors star. Crisp acidity provides fortunate balance to this sweetly fruit wine.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Floral aromas, white peach and mineral tones make for a harmonious and elegant sparkler with a pretty, vibrant appearance in the glass. Fruity, nutty flavors add sophistication and elegance in the mouth.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"A very different composition from the 2007 Les Chevaux, this year's blend is 34% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Syrah, 8% Cabernet Franc and 8% Malbec. It's a tannic wine, and seems to put a lot of emphasis on the vanilla/tobacco flavors that characterize so many blended reds these days. Fair value, but somewhat generic.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Just might be the best $25 Chard out there. Gorgeous and dramatic in opulence, with a creamy texture, and tremendous in ripe tropical fruit, smoky oak and vanilla flavors. There's a long, honeyed, buttercreamy finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Subdued aromas of moist soil, funk, ember and smoke are followed by supersmooth cranberry, cherry and savory flavors, along with abundant earth accents. It brings an appealing sense of texture, although it's quite reserved in style for a Rocks wine.",US-Washington-Syrah
"In perfect proportion, this estate-grown, biodynamically farmed wine brings a sweet-tart fruit intensity to bear. Citrusy flavors of pith and skin are skillfully wedded to ripe, substantial apricot and melon fruit, with none of the bitterness this grape can sometimes display. The purity is impressive.",US-Oregon-Viognier
"No need to cellar this Cab. It's so rich and ripe, it's easy to drink now despite some firm tannins. Showy and flashy, it has raspberry, cherry and blueberry flavors, with a jacket of smoky oak. Nevertheless, it will take 5–6 years of aging.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The upside of the recession is that wines this good are being sold for lower prices, which is great news for consumers. This Cabernet, basically a négociant's blend, is really delicious. It's rich, dry, tannic and lush in blackberry and cherry tart, chocolate and smoky cedar flavors.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"There is deliciously pure fruit here, rich certainly but with a straight line to pear, sweet orange and peach flavors. Behind the fruity exterior is a more structured core, showing spice as well as density and final acidity. Age for three years and more.",Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
"An attractively fruity wine—fragrant, fresh and with a touch of tannin. Raspberry flavors give the wine a good lift. Drink it this year.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"A bit rough in texture and light in body, but offers a nice, silky texture and some ripe flavors of cherries, cola and spices.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Pointy cherry aromas initially suggest nail polish and volatility. A gritty palate with candied red-fruit flavors seems generic, while berry, chocolate and marshmallow flavors lend sweetness to the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A big, ripe and juicy wine packed with black fruit notes and laced with acidity. The tannins offer a contrast to the fruitiness, bringing balance and structure. This is an impressive wine, the smoky aftertaste bringing out the wood aging.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Stewed prune marinated in spirits, coconut, espresso and grilled herb aromas unfold in the glass. The firm palate offers dark cherry, coffee, anise and tobacco alongside bracing tannins bright acidity. Best after 2019.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Bright and crisp, this bright sparkler has aromas of lime and apple that follow through to the lively palate. Vibrant acidity gives it a refreshing finish.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
Exotic streaks of licorice and cinnamon spice bolster this full-bodied forward Cabernet Franc. Ripe blackberry and cherry flavors are approachable and plump yet elegantly anchored by fine firm tannins and brisk acidity. It's ready to drink now but should hold well through 2020.,US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"This medium-bodied white delivers mature pear, yellow apple and white peach aromas and flavors. It's riper and rounder than usual but also boasts terrific freshness and elegance for the hot vintage.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Bianco
"The partner label of Black Cordon, also made by consulting winemaker Paul Hobbs, this entry-level offering blends small amounts of all the red Bordeaux varieties and ages in 80% new French oak. Tar and graphite scents and bold, soft acidity support juicy black and red berry flavors, with a shock of anise. Best enjoyed 2023 through 2033.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Not very expressive, it opens with subdued aromas that recall lemon peel and toast. These carry over to the palate along with a note of butterscotch. There's not enough fruit richness to support the racy acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon Blanc
"There's an attractive aromatic element in the form of spice, leather, warm toast, lead pencil and granite. But there's little red fruit here and the wine tastes lean and slightly gritty on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Pretty cherry fruit is at the center here, with light scents of fresh cut tobacco. The blend is two thirds Syrah, one third Cabernet Sauvignon, balanced and highlighted by a streak of cinnamon toast.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Made from the Turbiana grape, this conveys aromas of jasmine, honeysuckle and citrus with a whiff of walnut. The palate offers juicy nectarine, kiwi and lemon zest accented by a hint of almond.",Italy-Lombardy-Turbiana

"Yellowing in color and smelling waxy and peachy. This has become fleshy and sweet, with a syrupy feel. Drink it now or wait for a fresher vintage.",Argentina-Other-Torrontés
"Dense and powerful, this is an impressively concentrated and intense wine. It brings out rich tannins, equally rich black plum and spice flavors, a layer of smokiness plus a strong slash of minerality that cuts across the texture. For aging 5–6 years.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This 100% varietal wine is appealing with aromas of coffee, toasty barrel spices, berry and red fruit. It displays good richness and depth, offering plenty of pleasure now but clearly keeping an eye on the future. Best after 2018.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Sharp and minty, with modest red cherry and cola flavors. The thinness of fruit accentuates the tannins and acids. Nice and dry, but lacks generosity for a pricey Pinot Noir.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This crisp and snappy wine shows varietal characteristics of stone fruit, cut grass and pear, backed by a full and generous mouthfeel that speaks of the warm Tuscan sun. Pair this with assorted Chinese dim sum.",Italy-Tuscany-Vermentino
"Impressive wine, perfectly balancing its tannins and its stylish medicinal and herbal fruit flavors. It's juicy, with mouthfilling black currant flavors. A wine to age for several years, but likely to be drinkable, with softer tannins, in 2012.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"This wine demonstrates Viognier's exotic side, with flavors of tropical fruit, tangerine, white flower, vanilla, honey and spice. Despite the richness, it's dry and the acidity is mouthwatering. Don't serve this too cold, and pair it with Asian fare that's slightly sweet.",US-California-Viognier
"With its off-dry tango of sweet, tart and mineral components, this is a standout among a large range of Rieslings from Chehalem. Apple and white peach, citrus oil and wet stone are in play, with some grippy tannins adding a taste of orange pekoe tea. The residual sugar, listed at 16 g/L, is off-set with balancing acidity.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"This wine is a blend of Malbec (69%) and Syrah. Aromas of plum and spice lead to a plump, flavorful palate full of fruit flavors.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Scents of oak, toast, bread crust and vanilla follow through to the lean palate along with bitter walnut and a hint of butterscotch. Sharp, vigorous bubbles provide the backdrop.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sparkling Blend
"Made completely from Merlot, this wine comes from Candy Mountain (52%), Birch Creek (25%) and Bacchus vineyards. The oak (35% new American) plays a central role, with aromas of vanilla and green wood out in front of raspberries and cherries. Flavors are light yet concentrated, with the tannins showing some astringency.",US-Washington-Merlot
"This rich, thick, soft wine has Concord grape jelly and smoky oak aromas, with sweet blackberry flavors and a touch of tannin in the texture.",US-California-Red Blend
"A compelling blend of 40% Grenache, 40% Mourvèdre and 20% Syrah, this wine captures your attention from the first sniff.

It fills the mouth with wild and arresting flavors, sweet cherry fruit, animal, loam, cut tobacco and coffee grounds, all folding into dense, dark tannins.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"A potent Mencía with concentrated berry aromas along with intense oak, rubber and graphite notes.

Toasty and black on the finish; top-shelf Bierzo to drink now through 2015.",Spain-Northern Spain-Mencía
"This wine shows tremendous minerality for a wine from a mix of parcels. Almost smoky, saline mineral aromas combine with crisp, citrusy fruit to typify the Pfalz dry Riesling style. Picks up hints of orange and clove on the finish, with a suggestion of citrus pith.",Germany-Pfalz-Riesling
"Leathery and earthy, with hints of cranberries and chocolate. It's medium bodied and supple enough to drink now, turning a bit tart on the finish.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Aromas of toast, walnut and dried orchard fruit lead the nose on this blend of 40% Vermentino, 40% Sauvignon and 20% Chardonnay. The palate offers yellow apple skin, oak extract, butterscotch and toasted almond but it's shy on fruit richness.",Italy-Tuscany-White Blend

"Dark, viscous and monumental, this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend detonates on the palate with black currants, chocolate and cedar concentration, wrapped into the most perfect tannins. Outstanding, and should age for many years. Only 277 cases of this wine, which was grown on steep hillsides, were produced.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This Zinfandel is bone-dry and classically varietal, with briary, wild berry, black currant, mocha, raisin and peppery spice flavors. But consumers should understand that the alcohol is 16.7%. It's a great example of a superripe Sonoma Zin, but be careful to not drink too much.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This captures the essential flavors of Washington Sauvignon Blanc. There are no aggressive grassy-herbal flavors, none of the vegetal or canned pea flavors that show up in other New World Sauv Blancs. Here it's all about clean melon and yellow fruit flavors, backed with bracing natural acids, round and ripe.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc

"One of Jolivet's single-vineyard wines, this comes from a south-facing parcel in the heartland of Sancerre. It is a classic fruity wine, but is developing an opulent character that brings in spice as well as wonderfully ripe flavors. The wine is very drinkable now, although still young and with a great future. Drink ideally from 2018.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Despite some initially offputting scents of sweaty socks, this is a charming wine. Apple, citrus and petrol mingle easily once the difficult aromas have dissipated to reveal a medium-bodied, off-dry wine. It's creamy-textured in the mouth, then turns crisp and minerally on the finish.",Germany-Mosel-Saar-Ruwer-Riesling
"Pretty, delicate and soft, initial scents of redcherry and strawberry carry through to the lightweight easygoing plate. It's fresh and easy to like, with good zip to the finish.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rosé
"Very light and slightly sweet in style, this low-alcohol bottling offers stone fruit, lemon juice and peels, and the slightest hint of petrol on the honeyed nose. Exceedingly bright and crisp on the palate, the peachy sweetness is cut by a nearly bubbly acidity. It would be great for pool parties.",US-California-Riesling

"From the new, négociant side of Domaine Jessiaume, now owned by Scottish businessman Sir David Murray. The wine hints at the grandeur possible from Clos de Vougeot without quite achieving it.

The vineyard is on the flat plain of Saint-Émilion that leads to the river Dordogne. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"An interesting, crisp and bone-dry Chardonnay that succeeds in offering plenty of complexity despite the absence of any oak influence. The flavors carry the load, with intense notes of apricots, Meyer lemons and guavas, and a wonderful minerality—like a lick of cold steel.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This wine has certainly been wood aged, the easy fruit well balanced with the layers of wood tannin, which come through in the aftertaste. Ripe, ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Pure blackberry and cherry flavors shine in this pristinely fruity yet nuanced red. Unoaked, unfiltered and unrefined, it's a fascinating glimpse into Finger Lakes Cabernet Franc without makeup or adjustment. Crisp, cranberry acidity is sharp and penetrating on the midpalate, accentuating a long finish marked by subtle tones of green herb and tobacco leaf.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"This concentrated Barolo opens with aromas of violet, plum, subtle oak and menthol. The dense palate delivers crushed black cherry and raspberry layered with milk chocolate, coffee, clove and white pepper alongside fresh acidity and bracing tannins. Drink 2018–2038.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"From the former castle of the Counts of Provence, this is an intensely fruity wine, full of strawberry, orange zest and light spice. It is fragrant, fresh wine, lifted attractively at the end  with bright acidity.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Sweet strawberry and cherry fruits are the soft cover to this intensely tannic wine. That structure shows its power, concentration and ageworthiness. Keep for three years and the richness will be fully revealed.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Aromas of fresh, savory herbs are in the lead, followed by plum, vanilla and dark fruit. The black-fruit flavors are elegant with a firm squeeze of tannins backing them up. It needs time to come together but has all the stuffing.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"One of the best Merlot values on the market. With rich, delicious cherry, anise and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into softly smooth tannins, it's just what a California Merlot should be. Easy to find, with 10,000 cases produced.",US-California-Merlot
"Soft, fruity and simple, with blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors. Basically dry, but tastes as sweet as jam. Syrah, Cabernet and Mourvèdre.",US-California-Red Blend
"Creamy, almost powdery pear flavors dominate, but the palate is illuminated by bright, sprightly lemon acidity. There is an innate balance that can be summed up as creamy lemon on a dry, yeasty background. This is moreish, appetizing and has a lasting, fruity finish.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"An eccentric Chardonnay, although it's well made and has intellectual appeal. Bone dry and acidic, this has intense flavors of apricots, pineapples and honey. It should age for up to 8 years, gradually losing fruit and gaining earthy, minerally qualities.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Lush and concentrated in texture, this vineyard-designate is bright and tart with a bite of crunchy tannin and a bouquet of rose and lavender lurking on the nose. Light bodied and ultimately balanced, it brightens on the palate with a whirl of blood orange that complements the cranberry, pomegranate and cherry cola.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Blended from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this sparkler is a little rough in texture, with candied orange, lemon and lime flavors. But it has good bubbles and a clean, elegant finish.",US-California-Sparkling Blend

"This is a soft, fruity blend of Roupeiro, Rabo de Ovelha and Fernão Pires. It is ripe, full of apple and crisp green fruits, shot through with acidity. Drink now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese White
"Big and black but also heavily charred and very oaky—we're talking bulldozer oak that leaves mostly resin and vanilla on the palate. Combine that with huge tannins and extract, and what should be pleasant and fruity becomes a stampede across the palate.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Syrah
"Camiana has been establishing a real track record with this bottling, and the 2008 is the best yet. It shows the intensity and purity of Howell Mountain fruit, bearing deep flavors of blackberries, blueberries, dark chocolate and currants, with big, firm tannins that are characteristic of the mountain. There's also a softness and a femininity that make the wine drinkable now, but it should easily develop over the next decade, at the very least.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine opens with stewed plum, used leather, vanilla and coconut aromas. The palate is evolved, offering prune, espresso and sage flavors, with close-grained tannins that leave an astringent finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This informal red wine is the kind of bottle you'll want to stash away in the kitchen for easy pairings with weekday family dinners. The bouquet presents red berry, almond and cola nuances.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"Fresh citrus has a tang of green apple on the nose. The palate colors this with an equally zesty dollop of grapefruit, but something riper, richer, almost of dried fruit, also swings in there. This is intriguing and fresh, zesty and taut, lip-smacking and moreish. I feel that this will give up its secrets with a little more bottle age, but it already is delicious now.",Austria-Kremstal-Riesling
"Here's a textbook Rosso that delivers clear and crisp fruit notes, with pretty nuances of wild berry, red rose and moist earth at the back. The wine feels crisp, lean and silky on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"This feels sharp and raw, with ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors, plus a streak of sweet, toasty oak. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Plum and berry aromas are straightforward, but also clean and nice. The palate on this wine from San Rafael is focused and orderly, with flavors of red fruits, spice and mild woody notes. Long lasting on the finish, with freshness and just a modicum of tannic bite.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"The 2015 harvest produced a bumper crop of excellent Bierzo wines, Baltos included. Aromas of black fruits and violets are full and floral, with a hint of nicely scented candle. There's balance to the palate along with toasty, blackened flavors of blackberry and spice. Toasty notes persist on a well-balanced finish. Drink this fairly dense and wholly delicious Mencía trough 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain-Mencía
"This pure expression of Sangiovese offers alluring aromas of ripe plum, blue flowers and baking spice. The straightforward palate delivers black cherry, licorice, toast, espresso and ground pepper alongside polished tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese

"This inky purple dessert wine delivers high-toned fruit flavors of blueberry, blackberry jam, cinnamon, mocha and vanilla. Chewy tannins offer support and close on a nutmeg note.",Italy-Central Italy-Sagrantino
"A wine that's had some time to find itself in bottle, this opens in a wildness of mountain tannin and dusty texture, grippy and dry on the palate. Cedar, tobacco and shy black fruit call out for braised red meat, with a structure that should hold up longer in the cellar if necessary.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The excellent Les Collines Vineyard usually delivers more depth of flavor than this, but a cool vintage may be the culprit. Very light berry flavors, a wash of cement-like mineral and earthy tannins with an herbal edge sum up the flavor profile.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a soft wine, ripe with lime and grapefruit flavors that are sweetened with juicy red apple. It's tangy as well, laced with orange zest and filled with steely acidity. It should age a few months, so drink from late 2015.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"The first Feral made by new winemaker, Peter Devison, continues a tradition of excellence. Natural yeasts and fermentation in neutral oak, combined with a superb vintage and world class vineyard, equal a gorgeous bottle of wine. Creamy, leesy, textural and deeply imbued with mineral-soaked citrus fruit, flesh and rind, this ultrarefreshing wine is a joy. Notes of cucumber and melon contribute further complexity through the long finish.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"Made in robust style, then blended with 11% Petite Sirah and smaller amounts of Syrah and Petit Verdot, this old vines wine is a juicy core of brick, tar, blackberry and smoked meat, with an undeniable girth of oak and tannin. It's well-made in a bigger, bolder package.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Aromas of toast, sawdust, raspberry jam and menthol lead the way. The firm palate offers cherry liqueur, espresso and a hint of licorice while close-grained tannins provide the framework.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This nonvintage rosé, modeled after a Bandol, is a blend of grapes and vintages, yet retains superb freshness and offers unusual complexity. Rich and tart, with a creamy strawberry core, it also shows sandalwood highlights and a hint of barrel toast.",US-Oregon-Rosé
"Oodles of black cherry and boysenberry fill the aromas and flavors of this bold but not-too-big wine. The rich, ripe fruit shows right away in the nose, and continues on the palate but gets reined in a bit (in a good way) by a firm texture created by good acidity and tannins.",US-California-Primitivo
"Quite an unusual specimen in that you don't often see Monastrell mixed with Cabernet and Shiraz. The end result is fairly strange and unfamiliar; the nose smells saucy and lean, while the palate is also saucy and a touch medicinal.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"Waxy aromas suggest haystack and dusty apple. This is on the borderline of heavy and cloying in the mouth, while oak is the main driver of the flavor profile. On the finish, notes of melon and banana are covered by a resiny oak flavor.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"Here's a Barolo that lives up to its “riserva” status thanks to aged aromas of old spice, leather, black mineral, root beer, tar and menthol-like intensity. There are some earthy, dusty tones on the finish and the wine imparts firm, ripe tannins in the mouth. Riservas are usually aged one more year than base Barolos.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This unoaked, fruity wine is crisp, full of green fruits and lively acidity. It is light and bright, with a touch of Douro minerality to lift the texture. Drink now.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White

"Pure crushed blackberry exudes great charm on the nose and plays alongside toasty oak notes on the palate. Neither ripeness, nor juiciness, nor muscle allow for even one ounce of fat here. Toned and concentrated fruitiness, with soft tannins and bright acidity, result in an enticing wine.",Austria-Burgenland-Red Blend
"Both ripe fruit and tannins come through strongly in this wine. It's dense and richly layered, with black fruit and a firm texture. It shows fine potential now and is likely to age well. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Fresh, light and fruity this is attractive young Chablis. It is soft, dwelling on the fruit rather than any texture. Crisp and with citrus and green apple flavors, it will be ready to drink easily by mid-2016.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Highly enticing, handsome aromas of graphite, blueberry, boysenberry and oaky grit are firm and minerally. This lush, modern, stately Tempranillo is pure, plump and deep on the palate. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and fine oak come together like paint on Dalí's canvas, while the finish is loamy and complex, with flavors of tobacco folded into silky smooth depth. Drink through 2024",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This 100% Grenache cuvée displays charming and complex aromas of garrigue and ripe cherries and raspberries. It's lush and creamy in texture despite being vinified and aged in concrete. It's a touch warm on the finish, but delicious nonetheless. Drink now–2020.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Comes off as a slightly skinny Pinot Noir, with herbal overtones to the cherry and strawberry flavors. Still, it's varietally true, and light enough in body to pair effectively with chicken or salmon. Drink now.",Australia-Victoria-Pinot Noir
"Made from Howell Mountain and St. Helena fruit, this wine is rich and savory, with black currants and cassis, a tang of minerality and plenty of rich, toasted oak flavor. The finish is dry, but the tannins are quite strong. This 100% Cabernet needs serious time in the cellar; hold until 2018, and it could go for another decade.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The Arinto is a local grape as far as Lisboa is concerned, and this wine seems right at home here. Made from old vines, it is fresh, tangy and destined to be drunk young with locally-caught Atlantic Ocean fish. The wine has a pure, clean, perfumed aftertaste. Drink now.",Portugal-Lisboa-Arinto
"Expensive, yes, but this is a very great Cabernet, and the Sacrashe Vineyard repeatedly proves itself as one of the best in Rutherford, if not Napa Valley itself. The 100% Cabernet, which is a limited production barrel selection of only 420 cases, is so delicious in blackberry jam, chocolate, olive and cedar flavors, it's hard to not drain the bottle now. But it also shows fabulously rich tannins that suggest aging. May not be one for the long haul, but certainly great over the next six years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dense, dry and ripe, this is a Cabernet to lay down. It's really tough and gritty in tannins, but solid in wild blackberry, cherry and herb flavors. A powerful young Cabernet that needs 6–8 years to come around.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a rich blend of Aragonez and Touriga Nacional that fills out broad black fruit and acidity with soft tannins and a ripe texture. Rich and juicy, it's ready to drink.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"This big but well-behaved wine brings out the pure deliciousness of the grapes. It smells perfectly ripe without being sweet or jammy, feels very elegant and rich, and tastes like blackberry-boysenberry juice. It's just tannic enough for balance, and the polished fruitiness continues through the finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Intensely aromatic with notes of flowers and ripe tropical fruits, this is a lush, textured Gewurztraminer with massive power and brawn. Just off dry in style, it's surprisingly elegant for such a big-bodied wine, but with ample acidity. Nuances of tea leaves and potpourri linger on the finish.",US-New York-Gewürztraminer
"A gentle but flashy reserve-style Cabernet for drinking now. It's rich in blackberry jam, currants and anise, with touches of smoky oak. The acid-tannin structure gives it the refinement of an upscale Napa Cab.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Along with soft red fruits, this is a wine that shows crisp acidity, strawberry flavors and light tannins. It's already drinkable, but it can age for a year.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"A strong caramel aroma and flavor spoils the suggestions of fruit. They give a ripe, almost sweet character that doesn't match with the red-currant fruit flavors.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"Raspberries, cherries, cola and persimmons are the flavors of this fairly standard Pinot Noir. It's dry and delicately structured, with good acidity and a discrete coating of oak. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
Pressed apple and pear notes are brightened by a kiss of yellow cherries and lemon in this delicate wine. The palate has a pleasant roundness despite its light-bodied frame. The finish is brisk.,US-New York-Chardonnay
"This wine is still young, very fresh in its crisp acidity and lemon and grapefruit flavors. It has the potential to age well, with an underlay of tension between fruit and mineral texture. It is complex, structured and needs to mature further. Drink from 2018.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"A southern Rhône-style blend based on Mourvèdre, this blush wine is crisp and clean, with raspberry and spice flavors, but it's too sweet for a table wine.",US-California-Rosé
"Floral and funky, this combines 47% Syrah, 42% Malbec, 10% Cabernet Franc and 1% Viognier. Medium-strength, it's a rustic, dusty wine with notes of blackberry, blueberry and a touch of dried herb.",US-California-Red Blend

"Stone fruit and honeysuckle aromas lead the nose while the simple off-dry palate doles out green apple, peach and candied citrus peel. It's fresh and informal, with bright acidity.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"A little mealy on the nose, with apple and melon aromas poking through. The palate is both pithy and sharp, with citric acids providing the basis for grapefruit and orange flavors. Pithy on the finish, with passionfruit notes.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"Staunch aromas of leather and animal hide ride heavily on top of rubbery blackberry scents. This feels solid but scattered, with cherry and cassis flavors that come across jammy. Rubbery notes and a mild cheesy oak character dominate the finish.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"Smooth and round, this wine has bright acidity, tempered by the toast and sweet apricot flavors. It has a structured core, and it finishes with the acidity. Age this for 2–3 years.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"It's not often that you see Charbono in a Cabernet bottling, but it works. This wine boasts aromas of ripe cassis, red cherry and woody chocolate. The tannins are pronounced and chalky, giving a full mouthfeel, with sharp flavors of tart cherry and a strong acidity.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is mostly Grenache, with about one-third Syrah blended in. There are pleasant cherry and blackberry flavors on the palate, but also a mushroomy streak that distracts. It's not likely to improve with age so drink up.",US-California-Grenache-Syrah
"Full bodied and richly textured, this is a generous wine, resplendent in tangy caramel apple and wild vanilla. Soft on the palate, it leans tropical, with a taste of pineapple, guava and even coconut, plus a slight suggestion of nutmeg-like spice at the end.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Whiffs of smoke and dark-roast coffee meander pleasantly amid crisp red cherry and berry flavors in this brisk but full-bodied red blend. The palate is lean but elegantly concentrated, finishing on a refreshingly herbal tone.",US-New York-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The wine is rich, bringing together two great white grapes. Both give the ripe smooth texture, while the Alvarinho also brings in its crisper charms. Pear and green-plum flavors dominate this intense and concentrated wine. Drink from late 2017.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese White
"Tastes soft and a little tired at the age of six-plus years, with pie-filling raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. A certain dry complexity makes it interesting, but its lifespan is largely exhausted.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Jammy raspberry and plum aromas come with accents of dusty herbs and black licorice. A saturated, lush, jammy palate features soft, baked flavors of cassis and wild berry, while the finish delivers mint, chocolate and lasting berry ripeness. Drink through 2019.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This beauty of a sweet wine has a perfume like jasmine and honeysuckle blossoms and flavors like Anjou pears and lychees. It's very ripe, succulent and almost thick on the palate, but far from simply syrupy. The exotic flavors expand with each sip, and linger a long time on the finish.",US-California-Muscat Canelli
"Sàgana shows its best qualities in the 2008 vintage. It opens with a dark, inky appearance and thick aromas of red cherry, chocolate, espresso bean and dark spice. It's a bold and concentrated wine, with savory endnotes of soy and Teriyaki sauce.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola

It opens with lovely scents of violet, rose, perfumed berry and balsamic aromas while the radiant, almost ethereal palate delivers crunchy red cherry, strawberry, white pepper and mineral intensity.

"This is a big Chardonnay that's oaky and ripe with fruit. Flavors of cream, lees, toast, Mandarin oranges, apricots and stewed peaches all mingle together in a spicy, complex and dry wine. Four additional years in the cellar will allow it to integrate beautifully.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A soft, fleshy wine to drink now. It has a fancy mouthfeel, with a firm hit of tannins and acidity, and lush flavors of blackberries, cherries, cola and spices.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This weakly constituted Cabernet opens with raisiny aromas. Those are backed by a chunky, low-acid palate with raisin and baked plum flavors. The finish tastes baked and feels rubbery.",Chile-Maule Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Stalky, lemony, rooty berry aromas set up a grabby palate with lightly earthy plum and berry flavors. Woody, earthy and drying on the finish. Overall, this is a basic Rioja with cool-vintage characteristics.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo

"From parcels of old vines in the Côte des Blancs, this limited-edition wine is a beautiful Chardonnay. It is finely woven, tightly textured and crisp in apple skin and lemon notes. Concentration from the low-yielding vines gives great depth and the potential to still age well. Drink this exceptional wine from 2017.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay

"There is a touch of smoke and stone that lends a darker aspect to the ripe but crisp apple fruit. The palate has that same taut but very full-fruited feel—of very tightly held ample fruit reminiscent of red-cheeked, aromatic apples. This is both powerful and svelte. The palate is dry and finishes very clean, leaving you with haunting apple notes and fresh lemon.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Brian Croser's efforts with Tiers Vineyard Chardonnay have finally paid off in a big way. This is a plump, amply textured wine that doesn't lack for elegance, marrying scents and flavors of toasted grain with white peaches and hazelnuts. Long and intense on the finish, echoing with toasty oak but also layers of vibrant fruit. Drink now–2015.",Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"Despite some tough tannins on the finish, this is an intriguingly complex wine that may prove even better than this rating suggests. It starts with a garrigue note and a hint of tapenade, then adds bright cherry fruit and plenty of dusty tannins. Drink 2014–2020.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
An immediately approachable tawny that has kept so much fruit while also bringing in the old wood aging flavors that give these wine so much fine character. It has bitter orange marmalade fruit and great acidity at the end. It is ready to drink.,Portugal-Port-Port
"The nose is limited and narrow, not fruity or tropical as it should be. A plump, soft palate is low on pulse, while lychee and honeydew flavors end bland and slightly bitter.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Torrontés
"Solid wine, dark, firm and powerful. The black currant fruits shear through the tannic texture, giving a wine that is juicy, fresh, structured and definitely for aging.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"You'll find light scents of apple, pear and a dose of wet rock on this brisk white that carry over to the rather raw palate. Racy acidity gives it a nervy edge.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Spiced, baked apple constitutes the main aroma on nose and palate: ripe but tart baked fruit scented with edges of cinnamon and citrus. This brims with fruit and lemony brightness on a citrus-focussed, dry palate of concentration and earthy poise. Lasting and delicious. Drink 2016–2020.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Sourced again from the excellent Far Away vineyard, this pure varietal Mourvèdre shows lovely, fruit-driven aromas of baked cherry, plum and apple. It's round and detailed on the palate, with highlights of cinnamon, cardamom, and pepper.",US-Washington-Mourvèdre

"For a big-production wine (33,000 cases) with just 12 months of barrel aging, this is impressive. Sweet but balanced dark fruit and cola aromas are nice, while the palate is forward and tastes of blackberry and cola. Complex and slightly gritty and tannic on the finish, which indicates that it has the structure to age. Drink now through 2013.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Tense and firmly tannic, this wine is still very young. Berry and black currant fruit are still dominated by a dry character. The wine will take time toward its slow maturity.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Ripe and generous, this floral wine is dense with fruit as much as tannins. It is full of blackberry and plum flavors, ripe while also cut with acidity. The spice that comes from the wood aging shows well, adding a further element. Drink the wine from 2022.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir

"This is a gorgeous wine with impressive intensity and balance. Aromas include black cherry, dried currants, candied fruit, leather, tar and a touch of powdered licorice. There are earthy and mineral tones as well and the wine shows the high levels of richness and complexity that can be achieved with Sangiovese Grosso.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso

"Quite spicy in the nose, with hints of pretty cedar, anise and herb flavors up front. Zippy acidity blends well with creamy smooth tannins, all framing a complex web of chocolate, raspberry, cassis, blackberry, licorice and earth flavors. A slight citrus edge gives lift at the end. Long on the finish; a fine first effort from this new winery. -J.M.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A first vintage Port for José Maria Soares Franco, the man behind the legendary Douro table wine Barca Velha. He has teamed up with J. Portugal Ramos, better known in the Alentejo. This is beautifully perfumed Touriga Nacional, followed by fine and ripe tannins. A layer of acidity gives the wine a more dry, serious side. Powerful and intended for aging.",Portugal-Port-Port
"A sensuous sweet Sherry, this has the full monty of fig, date, licorice, root beer and chocolate aromas and flavors. It's naturally thick and sweet but also balanced, so it doesn't come across like a spoonful of syrup. Great as a dessert wine with cake or blue cheese, but also as a topping for vanilla or coffee ice cream.",Spain-Andalucia-Pedro Ximénez
"The wine leads off with aromas of oak, espresso, black currant, blue flower and a hint of vanilla extract. The palate offers ripe—nearly overripe—black cherry, cinnamon and spice.

"This has appealing flavors of tropical fruit, orange, peach and vanilla, with a creamy texture and an overall sense of elegance. The acidity is brisk and clean.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Silex is a flint and sand soil that suits Sauvignon Blanc well. This wine, with tight, nervy texture and crisp lemon character, is still fresh, full of primary citrus and gooseberry flavors. It needs until 2015 to fully integrate and show rich concentration.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This perfumed wine offers good balance between citrus and warmer fruits. Peach and apple come together easily with the lemon flavors. The wine has a bright, tight mineral edge and is ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"The power of smoky oak shows strongly on this wine. Black-cherry fruit aromas are woven in with caramel, fudge, vanilla and cappuccino scents.

"Made in a complex style rather than simply fruity, this smells like toasted almonds and vanilla bean. Tastes suggest not-quite-sweet Bosc pears, butter and walnuts. While the texture is luxurious the body is actually light, and the wine is not at all cloying.",US-California-Viognier
"Marchesale is an excellent Syrah with an inky, black appearance and intense aromas of blueberry, plum, prune, black pepper and crushed stone. The wine shows incredible richness and density and lasts long on the palate thanks to its firm, succulent tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Syrah
"Tastes strong and distinctive, with well-etched white pepper, black raspberry, tobacco and herb flavors. This earthy wine feels silky smooth on the palate, with crisp acids, but is a little one-dimensional for the price.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a lovely Cabernet Sauvignon that's drinking well now, although it's certainly tannic. It should hold well through the next 6 years. Dry and balanced, it shows classic flavors of blackberries and black currants, with earthier notes of olive tapenade and carob.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dark ruby in color, this wine offers raspberry and strawberry aromas. It's bright on entry, with a network of tannins that slowly emerge amidst black cherry, black currant, juniper and tomato leaf flavors. The zippy finish is marked by a splash of clementine flavor.",Israel-Galilee-Shiraz
"A nice Chardonnay that shows ripe pineapple, green apple and pear flavors, with added smoky richness from oak, and the finish is dry and crisp. A good price for a wine of this quality.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Here's a complex and sophisticated sparkler with beautiful aromas of stone fruit, freshly baked bread, pressed flowers and crushed white pepper. The wine tastes rich and thick in the mouth and ends with piquant effervescence.",Italy-Lombardy-Sparkling Blend

"Lavish aromas of black cherry, blackberry jam, gingerbread, mincemeat pie and caramel chews combine for a hedonistic nose on this wine from Aaron Jackson. Dense, dark blueberry fruit drives the palate, which gains complexity from espresso beans, dark chocolate and graphite minerality.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"This wine is a unique in the state blend and features Cinsault (35%), Grenache (35%) and Mourvèdre.

It's a perfect summer wine.",US-Washington-Rosé

"This intoxicates with berry pie and coffee notes. It's a soft, elegant and restrained Zinfandel, with savory curves from beginning to end.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Winemaker: Teddy Hall. Ripe, brambly scents of raspberry and cherry lead the bouquet of his plush and friendly wine. Notes of black pepper and game lend additional depth, while fine yet structured tannins provide good grip and length to the finish. Glimmers of chocolate-covered cherry, baking spice and char grace the close. Drink now–2020.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Shiraz
"Light and silky, this packs a real punch in complexity, with layers of raspberry, cherry, cola and sweet oak. There's a mushroom-driven earthiness you might call Burgundian. The tightness suggests aging, possibly over the long haul.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"The color goes from medium garnet in the middle to a light brownish on the rim. It smells like dried cherry, sage and toast, and tastes substantially fruity. The wine feels just structured enough by acidity and tannin for balance.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"So bright and zingy in acidity, and so ripe in tangerine, mango, lime fruit and honeysuckle, that you hardly notice the oak influence. Yet, it's there in the form of buttered toast. The result is a big, powerful Chardonnay, clean and vibrant, for drinking now with dramatic shellfish and pork dishes.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Pungent grassy notes lead the nose of this bottling from Vina Robles, with rounder passionfruit scents as well. The palate combines flinty minerality with lime zest, kumquat and herbal flavors, recalling its initial grassiness.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Pale and crisp, this has yeast and herb flavors, with a creamy character from the mousse. Light and just off-dry, this would make for a fine apéritif.",France-France Other-Sparkling Blend
"With strong fruity aromas like lemon and lime, this wine starts off bold and then turns more mellow and smooth on the palate. It has light vanilla accents and a creamy texture.",US-California-Chardonnay

"The wine at this stage is all tannin. But you can feel the weight of red fruits underneath. It will develop as a serious wine, packed with both fruit and structure. Strongly mineral and with a dark texture, it has considerable aging potential. Drink from 2016.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Round and fruity with fully ripe, even sweet flavors of pear and honeydew melon. It's a little yeasty also, with a somewhat beery finish. But overall it's a fine bottle for simple sipping.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris

"This 14.5% bruiser contains 20% Viognier, which adds a tropical fruit character to the nose and palate. The mouthfeel is soft, with flavors heavy on banana and melon. Woody characteristics such as nuttiness, particularly almonds, also pop up. To its detriment, the oak and fruit seem to be fighting each other more than complementing one another.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Don Tommaso is a plump, rich expression of Chianti Classico with cherry and blackberry backed by green aromas of curry leaf or rosemary. The wine's texture is smooth, consistent and soft.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A very good wine, although a very young one that needs time. It's not because the tannins are hard, because they're not. But the primary blackberry and cherry flavors haven't married with the oak, despite the wine being more than three years of age. The grapes come from a tenderloin of the appellation that's known for quality. Best after 2009.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Most of this Sauvignon Blanc was tank fermented, but a portion received oak. That gives a welcome layer of smoky richness and vanilla to the beautiful, underlying Meyer lemon, lime, pear and green apple flavors that are so rich and mouthwateringly tart. A very drinkable, dry white wine.",US-California-Fumé Blanc
"Focused flavors of mint and black currant come together in this distinctive Cabernet. There's a touch of oak too that adds spice, and the overall character is elegant. The wine will benefit from some aging to further integrate its parts.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Opens with spice notes of cinnamon and anise before transitioning to fuller cherry and plum flavors. The mouthfeel is warm and fatty, while the finish still holds some buttery notes and tannic grip. Nothing spectacular but not bad for a 1999 wine from Valdepeñas.",Spain-Central Spain-Tempranillo
"This is finished dry, at 13.3% alcohol, and puts the emphasis on citrus and grass, cracker and grain. There is a smidgeon of varietal perfume—a whiff of rose petal—but overall it's trending more toward Sauvignon Blanc than most Gewürztraminer. Nonetheless there is an impression of sweetness on the palate, from the nicely-ripened fruit.",US-Oregon-Gewürztraminer
"Despite ruddy, ripe raspberry and strawberry flavors, there's a leanness to this tart, savory dry rosé. Savory layers of bramble and herb are prominent on the midpalate.",US-New York-Rosé
"A near copy of the 2006. Fruity and direct, with candied flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, cola, chocolate and pepper. Now–2012.",US-California-Petite Sirah

"Chardonnay fans will like the pineapple and pear flavors, with their creamy, spicy edge of vanilla and pepper spice. It's a direct, dry wine at a pretty good price.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a new wine from these enterprising négociants. Fruity, crisp and light, it has a tangy orange zest texture that gives extra brightness. Very fresh and ready to drink.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Sweet cream, butterscotch and vanilla flavors give this wine immediate appeal. Fortunately, it also has a good core of lemons, limes and tropical fruits. The richness is balanced with crisp acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a darkly fruity and spicy wine from a site overlooking the Marin Coastal range, often shrouded in fog. Planted to five clones, the site provides plenty of cardamom, clove, forest floor and black tea while allowing for a wildness of plum tart and crusty bread. The oak imprint is light.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine is solid, concentrated and tannic, and it has a dark chocolate flavor from having aged in wood. It's likely to develop into a chunky wine over the next few years.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Smells oily, stemmy and a bit funky, while the palate is sweet in the extra dry mold, with candied white-fruit, vanilla and powdered sugar flavors. The finish is warm and sweet, with a fast fade. More candied and sweet than fruity or exact.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
Intriguing and enticing aromas of honey and toasted peanuts lead to very sweet but mild fruit flavors and a texture so soft and billowy that the wine seems to vaporize on the palate. This will be great to drink after dinner or with a selection of cheeses.,US-California-Roussanne
"This blend has 80% Viognier, which adds a peach and apricot streak that adds interest to the lemony, grapefruity flavors. Drinks tart, bone dry and clean, with sleek acidity. A terrific, elegant wine, perfect for a first course, and a great offering from this top producer. Editors' Choice.",US-California-White Blend

"Mild citrus and stone-fruit aromas include a note of crushed vitamin. This bright-pink rosé is wide but citric on the palate, with mild nectarine and white-grape flavors. On the finish, this is round in feel without much flavor.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"A rich, smooth wine that wears its ripeness and opulence with grace. The structure is all there, a dry center that supports the blackberry jelly and sweet fruits, as well as acidity, a vivid freshness that acts as a foil to all the rich, meaty flavors.",Portugal-Alentejo-Portuguese Red
"Pretty pear, apple and other dusty white-fruit aromas start this cleansing cava on its way to pure citrus, Granny Smith apple and lime flavors. It has a mildly linear, angular feel but it doesn't come across sheer or sour; to the contrary, it's balanced and generous with its fruit.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Tight, light and layered in freshly baked bread and firm cherry and cranberry, this is a soft, rounded Pinot from an inland Sonoma Coast site that's balanced, food-friendly and ready to enjoy now through 2016.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Similar to the winery's regular Pinot Noir, this is moving quickly along the aging curve. Hints of strawberry fruit are cloaked in barrel flavors of mocha and cracker. Drink soon.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Les Collines and Stone Valley fruit make up 75% of this wine with the rest coming from Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge and Summit View. It offers generous aromas of blueberry puree, dried herbs, red fruit, woodspice, dried flowers and mineral. The flavors bring the same but are more pulled-back than the aromas suggest, with a bit of astringency that holds the wine back.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This is harder than the 2008, which was released at the same time, but it shows real Napa elegance. The tannic toughness tells you to decant it for a few hours, which makes the blackberry and cassis flavors become more expressive.",US-California-Red Blend
"A rich, decadent and generous wine, 100% varietal, this is both floral and fruity, bright in cherry and raspberry alongside herbal cedar and vanilla. A medium weight surrounds softly integrated tannins, leading the way to an explosive, juicy finish. This is a classic example of the appellation's prowess in approachable power.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Here a fun, fresh and bright Barbera (aged in large oak casks) that shows good integrity of fruit and an easy, informal personality. Pair this wine with risotto cooked with cream of asparagus.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera

"Rich and complex, this Cab shows deep black fruit flavors of blackberry and cassis framed by decadent notes of espresso, leather and peppery spice. Like crushed satin in the mouth with ample tannins and a lush fleshy fruit backbone. Accents of menthol appear on the lengthy finish. Drink now.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dark, spicy and deeply flavored, this Cabernet is dense and concentrated in blackberry and cassis flavors, with a stony minerality at its core. The fruit is so ripely expansive, it tastes sweet on the finish, yet the wine is utterly dry. It's good now despite the hard mountain tannins, but should begin to blossom after 2014.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Minerally, slightly dusty apple aromas lead into a well-balanced palate with body and zesty acidity. Peach, green melon and white-pepper flavors fade out on a pulpy finish with good acidic cut.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo

"The 2006 Chardonnay is another excellent bottle from this Oregon négociant, offering ripe and luscious fruit flavors of pear, apple, quince and kiwi.

Drink now through 2012.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo

"Leaving Bordeaux for the Médoc, this is the first estate along the road. The wine is structured and firm, with some solid tannins as well as generous blackberry fruit. The wood aging and spice balance the blueberry and blackberry fruits. The wine should age well; drink from 2021.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This opens with vibrant aromas of green olive, herbs and fresh asparagus along with dark cherry. Not shy, the full-bodied, tightly wound flavors bring a core of dark fruit and savory flavors that persist on the finish.",US-Washington-Syrah

"The nose on this bottling is very smoky and flinty, but also shows underlying pear and apple aromas. There's an intriguing lime-zest character to the palate, with a base of dried apples and a smoked-wood character that's hard to ignore.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A product of the cool 2010 vintage, this has a green, minty flavor, with notes of lemon and lime. It's not the richest wine, but with its bright, mouthwatering acidity it should be nice a cocktail sipper, and should pair well with spicy Asian fare.",US-California-Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc
"Blackberry jam aromas are followed by fleshy and full dark-fruit flavors, surrounded by a layer of fine grained tannins. It provides a lot of quality and value.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This has big red berry flavors along with intense acidity topped by the dark, dry tannic structure. It will need some aging, so drink from 2017.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Taut citrus, cleansing lemon and brisk grapefruit show an uncompromsing, dry Riesling that majors in tense citrus and wet-stone flavors. There is a linearity and a very alluring purity that deserves to develop further. This is lovely and briskly refreshing now, but time in bottle will bring out more earthy, stony complexity. Drink 2017–2025.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Pretty red roses and a red-cherry element mix with crushed pencils, sandalwood and strawberry jam on this wine's light, bright but underlyingly rich nose. The baked strawberry carries into the palate, lifted by hibiscus, lavender, white sage and potpourri flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Ripe and lusty, this is earthy and foresty on the nose, with plenty of oak, olive, eucalyptus and graphite. The palate is saturated almost to the point of being too heavy, but that only means that lush, penetrating, herbal blackberry and cola flavors have a stout base to work with. A toasted finish with some bitterness closes this out. Drink through 2019.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"Brooding, very varietal aromas of grass, herbs and citrus lead to broad fruit flavors that dip in the middle, with some reduction providing a bit of distraction. It doesn't quite stand up on its own but should perk up at the dinner table.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"Oily, salinic aromas of match stick and pickled white fruits offer up a pinched palate with briny, stalky flavors of burnt orange and passion fruit. A briny tasting, clampy finish doesn't do much to bring this around.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Less flamboyant than the 2010, this is still an excellent wine. It's full bodied, rich and broad on the palate, delivering layers of honeyed apricot and citrus that finish warm, with a hint of caramel. Drink it over the next couple of years.",France-Rhône Valley-Viognier
"Mineral, citrus and dusty aromas are textbook for brut Cava. A round, full palate shows good grip and acidity, while flavors of lemon-lime and nectarine finish with notes of lime and green banana. Nothing about this is overwhelming, but the sum of its parts add up.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Big and rich, front-loaded with blackberry and cherry jam fruit. The tannins are considerable, giving the wine a full-bodied mouthfeel, like Grenache. Delicious, but a bit ponderous now for a Pinot Noir. Give it a few years in the cellar to mellow.",US-California-Pinot Noir

Drink from 2017–2030.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro
"The winemaking has a slightly Australian flavor, aging primarily in American oak and going into barrel while still fermenting, resulting in a fairly soft wine with good intensity and varietal character. Some slightly smoky, earthy notes and cured meat aromas give way to blackberry and cola flavors on the palate, finishing up with a hint of coffee. Drink now–2015.",US-California-Syrah
"Roccolo Grassi takes Valpolicella Superiore to the next level. While Valpolicella Superiore is mostly recognized as an easy-drinking red to wash down with pizza or pasta, this has touches of ripe fruit and exotic spice that lend extra sophistication, elegance and texture.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This is a true reserve, richer and more complex than Bargetto's regular Merlot. Shows dense flavors of black raspberries, currants, cherries, chocolate and vanilla, wrapped into firm but accessible tannins, and finishes thoroughly dry and spicy. Best now and for a year or two.",US-California-Merlot
"A strongly wood aged wine, powered by tannins and dense fruits, it is concentrated and still young enough for the wood to show through although the fruit is developing well. This is a structured wine that will need plenty of time to age so drink from 2018.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This seems as sweet as a fruit tart, featuring pineapple and orange jam flavors, with an oaky hit of buttered toast. Brisk acidity provides needed balance, but it's still pretty simple.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Simple and sweet, like a mango, pineapple and peach fruit juice blend. Not much going on, but will appeal to lots of Chard lovers at this price. Production was half a million cases.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Quite light in color, this wine—named after the 1890s regional pioneer Adolph Siot—brings light bubblegum, cut grass, apple and slightly funky reductive aromas. It's lively and acidic on the focused palate, carrying flavors of butter, apple skin and pear skin, with just enough of the fruity flesh attached to broaden the mouthfeel.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"Elegant and elevated, this shows fine integration of fruit and oak on the nose. It feels creamy, with barrel toast, dry spice and melon flavors. It is firm, healthy and structured on the finish courtesy of barrel fermentation and aging. A Burgundian facsimile from Rueda.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo

"This Zin speaks to compelling red fruit, plum and vanilla, with light oak presence. It's balanced yet still plenty big, showing off its well-worn roots within an historic vineyard. Before veering into syrupy territory, it pulls back, letting leathery cinnamon and black pepper have their say.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This is thin and tart, but it shows enough Chardonnay flavor, with simple fruit and smoked butter flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay

"A vibrant and lithe expression of cool-climate Syrah, this bottling shows crushed peppercorns, beef char, thyme, coffee syrup, potpourri and blackberry juice on the nose. The crisp palate is lively with peppery spice, with a base of tart elderberry juice layered with cooked lamb and fresh rosemary. It finishes with a healthy sense of pencil shavings.",US-California-Syrah
"Ripe black fruits combine with bitter chocolate and toast from the wood to give a very ripe wine. It is structured at this stage but is likely to ripen and round out over the next 3–4 years to give a rich, smooth, Merlot style.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"As usual for Casa Silva, this Carmenère is foreceful, minty, herbal and spunky on the nose, with a bold fruit aroma. The mouthfeel is robust and juicy, and the flavors run from herbal plum to berry to carob. The finish is herbal, with length and texture.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"The Attaché brings appealing and lively cherry fruit, framed with citrusy acidity. The power in this wine is all forward and fruit-driven. It's quite good, but more for immediate drinking than cellaring.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This red blend from Umbria offers a decadent bouquet that consists of rich chocolate and bright cherry intensity. The wine is smooth and chewy with a plush, velvety texture.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"This is a gorgeously perfumed Riesling, chock-full of white flowers and ripe, juicy stonefruit, but not at all cloying. Dry on the palate, it exhibits elegant peach and apricot flavors that lead to a long, lingering finish marked by lime peel and a hint of chalk.",US-New York-Riesling
"Based in the southern Champagne Aube region, this producer offers a reserve cuvée that is ripe and full of fruit, with tangy acidity and a crisp texture. It offers good balance between lime and apple fruits and a richer character that makes it a great apéritif style. This bottling is ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Previously lableled Quatre Journaux, this is now vineyard-designated, but otherwise everything remains unchanged. It's a pretty wine, with rhubarb and red-plum fruit. Further details of orange peel and chocolate emerge as it opens. The perfectly balanced acids and tannins suggest it will thrive in the cellar. Drink now–2006.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Smooth and textured, this wine is rich, floral, perfumed and full of ripe yellow and crisper green fruits. With a fine tang and shot of acidity, it is developing well, but needs more time. Drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine offers notes of peach, honeysuckle and lime leaf. It's sweet and lightly spritzy in feel, with lavender flavors on the finish.",US-Washington-Riesling
"This pitch-black Malbec opens with aromas of raisin, blackberry, cassis and vanilla. The palate exhibits a tight muscular grip, while flavors of mocha, chocolate, prune and cassis finish with complex hints of leather and salt. Drink this massive offering from 2018–2026.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Aromas of mature black plum and baking spices take center stage on this young red. The ripe palate offers graphite, licorice and red cherry but it's a bit limited on freshness so enjoy it soon with savory first courses like pasta topped with ragù.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This workhorse vineyard supplies grapes to a wide variety of wines across the entire Ste. Michelle portfolio, but the vineyard-designated wines are much more limited, and they're often the best of show. As the alcohol reaches 15.5%, this selection is sappy, dense and a bit warm. There's plenty of fruit flavor and concentration, but it's difficult to pair such a blockbuster with food.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dense and heavy, and maybe a touch dull on the nose in terms of fruit aromas. But once it hits the palate the wine shines with intense black fruit, sugar beet and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and warm, with saturation and texture. Almost over the edge as far as ripeness, but not quite. Drink now through 2012.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Full-bodied, creamy in texture and richly fruited, this is a fine example of Gigondas. Garrigue and black cherries mark the nose, picking up hints of chocolate on the long, silky finish. Drink now–2025.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"A solid and textured wine, Catapereiro Reserva is full-bodied and rich. With dark berry and ripe plum fruit characteristics, as well as firm tannins, it is a serious and complex wine that deserves aging. Drink from 2015.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
"This wine is made in decent quantities, enough to hopefully find, and that's good news, given its quality for the price. Juicy, spicy and just the right amount of herbal, it has sizzling acidity that livens and refreshens the palate, dotted in chocolate-covered cherry, plum and clove.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A whole universe of fresh flavors opens up: lime zest and kaffir lime leaves, green Seville orange peel and camphor. This is pure, straight-laced, unfussy and honest refreshment. As clear as a mountain spring and as bracing. That last lick of freshness will take you to a weightless citric heaven.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"This blend of Garnacha, Marsellan and Syrah opens with a dark, inky, smoky nose that's full of lemony oak along with black-fruit aromas. It's hard as nails on the palate, with drilling tannins. Rubbery, herbal blackberry flavors end with burnt toast, rubbery accents and a briny aftertaste. Best from 2017–2022.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"Green and earthy in the nose, with more vegetal aromas than fruity ones. The palate is tangy and also vegetal, while full tannins and some bitterness dominate the finish. Parts of this wine seem to be in shape while others are not. As a whole, it lacks ripeness and overt appeal.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Sprays of rose petals and violets mingle decadently with notes of brandy-soaked cherries on this deliciously juicy Pinot Noir. Dry, yet densely concentrated in fruit, its bright acidity carries towards a soft, candy-coated cherry finish.",US-New York-Pinot Noir
"Toasty, caramelized oak and sweet heat from high alcohol dominate this wine. The blackberry and cherry fruit flavors are very ripe. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

The soft, warm palate delivers juicy raspberry, crushed black cherry and baking spices alongside big, round tannins. It's extremely accessible so enjoy now. Petit Pois, Siena Imports.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese

Clean white-fruit aromas are fresh and dry. This brut Cava puts out citric notes on a palate with bright malic acidity. Lime and green-apple flavors finish fresh but without any shift towards complexity.,Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Pristine, primary tangerine and grapefruit flavors shine brilliantly throughout this crisp, light-footed Spätlese. It's dangerously quaffable, yet nuanced by shades of candlewax, mineral and saffron that extend the finish dramatically.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Almost indistinguishable from a Pinot Noir, this polished wine is light and silky and dry, with brisk acidity highlighting red cherry, red licorice, cola and mushroom flavors. Drink this fancy wine now.",US-California-Pinot Meunier
"There is an unctuous character to this bottling by iconoclastic cattleman-turned-vintner Jeffrey Blair, with hazelnut, apricot jam and mandarin orange on the nose. Almond oil shows on the palate, but then a rush of squeezed tangerine and sharp lemon-skin acidity arises, giving freshness while finishing with a pinch of vanilla dust.",US-California-Chardonnay
"91-93 Barrel sample. Very ripe fruit aromas. The palate is almost velvet in texture, smooth and rich, fruits packed with black berries and sweet plums. A charming, delicious wine.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A powerful take on the grape, this shows dried cherries, cherry blossoms, black pepper and torn-up concrete aromas on the nose. The palate is rich and luscious, with concentrated strawberries, smoked plums and purple flowers, as well as licorice, fudge and just enough roasted red bell pepper to show the varietal's greener side.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Hints of smoke and ash cast savory mineral tones onto sunny black cherry and blackberry that dominate this rich, subtly spiced red. While the palate is luscious and silky, there's a lingering astringency that marks the finish.",US-New York-Lemberger
"High toast and spice flavors dominate what is relatively light fruit. The wine is austere, somewhat lightweight, with freshness and wood the main elements.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Just the second Malbec from Fidélitas, this pure varietal bottling opens with deep, dark aromas of smoke, coffee and pepper, with saturated colors that seem to promise a dense, exotic wine. Though it is lively and offers nice flavors of pepper, berry and spice, it does not have the concentration in the mouth that the aromas suggest. There are some prickly herbal flavors, along with light chocolate, in the finish.",US-Washington-Malbec
"Tight and lean, this Rosso di Montepulciano shows nuances of white cherry and wild raspberry, followed by thorny acidity.",Italy-Tuscany-Prugnolo Gentile
"An astoundingly characterful rosé, the Mordorée Tavel has a hugely complex nose of cherry, carnation and strawberry set against a backdrop of herbes de Provence. Intensely flavorful in the mouth, this wine finishes on a long note of lemon zest and white cherries. An excellent foil for roast pork.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"Orange blossoms perfume this voluptuous yet elegantly structured Pinot Gris. It's lush and ripe in white peach and pineapple flavors, but jolted by a stream of tart lemony acidity. Finishes moderately long.",US-New York-Pinot Gris
"If you like your Voigniers flamboyant, this one's for you. It's an explosion of tangerines, golden mangoes, peaches and pears, with buttery, creamy overtones and a finish of honey. Lots of zesty acidity adds a balancing scour to the mouthfeel.",US-California-Viognier
"The Sarmassa cru consistently delivers some of the best Barolos on the market, and this opulent expression from Marchesi di Barolo proves the point. The wine exhibits modern aromas of chocolate, black cherry, coffee and Spanish cedar. The mouthfeel is soft, plush and rich.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Black cherries and chocolate combine on the palate, but there's also a certain weediness to the aromas. This blend of approximately 60% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon finishes strong, with tart fruit and a dose of chocolate.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Pezzo Morgana is a hearty red wine that opens with savory aromas of ripe blackberry, leather and cured meat. The finish is smooth and rich.",Italy-Southern Italy-Red Blend
"This is a wow wine, supported by small amounts of Petit Verdot and Malbec. Blood orange, cranberry, cassis and raspberry provide a crisp counterpoint to the firm tannin structure, ending with grace and plenty of body, smoothly textured and refined.",US-California-Red Blend
"Well structured, it places its raspberry fruit in a compact, focused core. An appealing and balanced mix of herb, baking spices, citrus and white pepper highlights give the wine complexity beyond its apparent lightness. Drink now–2019.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Because of a short vintage, this Clare Valley-based winery reached down into Padthaway for fruit. The result is a broad, slightly warm wine, marked by melon, peach and apricot flavors. Drink now.",Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"Briny citrus and sulfuric match-stick aromas lead to an edgy but fresh palate. Flavors of dry citrus and generic tropical fruits finish with citric acidity and monotone juiciness. Overall, this is a tart, fresh cleanser.",Chile-Central Valley-Carmenère
"This is a mature, single-vineyard wine. Beautifully perfumed, it includes, unusually, a small percentage of white grapes (historically a field blend) that soften the tannins of the 90% Baga. The wine is spicy, concentrated, dense with black fruits and tannins. It is ready to drink.",Portugal-Bairrada-Portuguese Red
"High alcohol gives this wine a distinct burn. The cherry fruit has a roasted fruit portiness, although the finish is entirely dry. Oak adds chocolaty toastiness. It's a good example of a big, ripe California red wine. Give it a good decanting and drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"This wine has distinct acidity, probably too much. Red currant fruits dominate, giving the wine elegance, but also showing some unripe fruit flavors and a texture that is too light and unfocused.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This totally fresh wine has benefited from the quality of whites in 2007 Bordeaux. It is lemony with pink grapefruit flavors giving an intense lift. There is some herbaceousness, with green herbs and juicy fruits. To drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Sauvignon Blanc
"This Prosecco delivers medium intensity and a compact, slightly watery mouthfeel followed by lime, kiwi, white flower, honey and chopped basil. The cheerful sparkler ends with creamy consistency thanks to the foamy quality of its effervescence.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"Made from Kiona Vineyards fruit, this Red Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon has the dark fruit and the dense tannins one might expect. But that meaty power is leavened by natural acidity. A highlight of orange peel accents the deep flavors of cassis and smoke. It turns a little chalky at the tail end.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Tasted alongside far more expensive Napa Cabs, this one held its own proudly. It shows impressive blackberry, currant and mint flavors, with a smoky, ashy overlay of oak. The firm tannins suggest modest ageability. Drink this dry, balanced Cab now through 2010.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This opens with smoky, rubbery aromas along with dark berry and cherry scents. It feels fresh and lively, with good body weight and forward, candied flavors of cherry and raspberry. The finish is nice, with cocoa notes and lasting sweetness.",Spain-Central Spain-Tempranillo
"This wine contains 14% “mixed blacks,” including grapes like Alicante Bouschet, and is powerful and ripe. Its flavors seem at once tart and sweet, framed by dusty cherry and vanilla. There's a persistent, feral, compost-like thread throughout its dense structure and tannic finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This offers aromas of dark berry, spice, tobacco and a whiff of vanilla. The palate delivers ripe black cherry layered with chocolate, coffee and white pepper. This is delicious and already drinking well but should develop complexity with more cellaring. Drink now through 2019.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"The oak (83% new French and American) seems a bit overweighted for the fruit that's in the bottle on this 100% varietal wine. The notes of vanilla, cocoa and woodspice get out in front of herb and cherry flavors that seem slightly stewed.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dryly fruited, this light and flavorful Monastrell (aka Mourv¡edre) blend is a winning, easy drinker. Clean and direct, with dry cherry licorice and mineral shadings, it's a simple and satisfying mouthful, great for patio dining with lighter grilled foods. Best Buy. —M.M.",Spain-Levante-Monastrell
"This is a very dry Pinot Noir, lowish in alcohol by current standards. It's not showing particularly well now, with a sour cherry and cranberry tartness that makes the mouth water. You can chew on this wine and it reveals plenty of mushroomy, meaty complexities, but it remains aloof and tough. Give it at least five years in a good cellar.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Named for the fact that the producer is one of 16 children, and the only one making wine, this Cab is entirely varietal, hailing from a St. Helena-based vineyard planted in 2001. The winery's inaugural vintage, it is herbaceous on the nose, followed by flavors of cedar and sweet tobacco. These provide a subtle, light tone and finish, with just the right amount of oak to give it backbone.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Soft aromas of lemon blossom, flower and citrus lead into appealing flavors of citrus, sea salt and spice. It's not an overly complex white but does not need to be. Enjoy this with grilled seafood, vegetables and fruit.",Greece-Mantinia-Moschofilero
"Barely drinkable, with sweet, sugary flavors and a few drops of citrus fruit.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A whiff of petrol leads off on this oaky, full-figured white, which is creamy and textured with a touch of sweetness on the finish.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"From one of the hottest vintages in recent years, this wine delivers layers of succulent wild cherry, crushed raspberry and cinnamon. It's balanced with firm but refined tannins and surprising freshness for the vintage. Drink through 2022.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This Riesling is a beautiful rose-copper color. Fresh flavors of white stone fruit and straw on the palate, with more of the same, plus some custard or cream, on the nose. It's medium-bodied and is more elegant than it is zippy or fresh. Finishes clean, with hay and peach.",Australia-Western Australia-Riesling
"This is beautifully rich and powerful, with tropical fruit flavors and a hint of wood. It has enormous concentration of sweet, ripe white and yellow fruits, balanced by the sharp cut of acidity.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This wine is ripe with attractive blackberry fruits and jammy acidity. The tannins play a fine supporting role, allowing the fruits to develop a warm, rich character. The wine could age, so drink from 2016. The Le Grix de la Salle family's sons have worked in Napa Valley, New Zealand and Spain before making wine at home. The château is a historical monument.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"It's nice to see the quality of this wine reach new heights, as it's still relatively affordable within the Henschke context. The blend includes Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. The 2013 shows a slightly austere side, an aristocratic reserve, but the flavors are classic. Pencil shavings, mint, cassis and cigar box finish with great drive, length and dusty tannins. Drink 2023–2035.",Australia-South Australia-Red Blend
"Starts with aromas of clove, coffee and black olive, then adds brighter flavors of red berries on the palate before picking up some tea-like notes and a hint of chocolate on the finish. This medium-bodied Shiraz should prove versatile at the table.",Australia-Australia Other-Shiraz
"Dark extraction and concentrated fruit set the stage. The wine has soft touches of blackberry fruit and plump cherry that are inevitably followed by tight tannins and sharp acidity. This is an astringent, firm wine that should be paired with fatty foods.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"The nose on this wine from the dynamic duo of Fresno State professor/winemaker Matt Brain and custom-crush manager/winemaker Josh Baker is well integrated, showing layers of dark berries, soy, dried violets, candied blueberry and a touch of caramel. It's soft and plush on the palate, with touches of milk chocolate, candied grapes and licorice.",US-California-Syrah

"Apple, peach and corn aromas are indicative of the chunky palate that comes next. Flavors run a touch stalky and grassy, with apple cider the key fruit component. Simple on the finish; middle of the road as a whole.",Spain-Northern Spain-Godello
"Despite being aged in used barrels, this does show some oaky notes, but they're well balanced by bushels of black cherry fruit. It's lush, creamy and harmonious, with a long finish and up to 10 years of longevity.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"A pretty pale peach color, this wine has aromas of cherry, herbs and mineral. It drinks dry with generous, mouthwateringly tart cherry and watermelon flavors.",US-Washington-Sangiovese
"Lemon and freshly squeezed lime give this attractive wine a crisp, bright texture that is rounded out at the end with perfumed flavors from the Moscatel in the blend. This fruity, textured wine needs a few more months before drinking. Drink from late 2015.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"This single-vineyard Barolo is fragrant, with violet, leather and underbrush aromas. The palate shows bright red-cherry flavors and layers of cinnamon and other spices. Despite the forward nature of the vintage, this actually needs a few more years to open up.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Red berry, violet and a whiff of moist earth lead the nose on this simple red. The lean, rather diluted palate shows tart sour cherry, cranberry and a hint of graphite alongside bracing acidity. Fleeting tannins give it an abrupt finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A thoroughly elegant, serious and yet immensely enjoyable wine that stays lively many days after opening, this bottling from a regional icon shows dried violets, dried strawberry, crushed pepper and touches of leather and soy on the wondrous nose. Lithe black plum and elderberry fruits ride along a tight but forgiving tannic structure, with support from crushed gravel, asphalt, potpourri, sandalwood and cedar flavors.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of ripe plum, violet, vanilla, toast and leafy underbrush come together on this is full-bodied red. The palate offers black cherry marinated in spirits, grilled porcini mushroom and dried aromatic herb alongside assertive tannins that leave a somewhat drying finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Here's an easygoing (and well-priced) Nero d'Avola with fresh tones of cherry, blueberry and white almond. It's a compact and simple wine that would pair well with informal stay-home meals.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"Rubber, mushroom and smoke rise up on the hot, molten nose, while the palate is hard, tough to penetrate and narrow, with dark berry and piercing pepper accents. Tough to dig into and find higher qualities. Thus it comes across as a surface wine without much depth or elegance.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Earthy berry and cola aromas are clean and ripe. This feels fresh on the tongue, with medium-level weight and power. Flavors run toward cassis and berry but fade quickly, with little to the finish. This is Garnacha with 25% Tempranillo.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"Heavy-handed oak on the nose is reflected through aromas of wet cement, char and wood resin. A grabby palate is full of oak tannin, while this tastes saucy and earthy, with savory berry and black-plum flavors. On the finish, the flavor of residual raw oak is strong.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Crystal Valley is a Cosentino brand, and this single-vineyard wine is fruity and tasty, with the rich, honeyed texture of a fully ripe wine. Has a kiss of oak and a nice, long, citrusy finish.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"In ‘99 Adelsheim bottled two separate clonal selections; this year they have elected to combine the two. This lovely, young wine, with very ripe, tight fruit, is already showing a bit more peach, apricot and tropical scents than the previous vintage. This is a concentrated, complex and powerful style, which harnesses the oak rather than being driven by it. Delicious and exceptionally long.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"The curtain rises to smooth, lightly balsamic aromas of blackberry, black cherry and cedar. On the tongue, this Malbec is plush, smooth, chewy and a touch creamy. Elevated berry, mocha and vanilla flavors are oaky but not overdone. The finish is pure, succinct and deep, with lasting black-fruit echoes. Drink through 2019.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This wine displays all of the intensity of expression of Cold Creek. Aromas of toasty spices and pear are light but lead to a full, rich-feeling palate, with the acids providing a perfect counterbalance.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Lots of rich, extracted cherry pie, chocolate and cassis flavors in this soft, oaky Cabernet. It's a little sweet and hot, but will drink well now with grilled steak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Apple and fig are layered throughout this elegant, medium-bodied wine that offers the ripeness of a warm vintage without veering into sweetness. The barrel impact is managed well, adding to the impact of honey and dried nuts on the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This offers a raw, sharp note of garden herb and white cherry. The natural acidity and crispness suggests it should pair well with cheese ravioli in a sage butter sauce.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Cannonau
"I continue to be impressed by how well even entry-level 2015 Sauvignons are developing. This one is understated and grapefruity, with hints of pea shoots and a silky feel. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc

"A rich wine, opulent in character. There is power here, with richness of fruit and texture. It is both serious side and exuberant, with its bursting black berry fruits.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Yellowish to tan in color, this young wine is already showing signs of age, but get it early and you'll find creamy but sturdy flavors of squash, kumquat and peach. There's oak in support and plenty of personality. Whether that personality is universally appealing, however, is doubtful.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"Herb, anise, baking-spice, smoke and dark-fruit aromas are followed by medium-bodied fruit flavors surrounded by velvety tannins. The balance is just about spot on.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This has the classic lightness of sweet Jurançon, with balance between the honeyed character and brilliant acidity. This is sweet, but so poised and crisp at the same time. Apricot and dried raisins are blended with lemon juice. The wine is still young; drink from 2017.",France-Southwest France-Gros and Petit Manseng

"A sweet style of white Port, almost tawny in character, with nuts, acidity and old fruit flavors. Crystallized red fruits add an extra element. Drink by itself, or as long cocktail with tonic.",Portugal-Port-Port
"This has been a very successful second label from Goldschmidt, and with this 2009, they again hit gold. The wine is smoothly tannic and dry in black cherry- pie and red currant flavors, with all kinds of interesting herb, carob bean, spice and oak complications. It's elegant and complex to drink now and over the next 5–6 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"At almost half Cabernet Franc (49%), this is slightly leafier than what most producers are pulling out of the Gimblett Gravels.

Drink 2019–2030.",New Zealand-Hawke's Bay-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Wood aged for 12 months, this dense and structured wine comes from a small parcel of vines in the Clos de Vougeot. It is perfumed, ripe with a solid series of tannins as well as red-berry fruits. The acidity is typical of the vintage, and, along with the tannins, will allow this powerful wine to age well. Drink from 2022.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Ebullient floral and honey notes bolster the intense, ripe, fleshy mango and peach flavors in this powerful Riesling. Full bodied and remarkably dry in style, with a richly textured, almost feathered mouthfeel. It finishes exceptionally long, with a bristle of lemon-lime acidity.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling

"There are excellent savory qualities to this bottling, with white pepper, charred lamb, soy and pine resin adding much intrigue to the black currant fruit. The umami character is strong on the sip, with beef jerky, black pepper and wild mushroom broth flavors, but there is also some tangy fruit as well as upright tannins that will keep this wine singing for years. Drink now–2028.",US-California-Syrah
"Blended with 50% Sauvignon Musque that gives it a distinctly floral note, this wine has just a touch of oak, which gives it some smoky toastiness.

"This is an earthy herbal wine that's also soft and supple on the palate. Dill, cedar and sage play against a tart core of cranberry and cassis, finding their way to a lingering layer of spicy clove. The power and weight of the fruit wears well against the ultimate grace of the wine.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Subdued aromas of yellow stone fruit and a whiff of cut grass lead the nose. The linear, rather slender palate shows grapefruit, tomato leaf and lime alongside brisk acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"Fresh, lively and brimming over with fruit flavor, from lemon to lime to peach. The appearance is light gold, the aromas are very immediate and effusive, the texture tangy and the finish light with a hint of sweetness.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This kitchen sink-style blend shows a whiff of volatility along with notes of vanilla and cherry candy. The palate is full of sweet, plump fruit flavors that linger on the finish.",US-America-Red Blend
"A dusting of pollen and dusty minerals lends savoriness to this fresh, citrusy Riesling. Off-dry in style, it's cutting and spry, balancing primary tangerine and lemon flavors against lingering earthiness.",US-New York-Riesling
"88—90 Barrel sample. The man who makes Dassault aeroplanes, also owns this property. It's improving, as witnessed by this dense, dark wine, very solid, dark chocolate.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The song of the frogs, aka the croak, is an odd name for this wine made from organically grown grapes. The wine itself is soft, easy and light, with red berry fruits and some perfumed acidity. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"Rusty orange in color, aromas of grass and tomato suggest underripe fruit, while the mouthfeel is foamy and the flavors of fruit and mushroom are muted.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"From an old block of vines, producing a field blend of many different varieties, Vinha Maria Teresa is a major wine. Its low yields, firm tannins and dense wood aging give it great staying power. Black plum surge through the chocolate flavors and are given point by acidity. Age this fine wine until 2018.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"A medium-bodied, dark-fruited Pinot, the 2007 from Allan Scott features some compost-like notes to go with smoke, cola and coffee aromas and flavors. It doesn't lack for flavor but rather for elegance, coming across as a bit chunky.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir

"Pinot Grigio has yet to find a distinguishing style in Washington State. This is borderline generic, almost beery, a plain, pleasant, fairly neutral white wine with a mix of white peaches and green apples.",US-Washington-Pinot Grigio
Fresh smoke from your grandpa's pipe swirls with aromas of cherry pie and cinnamon-vanilla cream on this wine named after the year Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa was founded. Flavors range from Earl Grey tea to crushed violets and frothy blackberry sorbet. Only 22 barrels made.,US-California-Pinot Noir
"From 100% estate-grown grapes, and possessing 6.8 g/L of residual sugar, this wine is lovely in peach, pear and lemon, and quite voluptuous in texture, with a hint of spice. Pretty floral aromas of jasmine provide additional flourish and invitation, with the finish dry.",US-California-Riesling

"Baked strawberries and red cherries pair deliciously with shaved nutmeg, vanilla and black tea leaves on the nose of this bottling. There is a strong black plum tang to the sip, which is decorated lavishly with thyme, bay leaf, rust and gravel—a very elegant expression overall.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"While the wine does have considerable tannins, it also has the ripe Merlot fruit to support it. Good acidity, black currant fruits, smoky wood, all the elements are there. It will always be firm, but should mature well.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"From Duckhorn, a very serious producer, but this is their fun wine. Not to say this blend of Zin, Cab, Merlot and Cab Franc isn't a heavyweight red. It is, with massive berry, cherry, chocolate and peppery spice flavors. But it seems designed for easier fare, such as barbecue. At its best over the next 5 years.",US-California-Red Blend
"Thanks to eight years in Vin Santo's traditional caratelli barrels, this sweet blend of Trebbiano and Malvasia offers a dark, golden-amber color, bearing intense aromas of dried apricot, candied fruit, honey and toasted almond.",Italy-Tuscany-White Blend
"Good price for a Cabernet of this quality, and one that's been aged for four-plus years. It's soft and mellow and drinkable now, with enjoyable blackberry, currant, licorice, spice and cedar flavors.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A great Cabernet that will proudly stand beside the best of Napa Valley. Made in the modern style, it's soft and sweet in blackberry, cherry, currant and dark-chocolate flavors, but the finish is thoroughly dry, wrapped in a scour of tannins and acids. So good to drink now, you might forget to age it, but don't. This will provide plenty of deliciousness over the next six-plus years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a luxuriously layered and complex white. It's an expertly rendered combination of ripe, rich fruit—most notably spicy apple and pear—that's completely uplifted by bright acidity and a refreshing mouthfeel. Still youthful, it's both vibrant and nuanced.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Everything in this full-bodied wine comes in big helpings, from the deep garnet color to aromas of rich oak and ripe fruit, to the mouthfilling black-cherry flavors. Yet it doesn't go over the top and achieves a high-level complexity that's delicious.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Sometimes you just need a cheap, quaffable, crisp dry white wine to drink in copious amounts, and this one will do just fine, thank you. It's citrusy, spicy, and dry, and has enough acid to cleanse the palate.",Chile-Central Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"It's full of bright red fruits, a lively mineral texture and a pure line of acidity. Bone dry, it is as fresh and crisp as possible.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Girolamo is a Merlot from the southern part of Chianti Classico that does a remarkable job of being modern and delicate at the same time. On the one hand, you get rich notes of chocolate, cherry and coffee, but on the other, you get ethereal nuances of blueberry, spice and cola. Ready to drink.",Italy-Tuscany-Merlot
"This straightforward red conveys aromas of red berry, underbrush and a lightly toasted note. The palate offers juicy morello cherry, toasted almond and a hint of white pepper plus lithe tannins. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
A straightforward nose with honest raspberry fruit and an underlying green plum note. There's well-defined acidity and rounded tannins though a turnip note makes for a less than stellar ending. Drink now to 1 year.,US-New York-Pinot Noir
"Sugary orange-jam and vanilla flavors are brightened by crisp acidity that gives this wine a clean finish. Lightly-oaked, it's easy to drink on its own, or with appetizers such as tempura, bacon-wrapped shrimp or toast with goat cheese and roasted peppers.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"With its good bottle age, this bone-dry Champagne from Roederer has gained impressive complexity. The wine is certainly dry, but toast, vanilla and ground almond flavors add to the fruit. The apple skin texture holds this delicious wine together.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"A much-loved, easy-drinking wine from near the Italian capital, Fontana Candida is one of Rome's most popular dinner companions. The wine is fresh and easy with simple aromas of stone fruit, citrus and a lean mouthfeel.",Italy-Central Italy-White Blend
"With the pale color and flavor of a peach just turning orange-pink and a delicate mouthfeel, this is a great example of blush bubbly made from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. It shows a great deal of class for the price.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Fruit-forward aromas of blueberry, orange peel and spice lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors. It's respectable, though it's near impossible to peg it as Cabernet.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Smooth, svelte and utterly delicious, this glossy, seamless Petit Verdot is packed with bright flavors of berry, cherry and plum. The management of the fruit is perfect, and the barrel aging adds proportionate streaks of espresso and mocha. The finish is long and creamy.",US-Washington-Petit Verdot
"This lightly sweet wine offers apples and cream and ripe apricot flavors. It is rich, but not obvious, the acidity and freshness just as important as the sweet fruit. It is clean, with a soft, ripe aftertaste.",Austria-Burgenland-Grüner Veltliner
"Aromas of ripe dark berry, blue flower and a hint of baking spice waft from the glass. On the palate, notes of graphite, licorice and touch of smoke add depth to the ripe black cherry flavors. Firm tannins provide support.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"Woody aromas smell much like warm cedar, and that's backed up by some nice cherry and cassis. There's plenty of pleasant red fruit on the palate, and not a hint of green. Some chocolaty earthiness makes it all the more cheerful. It's an easy drinker that delivers solid Cab character without a lot of fuss and heavy extraction.",Chile-Rapel Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Break out the pizza with tomato sauce and gooey, oily mozzarella. That's what this tough, gritty Bordeaux-style blend with added Sangiovese needs to soften and mellow. It's a good wine, ripe in berries and spices, but rustic.",US-California-Red Blend
"The Selezione Vigna La Casa is equally sweet and ripe as the estate's base Brunello from the same vintage. What distinguishes this wine, however, is the firmness of its structure and the grainy texture of its tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"This wine shows some of the less appealing aspects of American oak: overt spice and vanilla flavors and a slick, oily mouthfeel.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Plum, berry and milk chocolate aromas are not too aggressive. The palate is round and friendly feeling, with flavors of wild berry, sweet oak and carob. Finishes with solid oaky flavors. Good Syrah that's uncomplicated and generally well made.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Syrah
"Aromas of peach pit are neutral except for some oily notes. This multigrape blend feels plump, oily and propped up by solid acidity. Pithy flavors of grapefruit and melon are slightly bitter on the finish.",Spain-Catalonia-White Blend
"All the Fèvre vines are at the top of this vineyard, giving very structured, long-lived wines. This is certainly an age-worthy wine, tightly coiled and nervy, with a strong mineral note at its heart. Lemon and quince flavors are caught up in the complex structure. Drink from 2020.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This wine offers a pleasing mixture of aromas and flavors of baking spices, pear and apple. Viscosity and weight gives it a sense of gravitas but never gets bogged down.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"In 2012, my favorite of the Kumeu River Chardonnays is the medium- to full-bodied, creamy-textured offering from Hunting Hill. Think streusel-topped citrus, but dry, with a long, harmonious finish.",New Zealand-Kumeu-Chardonnay
"Fresh strawberry flavors, followed by some vanilla and sweet acidity characterize this wine from the Lagrezette winery. With its blend of Malbec, Syrah and white Viognier, this has softness, ripeness and, despite its acidity, a definite sweet finish.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"This is a dark and muscular expression of Syrah executed in a quasi-Australian style, with loads of concentration and spice, backed by smoked bacon, Teriyaki, candied berry and Indian spice.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Syrah
"This low-production Pinot shows off the elegance and balance you expect from this famous vineyard. The wine is dry and tart in acidity, with drink-me-now cranberry, pomegranate, mushroom and new oak flavors. Decant it for an hour or two.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is an organically farmed blend of Sangiovese (80%) and Syrah (20%) with elegant mineral tones at the back of red berry, smoke and campfire. Elegance and harmony stand out here and the flavors are smoky and ashy.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Here's a creamy white that delivers aromas and flavors of white peach, pear and white almond. A mineral note and fresh acidity lift the finish.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"Lots of oaky flavors mark this dry wine. Buttered toast, brown butter and vanilla flavors dominate the underlying peach, pear, citrus and mango flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This second wine of Labégorce Margaux is named after the former neighboring estate Labégorce Zédé that was amalgamated after the 2009 vintage. This is a ripe wine, full of the fruit of the vintage as well as having a firm dry tannic structure that will allow it to age. With juicy blackberry fruits still so youthful, it is going to be ready drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Fresh and broad aromas of strawberry syrup meet with eucalyptus oil and wild mint on the clean if simple nose of this bottling. It grows more tart on the sip, with roasted red plum, cranberry and pomegranate, but the fascinating parts are the curious hints of cannabis and hops, which give herbal depth to the fruit.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This Syrah-dominant blend, with 25% Carignan and 5% Grenache, leads with oak-driven aromas of charred cedar, sweet smoke and vanilla bean that envelop the ripe blackberry and cherry fruit tones. The palate is lush and full, with a creamy roundness that's partially lifted by generous spicy notes of garrigue, licorice root and black pepper on the close.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rhône-style Red Blend
"A light, straightforward and focused wine, 100% varietal, this offers cranberry, mushroom and a complexity of tannin and oak. High acidity dances around fresh layers of strawberry and raspberry on the palate, with a grippy, cinnamon-spiced finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A pure, young Chardonnay made in a Chablis style, but you don't want to drink it now. Shows the acidic minerality of Carneros, with citrus, tropical fruit, wildflower and honey flavors. Too tight and unyielding. Give it until mid-2010 to mellow.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This solidly built, dry wine made from the unusual Tannat variety has mild apple and cherry flavors and great balance. Its texture is firm due to good acidity and a touch of tannin, which makes it versatile with foods from pho to barbecue.",US-California-Tannat
"From the Cortona area of eastern Tuscany, here is a simple, bright and crisp expression of Sangiovese that would pair with grilled meat or sausage.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Medium straw-colored in the glass, this wine offers aromas of orange blossom, white tea and seawater. There is a nice balance of smooth fruit and brightness, with flavors of ripe peach and pear that will cause a bit of a pucker on the side palate right into the lingering peach finish.",Israel-Galilee-Chardonnay
"A touch of campfire smoke invites the nose into this bottling from a historic vineyard. It also offers aromas of dark cranberry, black raspberry, chipped slate and roasting meat. The cran-raspberry element explodes on the generous palate, backed by that familiar smoke, which is laced throughout this wine.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Intense aromas of red-skinned berry, fragrant blue flower, Oriental spice and a whiff of graphite take center stage. The taut, chewy palate doles out Marasca cherry, blackberry, anise, mocha and a peppery note alongside bright acidity and polished, fine-grained tannins.",Italy-Southern Italy-Red Blend
"Honeyed crème brûlée flavor is the highlight of this salty, moderately structured wine that's fairly priced and simple in its approach.",US-California-Chardonnay
"I Capitani, a dynamic family-run winery not far from Taurasi, opts for a traditional wine that puts more emphasis on elegance and complexity and less focus on brawn and power. Aromas include cherry, cola, tar, licorice and red apple. The wine is already a bit brownish on its edges, so don't wait long to drink it.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"This is a ripe, generous wine. The structure typical of Touriga Nacional is submerged in the perfumed blackberry and ripe plum flavors. It's a big wine, with tannins softly cushioned in the rich fruitiness. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Tejo-Touriga Nacional
"Glimmers of game and pepper infuse the red-fruit-driven core of this wine. Plum, raspberry and cherry, dusted with notes of baking spice, flourish on the palate. Medium weight, with dusty tannins, this is reminiscent of crushed dried berries.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Lots of primary aromas show on this bottling, including Concord grape, grapeseed, raisin and fresh-pressed blackberry juice, along with a hint of licorice. The wine is somewhat light in body, but with lots of enjoyable black fruit and anise flavors.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a firm, almost fleshy style, with solid peach fruit and highlights of grapefruit pith and rind. It emphasizes fruit over flower, and finishes quite dry.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Damp, earthy cherry aromas and saucy plum notes amount to a rocky opening. A grabby, drying, tannic palate and wiry plum flavors end with burnt overtones, a drawing feel and bitterness.",Argentina-Other-Malbec
"The wine is dense with great fruit and accompanying structure. With its dark ripe berry fruits and full tannins, the wine is powerful although with great elegance. It is stylish, full of complexity ready to age well. Drink from 2024.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"What you need to know about this wine is that it's pretty sweet. Straddles the border of off-dry, with sugary pineapple, tangerine and vanilla flavors.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"This pure Mourvèdre begins well, offering a full palate of varietal flavors that are built upon a mix of citrus and ripe tree fruits, along with accents of leaf and forest. It turns soft and seems a bit overripe, running into a rather short finish.",US-Washington-Mourvèdre
"This is top drawer—elegant, detailed and richly varietal. The fruit is tart and tangy but not sour or thin. Mixed green fruits, apple, citrus, and a lightly toasty nose set up a wine with impressive length. The midpalate richness includes ripe melon, butterscotch and cinnamon spice. It's all barrel-fermented in neutral oak. This is a real strength of the brand.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"Rachis refers to a particular part of the grape stem, and indicates that roughly one quarter of this wine is whole cluster fermented. Very pretty cherry fruit is gently mixed with accents of Italian herbs, and the stems tighten up the tannins and add a light hint of bitterness. The finish has a tart, grapefruity kick.",US-Washington-Syrah
Aromas of vanilla and cocoa mix with red fruit. The fruit flavors are full and palate coating but the oak seems a little too intense at times.,US-Washington-Grenache
"This opens with black-skinned berry, tobacco and underbrush aromas. The firm palate shows black plum, clove and white pepper flavors, with assertive tannins that leave a drying finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"The aromas are clean and varietal, and the fruit follows along with pleasant, light pear and apple flavors, buoyed by tangy acids.",US-Washington-Pinot Grigio
"Unusually complex for a rosé, this medium- to full-bodied wine offers a mix of red berries and melon, hints of cinnamon and clove, richness reminiscent of white chocolate and even a tinge of mocha on the lengthy finish. Drink now–2018.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"Exotic yellow-spice notes meet with lean lime pith on the light and crisp nose of this old-vine expression from a historic winery. Meyer-lemon rind and juice show brightly on the palate, where grippy chalkiness complements rich lemon-curd flavors.",US-California-Pinot Blanc
"Made from dried Nebbiolo grapes, this structured wine weaves together plum, raisin, leather, earth, carob, balsamic and mineral notes. Combining power and finesse, it's well balanced but still young, with a firmly tannic backbone. Drink after 2017.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This juicy, ripe and rich wine has a sweet jammy background, giving concentration as well as good acidity and an open, ripe texture. Drink this already accessible wine from 2025.",Portugal-Port-Port
"This unoaked Chardonnay has ripe, creamy fruit, along with acidity that seems typical of the 2002 vintage. Elegant and lively, with nice crispness.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Chardonnay
"Spunky and bright in terms of its aromatics, with musky lime and mineral notes. The palate is both juicy and round, with lemon, lime and piercing, pithy citrus flavors. Citric, sheering and foxy on the finish, and exceedingly cleansing.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"From blocks of old Wente vines planted in the 1970s, this producer and site continue to find beautiful synergy together. This wine shows high-toned floral notes around full-bodied richness and flavors of crème brûlée and anise. A salty accent begs for attention as a kick of citrus finishes with grace and freshness.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Chardonnay has not been Silverado's strong suit in recent years and the tight, lean 2008 does not alter that conclusion. The wine is dry and acidic, with citrus and apple flavors that lack charm.",US-California-Chardonnay
"From a 24-acre vineyard with vines aged from five to 65 years, this is an attractively fruity wine. Ripe apple flavors gain even greater liveliness from the twist of citrus zest. It is ready to drink with all its freshness.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Whiffs of reeds and dusty mineral contrast sharply against sunny, slightly candied citrus and peach flavors on the palate. It's medium sweet with a delicate, dainty composure. Drink now.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Exhibiting stalky blackberry fruits, this wine is on the austere side, promising some good aging. The fruit, acidity and tannins are in fine balance.",France-Southwest France-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Smoke and leather tack-room scents and flavors, making for a sharp, short, fruitless wine.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"General Patton stayed at the Dampierre estate on his march towards Germany in World War II and this rich Chardonnay is made in his honor. It is a ripe, full-bodied wine that has a tight structure and tense citrus and mineral texture. It makes a strong statement, probably like its namesake.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"Apple, hay and lots of toasty oak yield a very butterscotchy wine. But the oak keeps coming on, burying all else and rendering the wine ponderous. Xarello, a lighter white usually used in Cava blends, could perhaps yield an interesting still wine with mainstream appeal using less wood.",Spain-Catalonia-Xarel-lo
"Delicate aromas of tomato vine, freshly cut grass and a whiff of tropical fruit emerge on this straightforward white. The vibrant, rather lean palate shows grapefruit, citrus zest and a hint of green melon alongside racy acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"Made by longtime Napa winemakers Bernard Portet and Bob Pepi, this Cab is a complex study of bittersweet chocolate, cedar and herb. Juicy, it features a well-managed use of oak and medium body and weight, finishing with a sense of elegance.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe and perfumed, this is packed with the richness of 2010 along with its structure. It has weight, juicy black and red berry fruits and a tense structure that still needs time. Acidity at the end provides a fresh lift to the essentially firm wine.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The toasted oak aromas are still evident on the nose, so give this a few more years to unwind before opening. With patience, you'll be rewarded with tones of bright fruit, spice, licorice, molasses, brown sugar and tobacco. There's a hint of red apple on the finish, rendering it fresh and zesty.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Elegant peach and floral tones on this off-dry Riesling build in complexity on the nose and palate, with layers of waxy lanolin and fresh green herbs. It's forward and fruity, yet honed and balanced, with bright lemon-lime acidity.",US-New York-Riesling
"Really? A five-buck Oregon Riesling? It's light, lemony and tart, but it's real wine, simple and plain, yet fine with shellfish or other light seafood.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Intensely ripe, almost pulpy black fruit lends a soft, easy feel to this richly textured Cabernet Franc. It's a tad clunky on the palate, but bright acidity and savory herbaceousness add elegance to the finish.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"Initially this Rioja seems topped by gritty aromas of tire rubber and burnt leaves, but with airing it gets more earthy and presentable. Tight tannins and a firm structure are the greeting on the palate, while flavors of stewed berries, herbs and oak take things to a warm, lightly baked finish with balance and length. The more this wine breathes, the better it shows. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"This is a delicious wine with fresh fruits that are crisply embedded in balanced acidity, melon and orange zest flavors. The wine has structure, minerality and a tight texture that contrasts with all this fruitiness. The finish is intense with acidity. Although the wine could be drunk now, it will be better from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"This wine is smooth, mature and rich with yellow fruits and a rounded texture. A hint of wood and spice has plenty of crisp acidity to balance. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Intriguing notes of blackcurrant surface at first, displaying both the full and juicy ripeness of dark berry fruit and a lifted leafiness. Hints of tar and slight notes of iron oxide create a haunting picture of a potent wine made from dense, ripe but fresh fruit. With more air, the characteristic red and black cherry fruit shines through. This is complex and rewarding, even luscious in its brooding, mysterious dark reaches to which the fine tannins stretch. Drink 2017–2025.",Austria-Burgenland-Blaufränkisch
"This small-lot Bonarda is one of Argentina's bright examples of the variety. It's ripe but brushy smelling, with chocolate and vanilla aromas blending with blackberry and herbs. Feels super fresh and juicy, with boysenberry, blackberry and chocolaty flavors. Very good overall.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Bonarda
"Textured, mineral and tight wine, its crisp acidity a refreshing feature. It's very fresh, terroir-driven, a wine that shows its origins right up front. Apples and citrus add to the bright, fruity nature of this wine.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Alluring aromas of ripe berry, violet, iris, baking spice and fennel take center stage on this stunning red. The structured palate delivers juicy red berry, black raspberry, clove and star anise alongside fresh acidity and close-grained tannins. A mineral note energizes the finish.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend

"This is warm region, warm vintage Syrah at its decadent best. It opens with generous aromas of raspberry and blackberry jam, along with plum pit, mineral, black olive and smoked meat. The flavors are velvety and palate coating, rich and intense, with black-fruit notes that glide on the extended finish. The sense of texture is dazzling.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This is a typical sweet rosé from Anjou. A light and fruity blend of Groslot and Gamay, it is sugary but has attractive acidity to balance the sweet wild-strawberry flavors. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Rosé
"Medium in build and high in minerality, this fruity, dark-cherry wine is tethered by sizable oak and tannin. It finds its balance midway through, before offering a substantial finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"In this new vintage of Sorella, Cabernet Sauvignon is again right out front at 72% of the blend. Here the fruit seems more subdued, the wine tight, the dense tannins showing graphite and mineral more than new barrel flavors. It definitely needs decanting.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"A blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this easygoing red has aromas of underbrush, truffle, black plum and a whiff of toast. The soft round palate is already rather evolved, offering dried black cherry, clove and a hint of raisin alongside soft, supple tannins. It's extremely approachable, so enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This Crianza has leathery aromas, a tannic mouthfeel and roasted, spicy red berry flavors. It's dry, oaky and not particularly ripe.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"A big, rounded wine, its acidity a foil to the ripe fruit and dusty texture. The structure is chunky and corpulent, the fruit strawberry and red plum fruit packed tightly. It is still integrating, definitely promising some long-term aging.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"By “Old Vine Cabernet” the winery refers to vines that were planted in 1973. But somehow the fruit doesn't express old-vine character. Instead, it's a mix of sweet-tasting strawberry and bitter stem flavors that lack focus, with a peppery highlight.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a simple, correct Valpolicella with clean aromas of cherry, blueberry, white almond and raspberry cola. It has a smooth, soft mouthfeel with one-dimensional fruit flavors.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Here's a beautiful Chianti Classico from Panzano's Conca d'Oro, or Golden Basin, one of the best areas in the denomination. It has compelling aromas of pipe tobacco, crushed cherry, smoke and leather. The palate delivers juicy black-cherry, plum, clove, carob and mineral flavors. This wine has a beautiful structure, elegance and mesmerizing depth.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"From primo Zin country comes this pretty red wine. Starts out with jammy, youthful aromas of wild berries and turns soft and fruity in the mouth. Although the flavors are nice, it’s a bit watery, although the spicy finish will leave your palate tingling.",US-California-Zinfandel
"On first whiff, there's a savoriness to this nutty, slightly smoky wine. Aeration reveals fresher tones of blossom and tangerine. Dry in style with crisp, cutting acidity it offers elegance and refreshment at a gentle price.",Germany-Pfalz-Riesling
"Combine a warm year with too much time in bottle and this is what you get. This chunky, barrel-fermented Verdejo smells and tastes of early oxidation; it's creamy on the palate and strained in terms of flavors. Wheaty, leesy, faded melon and apple flavors have lost their verve.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"Opens with aromatics of jalapeño, fresh lettuce, green apple and white pepper. The body is lithe and dances across the palate, while flavors of tangerine, Yellow Delicious apples and passion fruit are clean, light and familiar. An easygoing, likable and honest style of Sauvignon Blanc.",Chile-Central Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"his blend of 57% Chardonnay, 41% Pinot Noir and 2% Pinot Meunier is drier than the winery's Extra Dry Riche. It is softly textured, layered in green apple and pear, and offers a medium finish. A versatile wine for pairing, it makes a good go-to for larger gatherings.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Not a lot of wood scents are showing, though the aging took place in roughly 50% new oak barrels. This has forward, pretty black fruits, juicy acids, some still-unresolved astringency, and aromatically it incorporates a nice herbal note, reminiscent of green tea. Still too young to drink, and the rating could go higher with more bottle age.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
The Jonck family's wine is dense and still young with firm tannins. It has excellent potential because the ripe berry fruits are right there to give richness and flesh out the tannins. Spice and acidity fill the background. Drink this fine wine from 2019.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This is a young, perfumed wine with attractive red fruits. While the wood is showing at the moment, that will fade as the wine develops, giving a fresh, raspberry-dominated wine. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Apples, sea salt, green pear and buttered popcorn aromas convey both restraint and ripeness on the nose of this wine by pioneer Pierre Lafond and longtime winemaker Bruce McGuire. There's tarragon tension once sipped, with flavors hovering between soft ruby-red grapefruit pith and ripe red apples, keeping the mouth watering throughout.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Light and vibrantly high in integrated acidity, this wine is complex and savory, but white pepper is a constant. Along the nuanced layers are an earthy patch of wild strawberry and cardamom that persists elegantly on the palate.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of baked plum, underbrush, grilled herb and mocha lead the nose on this dense, soft wine. The concentrated palate delivers blackberry, black cherry, vanilla, clove and black pepper notes alongside velvety tannins.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
It's almost worth buying this bottling just for the extravagant medieval label design. Luckily the wine is lives up to the heraldic billing. It is rich while also well structured. Juicy berry fruits and fresh black currant acidity show well against a still-tannic structure. The wine comes from the Moreaud family. Drink from 2017.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"More than three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, the balance is Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with just pinches of Sangiovese (2%) and Zinfandel (1%), it plays on the savory and green end of the Cabernet spectrum, with notes of green olive and dried herbs along with cherry and chocolate and a tingly, gritty feel.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Made from the native Pecorino grape, this has pretty floral aromas that mingle with bright sensations of tropical fruit and citrus. It's simple but well constructed and enjoyable.",Italy-Central Italy-Pecorino
"Tannic and chewy, this is simple, sturdy and solidly in the herbal camp. Flavors are short and the finish leans into veggies.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"While the nose suggests hints of oxidation, the bright palate brims with fresh apple and pear flavors. It's plump and rich in mouthfeel, accented by streaks of caramel, toast and spice.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Shows the aggressive tannins that often mark this unruly variety, but that's part of the charm. It's a big, potent wine, muscular in blackberry, black currant, leather and black pepper flavors, and best of all it's dry without high alcohol. A very nice wine to drink now with barbecue or beef stew made with the wine or one similar to it.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"This is tight and closed, with bitter tannins. It takes a while for the red berry flavor to surface, offering a wine that has potential for richness in 3–4 years time. It will always have a final, mineral-driven tautness.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The wine is fresh, so crisp and fruity. Its red currant fruit and lively acidity are rounded out by a caramel flavor that gives richness. The aftertaste though is dry and packed with fruit. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Rosé
"This wine's underbrush, truffle, leather and herb aromas unfold in the glass. The firmly structured palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, espresso, oak-driven spice and toast flavors framed by close-grained tannins. Roasted coffee bean and powdered sage notes mark the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A bold, chewy expression of the variety, Summit exhibits its 15% whole-cluster fermentation. It also is given more oak, a chance to tame its wild black cherry and lush cola spice. Black tea and a trace of red fruit play into the personality of the wine, adding a brightness to what is otherwise a decadent, full-throttle wine, barely tamed at that. Drink now through 2023.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Perfumed berry, pressed violet, leather and a balsamic note lead the nose of this 100% Sangiovese. The sleek, savory palate doles out fleshy black cherry, licorice, clove and tobacco interwoven with lithe tannins and fresh acidity.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese

Drink now–2015.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine brings aromas of toast, dried herbs, dark raspberries and cranberries. It's silky in texture, with the concentration a bit wanting. It doesn't seem entirely varietal but it still provides enjoyment.",US-Washington-Sangiovese
"This is a perfectly drinkable wine, with good fruit from a great vineyard. It's a bit minty and chalky; let's say rustic. The mixed flavors border on the lightly vegetal side of cool-climate fruit; not sweet but firm.",US-Washington-Sangiovese
"This is one of the best Bordeaux blends now available from Paso Robles. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's enormously ripe in blackberry jam, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors that finish lush and spicy. The tannins are strong, but negotiable with barbecue.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Made of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot and 5% Canaiolo, this opens with subtle floral and black fruit aromas. It's a simple red, showing cherry and clove flavors, framed by relaxed tannins. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"There's lots of zesty acidity in this wine. Reviewed in March, it still had a spritz on the palate, although by the time of general release it should mellow out. It will still be a zingy wine, clean and almost dry with orange, peach, mango and honeysuckle flavors.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"This wine includes 8% Petite Sirah and smaller amounts of Petit Verdot, Syrah, Zinfandel and Merlot, fleshing out a rich, full-bodied embrace of chewy tannin and extracted blackberry and brick tar. Let it hang in the glass awhile and swirl a time or two to get it to speak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

The dense, warm palate delivers chocolate, coffee, vanilla, plum and sweet oak alongside searing alcohol. It's already tired and evolved, and almost past its prime.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Wood aging has produced a well-rounded wine. It has a citrus flavor to go with the more tropical fruit, a good zing of acidity and a crisp aftertaste. Drink now, or age over the next year.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This is the best wine from Liberalia we've reviewed to date. Jammy blackberry, wild raspberry and licorice aromas are controlled but potent. Flush, dense and wide on the palate, this features manageable tannins along with pure blackberry and cassis flavors touched up by toasty oak. Espresso and burnt toast notes take over on the finish as the fruit slips away. Drink through 2030.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro

"Here's a gorgeous, delicious wine that's all about sheer elegance. It's loaded with alluring blue flower, creamy wild cherry and black raspberry sensations accented by notes of carob, clove and white pepper. This is impeccably balanced, with fresh acidity, silky, smooth tannins and a long, lingering finish. It already boasts great depth and complexity, but will continue to evolve for years.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nerello Mascalese
"Easy to see what the winemaker was aiming for with this Cabernet Sauvignon-based wine. Sheer opulence was the goal, and it succeeds. The wine is soft and gentle, with ultrarefined tannins and incredibly ripe, concentrated blackberry jam, blueberry, chocolate and sweet oak flavors. The alcohol is quite high, which gives it a glyceriney sweetness and also precludes aging. Drink now–2014.",US-California-Red Blend
"Blue flower, ripe black fruit, black pepper and cedar are just some of the aromas offered by this blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Sagrantino. The palate features ripe black cherry, coffee, espresso, vanilla and grilled sage alongside bracing tannins. Drink after 2016.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend

"This barrel-fermented white wine from Jesse Katz of Devil Proof and Aperture Wines is impressively layered and complex.

A bite of acidity supports its fresh, fruity core.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

"Drawn from Craggy's extensive holdings in Martinborough, this is a food-friendly Sauvignon Blanc. It doesn't push the herbal extremes of the variety but instead offers plenty of zesty citrus fruit tinged with snow pea, medium body and a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink it over the next year or so.",New Zealand-Martinborough-Sauvignon Blanc

"Marked by brisk, cutting acidity, this Chardonnay is bone dry, with a steely, stony cut of mineral that's relieved by lemon and lime flavors. It's a severe wine by itself, but it should be food friendly.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The winery held this Chardonnay back a year later than their far more expensive Journey bottling. Hard to say why, but the consumer is the beneficiary. That extra bit of aging has mellowed the wine, giving it a creamy, buttery richness. It has good acidity, too, that gives a lift to the ripe tropical fruits.",US-California-Chardonnay
"There's still a sharpness to this wine, even though it's nearly 4 years old. It shows good blackberry, currant and chocolate-covered cherry flavors, but also a greener streak of mint and oregano that probably limits its ageability.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"A very good interpretation of Sangiovese. A pretty sharp mouthfeel, but maybe that's to be expected from this high-acid variety. Otherwise, it's nice and dry, with complex cherry, red currant, licorice, leather and sandalwood flavors. Good with spicy beef, pork and veal dishes.",US-California-Sangiovese

"This perfumed wine has a rustic edge that should blow away as the wine matures. For the fruit, it is red-berry time: bright, soft and lifted by gentle tannins and lively acidity. The wine will improve for a few more months, so drink from late 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Pinot Noir

"The great 2002 vintage has produced some remarkable wines and this falls into that category. Still so fresh, with swathes of mineral texture and tight acidity, it is still developing.

The palate offers juniper, pine, loam and tea flavors against the bright red cherry fruit, with an encompassing acidity that is strong but not searing.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"One of the best value-priced, big and rich wines you're likely to find. The nose impresses with potent blackberry, cedar and marzipan aromas, and the palate bridges the gap between power and elegance. Tastes great, with herbal black cherry and cola leading the way. Very ripe but really well made.",Chile-Rapel Valley-Carmenère
"Dried cherries, cocoa dust, flinty gunmetal, worn leather and pressed rose petals show on the nose of this blend of Petite Sirah, Syrah and Grenache. The palate surrounds a dense core of minted blackberry fruit, with lifting dill and a chunk of fudge rounding out a very nice flavor set.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"The cave cooperative in Tavel is hitting on all cylinders, turning out numerous consistent, top-rated examples.

Drink now–2018.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"Plummy fruit aromas meet with nutmeg and vanilla on the pleasing if somewhat simple nose of this bottling. The palate grows much more interesting, lively and delicious, as rounded, juicy red fruits are cut by star anise and cinnamon flavors. A spicy acidity cuts through the elegant tannic structure.",US-California-Grenache
"A hint of peach on the still closed nose draws you in. The palate with its concentration of zesty citrus peel suggests that this might benefit from some bottle age, so that all that lovely peach and lemon can unfurl. This is sleek, concentrated and packs a punch. Drink 2017–2025 at least.",Austria-Kremstal-Riesling
"Compelling aromas of dry herbs blend with ripe berry, plum and leathery scents. This feels tight, juicy and ripped with raw, hard-pumping acidity.

A minty, lightly toasted and spicy finish provides a nice ending",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This is a blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Carignane and Alicante Bouschet. It's a lusty, full-bodied wine, rich and savory in cherries, licorice, bacon, cola and Indian spices, with a dry finish. A lovely wine for summer barbecue, or a cold weather beef stew.",US-California-Red Blend
"Bertani is Amarone's ultimate ambassador. This is a focused wine and has been carefully consistent over the years. Bertani has always portrayed appassimento—wine made from air-dried grapes—in the most sophisticated and elegant way. This expression shows exotic spice, dried fruit, cola and leather aromas. It could age for 10 years or more.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"

"Tastes more like a Zinfandel than a Cabernet, with a briary mouthfeel and flavors of black pepper and weedy green nettles. But there's lots of blackberry and black currant richness, and the wine is totally dry, with full-bodied, thick tannins. Unusual for a Cabernet, but a nice, complicated red wine for drinking with grilled meats.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas recall crushed raspberry, anisette, tilled earth and a whiff of cellar must. The soft palate doles out ripe black cherry, licorice and white pepper alongside polished tannins. It doesn't have much complexity but it's savory and already enjoyable. Drink through 2017.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"In this blend of Sangiovese, Teroldego, Barbera and Dolcetto, it's unclear whether the wine is better than the sum of its parts or a tangle of confused flavors. A mouth-puckering quality overrides all; the rest of the flavors tend toward sweet vanilla.",US-California-Red Blend

Now through 2013.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Gritty initial aromas of coffee grinds, balsamic vinegar and sassy berry fruits open this Cabernet-led blend that includes Petit Verdot, Carmenère and Cabernet Franc.

"Made entirely from Chardonnay, it shows real delicacy and richness, with a mousse as smooth as fine satin. Flavorwise, it's enormously rich, suggesting oranges, limes, honey, vanilla, toast and the sweet, yeasty doughiness of a brioche pastry. Really gorgeous, a worthy followup to the fabulous 2005 La Rêve.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"This is very sweet in honey flavor, with fruity notes of apricot and orange. It could benefit from greater acidity to balance the sweetness, but it sure is a decadent dessert sipper.",US-California-Riesling
"Despite heavy aromas of baked berry, prune and raisin, this is solid on the palate, with a firm grip. Flavors of earthy plum, tomato, red currant and herbs finish pure, tight and persistent.

"Features an admirably lean, elegantly fine line of acids from start to finish, off of which hang notes of crushed stone, green apple and lime, with just the merest hints of riper fruit, like nectarine.

"The nose is heady and fragrant, edged with dried chamomile and hay flowers and subdued honey. Underneath that is a notion of sweet, luscious apricot compote.

A triumph of balance and richness.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris

"This is dense and saturated, with crushed blackberry and plum aromas that turn more jammy and granular as the wine breathes.

"Crushed floral aromas, berry-infused tea and cherry candy aromas give this wine a sweet profile. The palate, however, is anything but. It pounds with toasty black fruit, licorice and fiery menthol.

"Muscular, mildly sweaty aromatics make this a little tough to get into, but the flavors are really elevated and complex. There's layered citrus, slate, licorice and spice all working together.

There's a strong blackberry-balsamic reduction flavor once sipped, as well as beef char, elderberry and more tar.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is one dense, saturated blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot. The nose is all black fruits and prune, while the palate runs deep and dense, but without a lot of finesse.

Drink through 2020.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Very light in the glass, this bottling is also delicate on the nose in terms of power. But it offers tons of action nonetheless, with fresh and dried herbs, flint and a tiny bit of smoke adding to the red-fruit aromas.

The wine conveys a balanced taste impression overall.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A big, syrupy five-grape blend that delivers the full allotment of baked, ripe berry aromas followed by a firm, tannic palate housing serious flavors of blackberry, eucalyptus, olive and mineral.

"With a very light, almost water-like color, this offers expectedly light aromas of honey and a tiny bit of nectarine flesh.

Altogether, it's quite interesting.",US-California-Grenache Blanc
"This Sémillon is quite dry, with an unusual mouthfeel that is a bit like chewing on beeswax, honeycomb without the sweetness of honey.

"This blush wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. As you'd expect, it's a big wine for a rosé, a little heavy, but there's a nice cut of acidity that helps. Is it dry?

"If all you're after is size, then sign on the dotted line. This blend is a monster that weighs in at 15.5%, so be ready for intensely sweet flavors of grape essence and licorice. To this judge, the wine has a lot of gumption but isn't what I'd want to drink glass after glass, day after day. It's lumbering, heavy but oh so sweet and dessert-like.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"Based in the northern Rhône, Chapoutier's Châteauneufs have not always been a strong suit, but the 2006 Barbe Rac rocks. Some stable-like notes on the nose add complexity to the bold cherry fruit, while stemmy, herbal notes bring even more nuance to the palate.

"The merest hint of reduction reminds you of how young this wine actually is. On the palate, a very generous full-fruited picture unfolds: there is very ripe juicy yellow pear and countless juicy citrus notions of clementine, tangerine, satsuma and orange. All of this is cut with precise, tart and ripe lemon freshness. This interplay of tart and ripe creates tension and drive. This is lovely now but is a powerhouse of potent long-lasting fruit.

"The heady aromatic scent of fresh tangerine peel takes turns with the refreshing perfume of green Seville oranges. The palate takes these enticing aromas and bundles them into one arrow-like force of concentrated freshness. This is a high-wire act of piercing brightness and layered citrus aroma. This is like a self-generating well of freshness that convinces with its luminosity, raciness and rapier-like purity of citrus flavors. Everything is heightened: Fruit, dryness, freshness and vibrant verve. It is tempting but it would be a shame to drink this now. Keep this genie in its bottle for a while longer, if only to see what fascinating direction it takes. This is wondrous. Drink 2022–2037.",France-Alsace-Riesling

"A cool-climate Pinot Gris, this is a finely tuned citrusy white, with crisp notes of peach and apricot. This is the winery's first release that's made from Marguerite Vineyard fruit. It spent no time in oak and malolactic fermentation was blocked, which helped to preserve an impressive amount of acidity.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"With rich melon aromas, ripe apple flavors and a soothing, almost soft texture, this wants some rich, sophisticated cooking to go with it, like sautéed fish with a classic French sauce. Subtle acidity keeps the notes of almond and apple lingering on the finish.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

"Aromatic and refreshing, with scents of white blossoms, stonefruits and a hint of beeswax, this is fermented entirely in stainless steel and meant to be enjoyed fresh and young.

Drink now until 2015–2016.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Hyde has figured into the producer's sparkling wine production for years, but this marks Davies' first release of still Pinot Noir from the stellar site.

A ripe trace of cherry and raspberry lurks along the background, peaking on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"From veteran winemaker John Glaetzer, this Cabernet from Langhorne Creek is something of a throwback, spending some 28 months in American oak hogsheads.

Drink 2010–2020.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon

It has pristine tannins and a good, dry mouthfeel, with very rich flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate and cedar that are grounded with notes of anise and sweet herbs. Very fine and dramatic, this 100% Cab should develop for at least the next eight years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"The aromas offer notes of vanilla, baking spice and tropical fruit. The flavors are light and restrained, pulling up slightly toward the finish.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"This is a rich, powerful wine. It is dense, with dusty tannins and great swathes of ripe black fruits. The acidity, crisp and generous at the same time, is well integrated with the fruit.

"Fresh-squeezed grapefruit, pomelo, Key lime, lemongrass, green papaya and Anjou pear combine for a very green, fruit-driven nose on this bottling from a vineyard just behind Pismo Beach. The palate is a tad ripe but shows apple soda, lime juice, cherimoya and apple-custard flavors.",US-California-Albariño

"Full of buttery, tropical flavors, it also has a barrel-infused taste of petroleum and char.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Rich and aromatic, with a full blast of fragrant toasty oak and plenty of tropical fruit. The apple, mango and pear fruit that coats your mouth is round and ripe but not too thick or grabby. And the finish is perfectly smooth. Sure, it's a bit buttery and full, so no one will confuse it for Chablis. But in its class it's one of the best out there.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"Gritty aromas of charred beef and tar lead to a tight, drawing palate with hard tannins. Balsamic flavors of roasted plum, blackberry and green herbs finish tight, grating and with residual tannic bite. If you know Chilean Carmenère, this fits the mold.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère

"Amazingly lush and delicious in blackberry and cherry pie, mocha and sweet new-oak flavors, this blend is also tannic to the point of being undrinkable at this time. You definitely want to give it until at least 2022 in the bottle.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Despite cool conditions in 2011, or quite possibly because of them, this is thriving. Aromas of cedar, earth, spice and berry fruits are stylish and comported.

Drink through 2026.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A rare 100% Petit Verdot, this is dense in red and black fruit, from plum and blueberry to blackberry, ripe enough to be in a cobbler. Cinnamon dusts the top, with a puff of smoke in the background.

"Elevates the Keller style of superripe, oaky Chardonnay into a more refined, balanced wine, equally rich but more perfect.

"Dense blueberry, concentrated purple flowers and a touch of tar show on the nose of this bottling of a fairly rare grape in the region. The palate intrigues with tar, beef crust and tart, tannic elderberry fruit, but it's quite wound up in a very solid structure that still needs time to unwind.",US-California-Malbec

Loud citrus and berry aromas precede an overloaded palate that carries stalky plum flavors. Pickled tasting on the finish.,Spain-Northern Spain-Rosé

"This is a concentrated, dark and brooding wine. Its complexity comes from the interplay of tannins and rich red fruits, laced with tight acidity. Serious and dense, it is a wine for long aging. Drink this impressive wine from 2019.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This riserva shows ripe aromas of plum and wild cherry accompanied by notes of underbrush and oak. It has lush black-cherry, raspberry, mint and cinnamon flavors, and hints of vanilla and chocolate. It's enjoyable now, thanks to the soft, round tannins and easygoing palate.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This special cuvée comes from the vineyards surrounding the Château de la Marquetterie in Reims. With a part aged in wood, the wine has fine bottle aging and toastiness giving it richness as well as bringing out the ripe lemon and red-apple flavors. It is a beautifully balanced wine that is ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Jammy, reduced aromas of cassis, blueberry and animal hide lead to a juicy, fresh palate that's not too thick or concentrated. Blackberry and blueberry flavors are lightly peppered, while the finish is quick and light for Malbec. This is a new wine that aims at freshness and simple fruit more than power and weight.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Thick in sandpapery tannins, this Petite Sirah shows very ripe, sweet flavors of blackberry jam, currants, chocolate, raisins and pepper. It's rustic now, and likely to remain so over a long lifespan.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Woodsy at first, then more foresty and stretched. The nose is peppery and light on fruit, while the palate shows tight cherry and raspberry flavors alongside edgy, invigorating tannins and acidity. A lively wine with bite and modest offsetting sweetness to the overriding snap.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Cherry, plum, bacon and licorice are all good aromas that indicate that this value wine has quality backing it up. The palate is fresh and clean, with depth and ripe, slightly oaked flavors of cassis, blackberry and chocolate. Easy to like, with toasty touches throughout.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lovely cinnamon-tinged blueberry and plum notes rise enticingly from the glass. The palate is firm and fresh, cracking with taut, ripe plum and cherry fruit. This is fresh-faced and honest red with just the right amount of grip and structure. The finish is beautifully clean.",Austria-Burgenland-Blaufränkisch
"This is quite a good Syrah that impresses all the way through. The first sniff is of a burst of white pepper, while the first sip assaults the palate, in a good way, with ripe blackberry, plum, mulberry and roasted meat flavors, and a sprinkling of cloves and anise. It's an upscale wine, but softness will limit ageability, so drink now through 2008.",US-California-Syrah
"This is the best Pinot Gris yet from Jones; the grapes were sourced from the 2 Gun Vineyard in the upcoming Ancient Lakes region—a future American Viticultural Area. Leesy and creamy, it seduces with a layer of rich cream wrapped around bright orange and semitropical fruit flavors. It's full and fresh, and it lingers.",US-Washington-Pinot Gris
"This impressive Barbaresco shows generous intensity and a very nice equilibrium between wild berry fruit and oak-driven tones of spice and tobacco. There's a fun touch of pepper and white truffle as well and the wine is compact, firm and elegant on the close.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
A faintly metallic flavor spoils this red fruited wine. It brings out tight acidity and red currant fruits while the structure is lost.,Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
"This inexpensive white wine does a good job of being dry and ultracrisp in acidity, which gets the mouth watering. It offers pleasant flavors of Lifesaver candy pineapples and lemons, with a hint of vanilla.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"Here's a blend of Friulano, Ribolla Gialla and Malvasia Istriana that shows easy fruit tones of stone fruit and melon backed by a waxy, slightly chewy feel in the mouth.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend
"Lots of characteristic Cabernet flavor in this wine. Blackberrry jam and cassis liqueur flavors flood the mouth, heady and flashy and long in the finish. The tannins are thick, yet so soft, you can enjoy this wine now, although it will develop over the next ten years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Mauve in color, this wine—an ode to Hearst Ranch architect Julia Morgan—shows strawberry pie and pink rose petals on the nose. Mouthwatering acidity on the palate is a touch boozy, with flavors of ripe strawberries, raspberries and lemon zest.",US-California-Rosé

"Boysenberry, cracked peppercorn and caramel frame the nose of this rich red. Although not particularly complex, lush flavors of berry juice and espresso on the palate prove rather tasty and enjoyable.",US-California-Merlot
"As is often the case with 100% Touriga Nacional, the wine is one-dimensional. It has perfumed fruit and tannins, but seems to have a hollow core. That's why blending can be a good idea.",Portugal-Tejo-Touriga Nacional
"Deep color, bold fruit aromas and substantial, spicy flavors lend significant power and concentration to this full-bodied wine. It's nearly dry, well structured and balanced, with appealing blackberry, nutmeg and cinnamon flavors.",US-California-Red Blend
"Big, bold and black in color, this wine is full of new wood perfumes, and it has a smooth, polished texture. Rich, fruity and firmly balanced, it has dark tannins that create a powerful structure. It offers some aging potential.",France-Southwest France-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Fresh and leesy, this stainless steel-fermented Pinot Gris spent six months on the lees, giving it extra freshness and texture. Sweet grass and fresh herbs spread nicely across the palate, and the 15% alcohol does not register as such. In fact, if anything, this seems to fall on the lighter side of Oregon Pinot Gris, without the thick and heavy fresh cut pear character that many of them bring. Pair this with chanterelles in a light cream sauce.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"The wine has plenty of ripe fruit, raspberry flavors and light spice. With a crisp streak of acidity, it is beginning to show a good balance. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This dry Riseling is richly mouthfilling and intensely mineral, with delicate stone-fruit flavors that mingle with notes of wax and orange rind. It's lush and full  bodied, but balanced with tart lemon acidity and a drying astringency on the finish.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Here's a sound, everyday-style Cabernet for drinking now. It's dry and tannic, with rich flavors of blackberries, black currants and plums, enhanced with sweet, smoky oak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A complex, ageworthy wine that combines contradictions but somehow is complete and wholesome. The cool vintage shows up in the form of green olives and sweet green peas, a taste that's unusual for Oakville but one that works well alongside the more traditional black currants and sweet oak. The tannins are pure Oakville, rich, ripe and dramatically layered. Beautiful in every respect, this 100% Cab will reward cellaring. Begin popping the cork in 2018.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Hints of sweaty saddle leather, cherries and dark chocolate mark the nose and palate of this wine. This medium-bodied wine doesn't show much in the way of tannins, making it easy to drink now and probably best drunk up before 2020.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Mulberries and exotic plums mix with river rocks and hibiscus flowers on the nose of this very quaffable and inviting bottling, one of the best in the winery's Grenache study. It's broad and playful on the palate with flavors that perfectly reflect the aromas. With a slight chill, this would be a great red for brunch.",US-California-Grenache
"A hint of brioche lends autolytic character to fresh spring blossom and lemon notes on this elegant, bristling traditional-method sparkling. It's delicately effervescent and startlingly brisk, finishing on a soft, rolling foam that deliciously lingers.",US-New York-Champagne Blend
"Aromas of Key lime skins and lemon bar cookies hide a slight but typical petrol note on this wine from the San Diego County-based producer. It's slightly sour on the citrusy palate, with balanced acidity and a chalky grip.",US-California-Riesling
"Plastic, rubber and latex aromas dominate the nose on this Carmenère. Tomatoey, cloying and tannic in the mouth, the palate tastes mostly of carob, oak and herbal berry fruits.",Chile-Rapel Valley-Carmenère
"Venturing into the orange side of the rosé color rainbow, this Mourvèdre-based wine—with 13% Grenache—brings melon, guava, pomelo and ripening banana to the nose, followed by papaya and watermelon once sipped. It's a revealing look at the potential of the overlooked Central Coast vineyards that winemaker Ian Brand diligently seeks out, both for his personal labels and the many for which he consults.",US-California-Mourvèdre
"This delicious blend of Alvarinho and Trajadura comes from the northern part of the Vinho Verde region. The flavors are ripe yet crisp, with notes of apple and pink grapefruit. The acidity is prominent, yet well integrated into the rich fruitiness. Drink now.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White

"The new Oregon project from John Abbott (ex-Abeja) kicks off with this vineyard selection from a five-star vintage. A blend of fifth leaf Pommard and 30-year-old Wädenswil clones, it's lush and aromatic, sporting bold scents and flavors of ripe raspberry and cherry fruit, with a spine of iron. Toasty new barrel accents punch through, with a clean crisply defined finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"Rich and delicious, this has flavors of pineapple tart, lemon meringue pie, buttered toast and smoky butterscotch that are balanced by fine acidity and dry, firm minerality.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Not quite ripe, with an herbal, almost vegetal taste that cuts across the cherries and red currants. Acidic and tannic, too. This hard, austere wine is unlikely to improve.",US-California-Red Blend
"A good wine. It's a little tough and gritty in texture, but shows ripe flavors of black currants, mocha and spices. Finishes sweet and tannic, but not an ager.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Yellow fruits lead off this sophisticated wine. With its creamy texture, overlaid by a more steely texture, it's a wine that has aging potential as well as present fruitiness for early drinking. So age for four years or give in to the freshness now. Screwcap.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"This leads with vibrant and fresh aromas, recalling cut grass, herbs, lime zest and citrus, with whiffs of tropical fruit. The palate brings tart, zingy, mouthwatering citrus flavors, with a lightly creamy feel on the finish.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc

"A very closed nose on the palate gives way to zesty citrus notes on a very refreshing, clean and slender palate. With some probing, a little textural spice shows and leads to a fuller notion of lemon and grapefruit zest. The finish is fresh and clean and suggests the merest hint of pear.",Austria-Traisental-Grüner Veltliner
"This is a structured dry wine that has spice, toast and solid tannins. Initially showing too much extraction, it does then open out to the ripe fruits and black-currant flavors. Wait until 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Still so young, this is a dense, hugely concentrated black-colored wine, dark with tannins and rich with powerful black plum and damson fruits. Powered and very ageworthy, it will be best drunk from 2020. The wine takes its name from the Zero Longitude Greenwich meridian that passes through the vineyard.",France-Southwest France-Tannat
"This is a superior vintage Champagne that is just beginning to mature. Crisp white and citrus fruits are beginning to fade into mature toast and cookie flavors, but the wine maintains its zesty texture. Drink this wine now, but beware the cork is secured precariously with string that must be cut to open.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This is a lovely rendering of Syrah from this outstanding Walla Walla vineyard. In terms of depth of flavor and range of detail, it's a fascinating wine sure to provide an evening's pleasure. Sassafras, spiced and cured meat, licorice, espresso, black cherry and cassis whirl through the palate, with excellent concentration and length.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This is a supple, creamy-textured Shiraz to enjoy through 2020. Red-fruit notes of strawberry and raspberry marry easily with dark hints of plum and mocha, then linger gently on the finish.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
The flower and peach aromas are quite subdued for the variety. The stone-fruit flavors provide more generosity while still displaying elegance.,US-Washington-Viognier
"The beautiful perfume that unites tangerine peel and apple, lemon and blossom makes for an inviting nose. The palate brims with the same generous and utterly fruit-driven flavors. This is Riesling at its most charming. The finish is off dry, but all the more fruit driven for that.",France-Alsace-Riesling
Whiffs of blossoms accent aromas of fresh apples and dusty minerals on this semi-sweet Riesling. It dances nervously on the palate with pretty white peach and floral notes accented with a streak of puckery lemon-lime acidity. Finishes with a hint of savory dried herbs.,US-New York-Riesling
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, this wine is aromatically brooding, with notes of pencil lead, barrel spice, herb, medicine cabinet and cherry. The flavors are rich and full bodied, showing concentration and depth.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This 70-30 blend of Nero di Troia and Montepulciano shares some characteristics of a deeply extracted Cabernet Sauvignon. The aromas are thick and penetrating but also have green accents of sage and chopped herbs. It's a nervous, edgy wine that also pulls off opulence and sophistication.",Italy-Southern Italy-Red Blend
"Passoro opens with an amber, almost deep orange color and overripe aromas of sun baked raisins, dried apricot, strawberry jam and candied fruit. The wine feels heavy and thick on the mouth but a sharp point of lemon zest appears at the very end.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Moscato
"Hot, salty popcorn, pan-fried apples and melting butter show the oak but in a judicious manner. Flavors of lemon are layered over poached apples, all presented with a mouth-enlivening acidity, and culminating with a touch of vanilla bean on the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A rich wine that is made by the Abreu Callado charity foundation. It has dark black currant fruits, big tannins and an elegant feel. With its structure, minerality and ripe, juicy fruitiness, it is finely structured and ageworthy. Drink from 2017.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"This leads with herb, vanilla and plum aromas, along with a reduced note of tire rubber. On the palate, sweet plum flavors are backed by gritty tannins, proving somewhat disjointed.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Oak dominates, with a powerful taste of caramel and char flattening the underlying fruit. The basic wine seems to be pretty good, with crisp acidity and mineral and pineapple flavors. But all that oak is heavy-handed and unnecessary.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a sweet, very perfumed wine with pleasant candy flavors. Rich rosewater and spice notes add complexity, and chalk soils lend a crisp edge that cuts into the opulent character of the wine. It could age, not for long, so drink until 2018.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"An exotic nose of spiced pears and white pepper with butter undertones makes for an eye-opening start. Made in a more luxuriant style than many Gavi, it shows a bit of texture on the palate and finishes with flavors of green plums, freshly cut grass and lychee. Drink up.",Italy-Piedmont-Cortese
"This is a good example of a red Portuguese wine, showcasing soft, generous tannins and juicy red and blackberry fruits. It is ripe, full of fruit and rounded with a firm, dry aftertaste. Drink now.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese Red

"Here's a modern and beautiful wine with warming tones of vanilla, spice, chocolate and blackberry. The wine is thick and dense with dark extraction and very solid tannins. Drink after 2010. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"The Ursa blend is about 40% each of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon filling out the rest. Unsurprisingly, there is a forceful streak of herbal flavors running through this wine. It's more focused on the palate than the Star, with riper flavors of blackberry and bramble, albeit with plenty of pepper and stem.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is wonderfully rich and dense, with dry and dusty tannins that float in the depths of the powerful black fruits, well integrated with the wood. This is impressive Malbec, showing its juicy qualities allied with its huge tannins. It could do with 3–4 years' aging.",France-Southwest France-Malbec

It is pleasant on the palate from start to finish, with velvety tannins supporting flavors of black cherry, blueberry, vanilla, star anise and lavender that slowly drift off into closing notes of floral spice.",Israel-Judean Hills-Red Blend
"The newest release of Bellissima Rossa—a blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot and 23% Cabernet Franc—is just a bit brighter, more spicy and peppery than the previous vintage. It's built upon bright, racy fruit, and uses the barrels moderately. The length seems a bit better than the 2005, but mostly it's the butterscotchy barrel flavors that linger sensuously in the back of the throat.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Light, tart and carrying its cherry, pomegranate and cranberry fruit with precision, this lovely bottle will satisfy those who like their fruit upfront, and also those who want some substance on the back end. Pleasing roasted coffee and chocolate streaks reflect the aging for over 10 months in French oak (30% new). There's a well-managed earthy note also, adding depth and interest.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Already impressive, this wine shows great fruit for the vintage as well as structure. Ripe with black cherries and berries, it has all of Pinot Noir's rich juiciness, but hints of smoke add complexity as well. Structured and a shade dark, it needs time to mature. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir

"Almost impossible to distinguish this nice and easy Garnacha from the winery's Monte Oton label (also rated 89). Open berry and jam aromas keep it together, while the saturated, sweet blackberry palate is living proof of Campo de Borja's sun and terroir. Ripe, deep and easy to enjoy.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"An herbal edge of lemon balm plays amidst the citrus and pineapple-scented nose of this immensely concentrated Riesling. Pleasantly bitter notes of apple and pear peel add an earthy quality and a firm structure that allows citrus aromas of lemon zest, pink grapefruit and tangerine peel to soar.",Austria-Kremstal-Riesling
"A wonderful, amazingly rewarding wine, certainly one of California's best Albariños. If there's any oak at all, it's insignificant. What stars is brilliant Edna Valley acidity and racy flavors of citrus fruits, pears, white flowers and white peppery spices. The perfect cocktail wine.",US-California-Albariño
"Ripe, cool, earthy black-fruit aromas of plum and cassis are accented by notes of leather and animal. This warm-vintage Rioja feels chunky and good, while ripe, loamy flavors of black plum and cassis finish mellow and with a touch of oak-based lemon peel. Drink through 2021.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend

"Dauzac, whose vineyards are in the south of Margaux, has produced a severe wine in 2010, full of impressive tannins. It is not without charm, however, and it will certainly fill out its serious structure over the next several years. Give this dense wine time.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Light fruit flavors of apple and pear have been softened a bit with aging on the lees in neutral oak. This is a pleasant, simple, quaffable wine for every day enjoyment.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay

"Packed with black-cherry flavors, this is a structured wine. Its acidity chimes well with the mineral texture and tangy black-currant and berry flavors. The wine is fruity while still firm and likely to age. Drink from mid-2016.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"A multiple vineyard blend, this includes 10% Merlot, which seems to open up the middle a bit.

There is a high-toned spicy quality to the aromas, just a hint of volatility, but well-managed.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Perfumed oak and funky earthiness permeate the nose and palate of this wine, with punchy cedar and bay notes. It lingers long on forest floor, pine and other woodsy components through its medium-bodied ripeness and structure.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Much lighter than the winery's other bottling of this level, this wine shows cranberry, light olive and the slightest hint of eucalyptus on the nose. Cranberry, black pepper, pencil lead and earth show on the palate, which makes for a very nice wine, just not quite as stunning as the Bien Nacido version.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A superripe structured wine that has serious tannins and a smoky dark character. Right now, the tannins dominate the otherwise fruity wine, but with some time it will soften and balance out. Drink this powerful wine from 2024.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Black cherry, plum and currant aromas are young, bouncy and fresh as a whole. That pretty much describes the palate on this Garnacha-led blend: It's lively, rubbery, tannic and fresh. Blackberry, plum and black currant flavors finish tannic and grabby. Drink through 2017.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Rounded, and rich, this is touched with spicy wood and has plenty of black berry fruits. A solid structure, some fruit tannin and plenty of red-plum-skin edge finishes ripe.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay

"This full-bodied wine demonstrates the jammy side of Volnay. It is rich and dense, and it has a delicious berry flavor. In the process of all this generosity, the tannins are lost, so drink it over the next few years.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir

"While plush blackberry, dried fig and cherry aromas are rich and ripe on the nose, this voluptuous Cab is surprisingly structured and taut on the palate.

Glimpses of ripe pear and honeycomb show on the edges, while the medium-dry finish is immensely appetizing. Though it's lovely now, it shows long-term potential, and should hold well through 2030.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"This is the perfect wine for washing down pasta salad and easy dishes. Peach, citrus and pink grapefruit are delivered in measured doses and the wine is light and lean in the mouth with a brilliant sparkle of acidity on the close.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Steeped plum, exotic spice, crushed mint and underbrush aromas take center stage. The palate is still youthfully austere, offering dried cherry, star anise and pipe tobacco framed in firm fine-grained tannins. Give it time to fully bloom. Drink after 2022.",Italy-Central Italy-Sagrantino
"Currant, cola, spice and cherry lead this layered Cab from Delfosse. It's an approachable style but with added character: cinnamon spice, tobacco and black cherry on the palate is integrated and smooth. An elegant wine with ageable chops.",US-Virginia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Although it's a little slender and simple, it's good for the price and offers pleasant cherry and spice flavors that finish dry.",US-California-Merlot
"Smoked meat, olives and mushroom lend a distinctly rustic flair to this late-release Merlot. Blackberry and cherry flavors are pristine and concentrated, but accented by hints of barnyard and astringent tannins that linger on the finish. Drink now through 2017.",US-New York-Merlot
"Dark richness and ruby extraction give this Barbaresco a very beautiful appearance. The bouquet offers bold aromas of raw cherry, spice and leather. The wine closes with a succulent, fruit-driven finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"From yet another block of the Frediani Vineyard, a favorite source of the producer, Rosedale is juicy in plum ripeness and soft texture. An easygoing expression of a warm-climate red, it's structured and succulent.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Although the wine is labeled a Vineyard Designate, it's a blend of multiple vineyards. Dry, fairly full-bodied and tannic, it has complex cherry, currant, licorice and sandalwood flavors. Drinkable now, it will benefit by waiting until 2017 in the cellar.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Though fairly light in color, the aromas on this single-vineyard wine are quite dark and meaty: dried mushroom, dried cherry, even beef jerky. Once sipped, macerated cherry, chai, black tea and espresso combine into a soft, expressive mouthfeel that finishes with tart cranberry.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Saucy blueberry aromas are a touch muddled and difficult to decipher, while this Garnacha feels medium in body and healthy. Raspberry and plum flavors come with a resiny, pasty oak note, while medicinality rises up on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"Drunken peach, green apple, gray slate and rounded butter notes hit the nose. There is a baking soda minerality on the palate, some sea salt and a tongue-tingling acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This bottling from a region northeast of San Diego is almost austere at first, but then restrained aromas of candied nuts and ripe pears show on the nose. The palate is also well-restrained for this often unctuous grape, especially coming from a warmer region, with flavors of kaffir lime, citrus pith, nectarine, melon and guava.",US-California-Roussanne
"Traditionally, Prosecco sparkling wines were executed in a dry style, which means they have enough sweetness to change the aromatic profile and softness of the mouthfeel. Indeed, fresh peach and apricot emerge from the bouquet and the wine feels round and creamy overall.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"This is a wine with presence, from its meaty, spicy nose to its big, full-flavored fruit and spice character. Many layers of spice, smoke and berry unfold on the palate and the overall impression is delicious and serious. It lacks a touch of refinement, but is still a very good, ageable selection.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Red Blend
"Dr. Loosen offers a solid value in this remarkably well-priced eiswein. It's enticing on the nose, with aromas of honey, saffron and a dark, dusty mineral tone. Rich and silky in texture, it's concentrated and lively on the palate, with intense flavors of lemon and peach. Finishes with a tinge of tea and spicy orange rind. It's delicious now, but should develop well through 2020.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Cab Franc is often a high point in lineups of red wines from the Rogue Valley, but this one misses the mark. A sweaty nose gets it off to a rough start, and the flavors of stems and green tannins do nothing to help the tart generic fruit. It might slip comfortably into a flight of budget Bordeaux from a cool year.",US-Oregon-Cabernet Franc
"Thin and dry, this wine has Pinot's silky mouthfeel, but little else. The mushroom, cola and spearmint flavors are relieved by some cherry fruit. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This pretty Rosso di Montalcino opens with a concentrated appearance and aromas of ripe fruit, spice, toasted nut and dried rosemary. A bit thin on the finish, the wine concludes with silky tannins and a fresh touch.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Properly rich and majestic, this wine also has impressive amounts of crisp acidity to balance its concentration. The wine has layers of peach and apricot along with beautiful acidity and a taut texture that will allow it to age. It is generous and will become opulent and full bodied as it develops. Drink this powerful wine from 2022.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This is the prototype for an over-the-top, roasted, charred Tempranillo. The nose smells directly of burnt coffee, charcoal and grilled beef. It's super-chunky on the tongue, with dominating roasted black fruit flavors. It has its merits but is still too blackened for our liking.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"From a producer with a proven track record for Rhône wines comes this powerful, dramatically structured 100% Grenache. Shows the variety's lush cherry flavors, with complex layers of grilled meat, dark chocolate, black licorice, violets and peppery spice. A bit hard and closed in tannins, it should be given a good decanting.",US-California-Grenache
"Fresh and fruity, the wine is ripe, soft and with attractive red berry fruits over acidity. Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon make a happy blend of fruit and gentle structure. Drink now.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
Soft strawberry and blossom make for a scented nose. The very frothy palate adds a slightly bitter note but compensates with lots of lemony freshness and a light-footed agile body that leaves you very refreshed. The finish is dry and the fizz is exuberant.,Austria-Österreichischer Sekt-Sparkling Blend
"Light apple and Anjou pear aromas, tangy fruit flavors shaded by butter and almond, and a supple texture add up to a sleek and flavorful wine. This is balanced, medium bodied and reflects the house style of Navarro that ensures a svelte mouthfeel with no rough edges.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Made from 100% Merlot grapes, this boasts ripe red berry, cassis, espresso, vanilla and chopped mint aromas. The densely concentrated palate doles out ripe cassis, licorice, tobacco and sage flavors, blanketed in velvety tannins. Drink through 2022.",Italy-Tuscany-Merlot
"Located north of Margaux village, Deyrem Valentin is a small, family-owned property of 32 acres that represents one of the values of Margaux. This wine is smooth, polished and concentrated, with flavors of wood and a sweet-tasting blackberry. The acidity and tannins demonstrate a fine balancing act. This shows good aging potential.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Tomato, savory spice and earthy, mildly stewed red-fruit aromas lead to a crisp palate with firm acids and flavors of tomato, raspberry, herbs, vanilla and dried cheese. Lasting but light on the finish. Contains 30% Gracianio, which helps explain the sheer, red-fruit character.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Though Viognier only makes up 1% of this wine, it substantially lifts the aromas, which bring notes of wild flowers along with blue and black fruit. The flavors are bold and full bodied, pulling no punches but showing exquisite concentration and length.",US-Washington-Syrah
"There are big tannins here on this rich, powerful wine, warm and ripe. There is a dry core, giving a dark, youthful herbal character, and the tannins along with final acidity. Although it is ready to drink, it also promises many years of aging.",Portugal-Port-Port
"89-91 Herbaceous and fresh, the wine has a grassy character with a citrus edge, spice and grapefruit. It is lively and refreshing.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"The core aroma on this semisweet Sherry is maple syrup, but overall the nose is fresh and vital. Although creamy, this is balanced as a whole. Flavors of mixed nuts and toffee are familiar, while the finish hums along with no faults or bumps.",Spain-Andalucia-Sherry
"Part of a Limited Release series, this Syrah is made from fruit that was sourced from the Wahluke Slope, and it's co-fermented with 5% Viognier. Solid and substantial, it offers clear flavors of coffee, licorice, herb and earth, plus a deep, saturated note of blackberry syrup. A touch of dark chocolate infuses the finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"A pretty good Chardonnay, dry and crisp and minerally. It comes from this famous vineyard in the heart of the southern valley, and shows proper flavors of green apples and peaches, with a firm minerality and fine acidity. Not particularly rich, but interesting and complex, and a good companion to food.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A pretty good Syrah, a little rough-hewn around the edges, but solid in its dry fruitiness. With below 14% of alcohol, it shows flavors of blackberry and cherry liqueur, cola, tobacco and peppery spices.",US-California-Syrah
"Ripe tropical fruits dominate this warm, soft Sauvignon Blanc. The wine has a herbaceous element reinforced with acidity and a peach flavor. Ready to drink, but it could age for another year.",France-Bordeaux-Sauvignon Blanc
"Classic Howell Mountain Cabernet. The fruit is intense and concentrated in black currants and cocoa, the tannins are strong and hard, the acidity is perfect, the finish is entirely dry, and there's a firm minerality. So deliciously elegant now, it's hard to resist, but this Cab will surely reward cellaring through at least 2017.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Seems confected, with sweet Jolly Rancher aromas playing against taut acidity. A light, tart offering best paired with tomato-based sauces—fine with spaghetti at your local Italian joint.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"The high proportion in the blend gives it its ripe, juicy character. The toasty wood aging flavors are just enough to allow it to fill out as it ages. With juicy black-currant and ripe-berry flavors, the wine will be perfumed and delicious from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This 100% varietal wine sees a hearty dose of new oak and is built for the long term. It leans classic in its elegant layers of dried herb, red currant and pomegranate flavor. Boldly structured, it pleases rather than challenges the palate.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sweet and lithe, this is a wonderfully clean and pure expression of Riesling eiswein. There's no botrytis, only sweet pineapple, apple and citrus flavors that finish on lingering notes of orange and lemon. This should last a while in the cellar, but there's really no reason to delay gratification.",Germany-Mosel-Saar-Ruwer-Riesling
"An entry-level label for Coriole, the 2005 Redstone Shiraz features slightly earthy aromas combined with scents of dusty wood and modest blackberries. The tannins are a bit gripping on the finish; this wine might benefit from a year or two of bottle age.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"A Petite Sirah abundant in black pepper and cinnamon spice, structured, ripe and leathery. The tannins show promise for aging 5–7 years, the wine's black fruit waiting to burst forth.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Lemon plays on the nose alongside hints of shortbread. The palate has a lovely rich creaminess and very fine elegant mousse, creating an impression of light-bodied richness. This is sophisticated and dry, elegant and creamy—very grown-up and utterly delicious.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"An amazing wine, so rich and unctuous it's like a late harvest dessert wine. May even have a little botrytis in the intense pear, banana and tropical fruit flavors, but it's really very dry. A whole lot of sweet oak pushes the volume even higher.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Loimer's classic Grüner is delightfully cool, a green apple- and pear-flavored wine, very pure, crisp and layered with intense acidity. The edge is decidedly green, but there is plenty of creamy texture along the way. Screwcap.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"This is an unsually firm and tannic wine for the varietal, and it will be great to pair with a juicy steak or fresh-baked lasagna. It smells like cedar and cinnamon, tastes fresh but not overly fruity, and has an appetizing texture.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A clean, brisk Chardonnay made from this small, cool part of Monterey County's Salinas Valley. Shows its region's bright acidity, and also its long hangtime flavors of pineapples, peaches, green apples, limes and minerals. Nothing fancy or showy, just a really nice Chard at a fair price.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a light-colored wine with warm raspberry flavors and attractive acidity. Well balanced, it has a tangy orange-zest texture along with an herbal aftertaste. Drink this attractive wine now.",France-Provence-Rosé
"The vineyard is owned by the Farrells, and is located in the Green Valley, the coolest section of Russian River. The wine is very bright in acidity and clean and clear in minerals, with notes of tart lemondrop, brioche and Asian pear. Lees add a distinct taste of yeast and a rich, creamy texture. Perfect with cracked crab.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This Chianti Classico is composed of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot. This last variety really shines through, rendering jammy aromas of cherry and blackberry followed by dense, chewy fruit.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"From the producer's estate vineyard, adjacent to a successful dairy farm it also runs, this tiny offering comes from four specific blocks across the property, and is a seductive, juicy, well-composed wine. Lush and oaky, it conveys a density of forest floor, complemented by raspberry and strawberry, before finishing robustly in spice and mushroom.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Made from 100% Cab, this wine pours inky black, and feels softly ripe in the mouth, with pie-filling blackberries, cherries, mocha, plums, tobacco and sweet dusty spices. Shows a tannic astringency that strongly suggests cellaring, although it's flashy now. Best after 2011 and beyond.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A blend of seven vineyards scattered across the valley, this is a full-bodied, ripe Pinot Noir whose tannins suggest cellaring. Thoroughly dry, it shows deep notes of blackberries, black cherries, clove and pepper spice and smoky, vanilla-scented sandalwood. Feels elegant. Give it until 2013, at least.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"With ripe blackberry and cherry flavors, the fruit of this dry wine stands out, making it enjoyable despite very tough tannins that currently make it astringently sandpapery. A good effort, although the challenge for Unti is to tame those fierce tannins.",US-California-Syrah
"There is a touch of nuttiness on the nose before lemon notes kick in. There is lots of rounded spice, including hints of nutmeg and mace, that dance with the subtle lemony freshness on the light-bodied palate. The flavors are intriguing and very fresh, with a juicy, enlivening and still spicy finish.",France-Alsace-Sylvaner
"Crossfork Creek is a new label for Sheridan Vineyard, designed, says winemaker Scott Greer, as his laboratory for vinous experimentation. This meaty, smoky, dense and chewy Syrah is one of the first releases. The black cherry and cassis flavors are accented with a touch of cola, and the wine resolves with a firm, substantial and somewhat tannic finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
Subtle aromas of dark fruit and leather give this wine a measured and timid first approach. The intensity builds with each swirl of the glass and the wine shows that typical Sangiovese Grosso tightness and acidity on the close.,Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"The aromatics jump out, an intriguing mix of cherry fruit, leather, coffee and mocha. This is a block selection, and as such it is both precise and also a bit wanting in the midpalate. With ample aeration it fills in, finishing with dark fruit, roasted tannins and a little heat.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Pieluni Riserva is a superdense and rich expression of Montepulciano that could use another 3–5 years of aging. Oak spice aromas (the wine aged in French barrique for 18 months) are evident and will relax with time, ulimately revealing black fruit, cassis and sweet cinnamon spice.",Italy-Central Italy-Montepulciano
"Half of this Bordeaux-style blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, the other half a blend of Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. Pretty cherry fruit and sweet oak flavors are the two main threads here, but they have yet to meld together into a seamless whole. The wine opens with plenty of black cherry flavor, then hits a wall of tannin and astringent dried wood.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This Rhône blend offers dried red cherry, boysenberry and rose petals on the inviting nose. The Grenache is a powerful player, contributing a rosewater touch to the palate, alongside cranberry, caramel and a touch of cola.",US-California-G-S-M
"Structured and tight, this mineral-driven wine is still in its initial stages of development. It has crisp acidity, layers of spicy wood and a rich palate. Apples and white peach emerge from the firm, young structure. Drink this wine from 2018. The vineyard is next door to the Grand Cru Montrachet vines.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"There is a fine mineral-driven backbone to this ripe, concentrated and fruity wine, which gives its dense apricot and pineapple flavors great structure. It needs to age for at least four years.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A wine that is finely balanced, poised between an herbaceous character and riper fruits and lively acidity. This is a wine to drink young and fresh.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This Tuscan Merlot shows unripe aromas of green herb and olive backed by a raw, sharp feel. It does offer bright acidity on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Merlot
"This is so fruity with its blend of Grolleau and Cabernet Franc. It is off dry, full of strawberry flavors and laced with acidity. It is a fine summer rosé.",France-Loire Valley-Rosé
This very earthy wine with a barnyard character has lost its fruit. It does have structure but it is not likely to lose its animal edge.,France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Intoxicating aromas of plum jelly, violets, blueberry, chocolate and cinnamon are cut with a pencil-lead focus on this bottling by a family in the Paso wine game since 1908. Flavors of blackberry jelly are lifted by lavender and anise spice.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A surprisingly ripe wine from this generally cool vineyard, it shows notes of toast, buttery spice, vanilla and tropical fruit. It's medium-plus bodied, creamy in feel with a tart finish.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"An appealing wine with notes of coffee, blueberry and plum, with the aromas giving a suggestion of confection. The palate doesn't hang together end to end but it still provides plenty of enjoyment.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is intriguing on the nose, with loads of fresh apple and floral perfume merged with darker tones of petrol and pine needles. Off-dry in style, it's lush and fruity, with ample melon and stone-fruit flavors. It finishes dry, with a splash of citrusy acidity.",US-New York-Riesling
"Made in a style that will appeal to fans of both creamy, fruity richness and more austere notes of fresh grass, this wine is dry, herbal and juicy. It offers accents of vanilla and white plum, as well as the aforementioned fruitiness of peach and pear.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This vintage of San Rustico's Amarone seems more closed and reserved compared to last year. You'll get broad spice aromas and ripe cherry fruit, but the estate's characteristic intensity is less evident. It's an easy and genuine wine overall that will pair with lamb or pork.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Briny cidery aromas are fortunately not that loud or intense. This is wide and generous on the palate, with dry briny stone-fruit and apple flavors. A sense of dryness and pickle brine is amplified on a purposeful finish.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"This wine is balanced between fresh acidity and ripe apricot and pear flavors. It is textured, showing a light minerality but not enough to mask the fruits. Drink from 2017. Denis Dubourdieu and Christophe Ollivier consult with manager Philippe Lacoste for the Beraud-Sudreau family.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Somewhat unusual for the appellation, this wine doesn't include any Syrah; the blend is 80% Grenache and 20% Carignan. This medium- to full-bodied wine offers hints of Mexican chocolate, ripe black cherries and dried herbs backed by a smooth, silky, long finish. Drink now–2022.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Aromas suggest toasted oak, espresso, roasted coffee bean and mocha. The warm, concentrated palate offers prune, cherry steeped in spirits, allspice and oak extract alongside assertive tannins, with the heat of alcohol on the midpalate. The fruit richness is drying up fast so drink soon.",Italy-Southern Italy-Negroamaro
"A concentrated, inky black wine with woodshop tones that are still very evident. Let this wine settle five years to allow for prettier spice tones and more delicacy in terms of its fruit. This is a big chewy wine at this stage with blockbuster tannins. Drink after 2015.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"A lightly creamy rosé, this wine merely hints at, rather than broadcasts, its component flavors. Everything is in balance, but oddly pale—the fruit could be anything, and the wine itself seems a bit dumbed down. But nothing is off, and it finishes spicy and refreshing.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"The aromas don't hold back, with strong varietal notes of jalapeño and freshly cut green pepper along with cherry and hot-spice accents. The palate brings more of the same with light, tart, bright fruit flavors. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best.",US-Washington-Carmenère
"A very rich, opulent white wine, made from 100% of this rare Rhône variety. Brims with spicy tangerine marmalade flavors, with the vanilla and smoky caramel from ten months in French oak. A brisk spine of acidity provides clean balance to the richness.",US-California-Grenache Blanc
"This is nicely dry and rich in fine tannins, with classic Cabernet blackberry, black currant, cola and cedar flavors. But the wine is so soft, it lacks structural integrity.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lakewood hits the mark with this affordable Cabernet Franc. Earthy, attractive aromas of spice and pepper unfold into flavors of raspberry, cherry and more pepper. The wine has depth and weight without being heavy, thanks to a decent amount of acid. The finish is slightly weak but overall, a good wine and friendly.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"Hailing from a separate domaine whose wines are bottled by Henri Bourgeois, this is a soft, fruity wine. It has attractive citrus and pear flavors—a combination that gives both crispness and a rounded texture. Age for a year.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"BIg, bold and ripe, this wine has juicy blackberry flavors, sweet tannins and layers of refreshing acidity. With everything so vivid at the moment, it's obvious it needs time. You could give it 4–5 years in the cellar, although if fruitiness is your pleasure, then drink this wine sooner.",Austria-Burgenland-Blaufränkisch
"Lemon peel, wet clay, sandalwood and nutmeg aromas are inviting. In the mouth, it's tight and tannic, but lively, with leather and roasted berry flavors. Finishes firm, tight and a bit clipped and choppy. A reflection of 2008's tough conditions.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Although it's a fairly direct wine, this Pinot shows the Central Coast character that makes this cool-climate region so friendly to the variety. Translucent ruby in color, dry and silky in texture, it has crisp flavors of cherries, cola, licorice and Asian spices.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The winery has been quietly building up a solid track record with this bottling, and with the 2009, they've produced their best yet. The wine is gigantic in every respect. Vast, deep flavors of roasted coffee bean, blackberry, currant, violets and dark chocolate are complex, with plenty of toasted oak in the bargain. The tannins are strong, strong, strong, numbing the palate. While nobody can assure you it has a longterm future, this should evolve nicely with time; drink through 2022.",US-California-Syrah
"A firmly tannic wine, bringing out its cool climate origin. But the wine does have weight and the potential for showing black fruits and dark-plum skins, as well as a dry character. Keep for another year.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese Red
"Camastra is a 60-40 blend of Nero d'Avola and Merlot from Tenuta Regaleali that delivers distinct aromas of blackberry fruit, leafy vegetable, green pepper, cherry and moist earth. The wine is firm and black in concentration with a high quality of tannin.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"Lovely aromatics introduce this approachable young Pinot. Scents and flavors of strawberries, raspberries and cherries abound, coming into focus in a generous midpalate. The flavors hang on beautifully, set against framing tannins and supporting acidity. The finish brings a pretty touch of baking spices.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Starts with a nice gold-straw color and lots of fine, tiny bubbles. The aroma is rich and creamy, marked by pear and apple notes, vanilla and bread dough. Very dry, with evident ripe fruit and a dry, leesy finish. The texture’s a bit rough, but this may age out in a few years.",US-California-Champagne Blend
"Chardonnay lovers with a penchant towards rich, buttery wines spiced with cinnamon and vanilla will appreciate this unabashedly oaky yet neatly balanced wine. It's enticingly creamy on the palate, but sunny streaks of Meyer-lemon acidity lend refreshment. Drink now–2018.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Made from 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% other Bordeaux varieties, this wine offers simple dark cherry fruit and chewy tannins, the oak firm and supportive, with a finishing touch of tobacco.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This smoky, dusty wine seems to be chugging quickly along the aging curve. At the moment, it's drinking nicely, decked out with pretty baking spice and mocha highlights. It's smooth and mouth filling, with lots of pretty cherry flavor.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A surprisingly poor showing from this normally reliable winery, the 2000 Classico, a blend of Pinot Bianco, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, shows some lemony aromas, a plump, custardy mouthfeel and a tangy finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend
"Hartford's blended Zin is filled with exuberant aromas of jammy “Zinberry” fruit, baking spices like cinnamon and clove, bittersweet chocolate and black pepper. The vibrant mixed-berry flavors are rich and satisfying, finishing with a touch of warmth and softness.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This has fresh acidity, making it very enjoyable. It has prune, raisin, tobacco leaf and graphite aromas, with a whiff of leather. The palate delivers flavors of blackberry, clove, orange peel and spirit-soaked cherries. It's not overly complex, but it's delicious.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"This is a gorgeous wine, blended with 8% Merlot, 1% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec, and aged entirely in new French oak. Juicy waves of cassis and red currant are accented by dark chocolate, ultimately showcasing a lush, plush yet structured palate. It's decadent now, but should age well through 2022.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Attractive spice and green-fruit aromas lead to this fresh, ripe wine. Touches of wood give a spicy buttery taste that contrasts easily with the flavors. Fruity with a light mineral character, it is ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This Merlot has small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petite Sirah. It's fairly tannic, with a trace of stewy greenness in the background.",US-California-Merlot
"The right elements are here and show on the nose-berry/plum, a touch of earth and leather. On the palate, though, the wine displays sharp acidity, an angular profile, and tart plum flavors. Finishes lean, and could use more flesh, less bite.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Merlot
"With rich, honeyed flavors of apricots and oranges, this flashy, dramatic Chardonnay seemingly tastes as sweet as a pastry, but the amazing thing is that it's actually dry. It's brisk in coastal acidity, with complex nuances of toasty oak and a creamy mouthfeel. For drinking now.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Generic red fruit and milk chocolate aromas precede a tangy palate with a fairly high acid-to-body ratio. This tastes of tart red plum, with a hint of chocolate; it's short, crisp and quaffable. Novo Imports and Aidil Wines & Liquors.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Packaged in a cheerful bright blue bottle, this offers simple aromas of wild flower, cut grass and citrus. It's a simple, fresh white, with a bright finish of melon and peach.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio

"The winery's best Hilltops in years, dry and elegantly structured. There's real power to the baked black cherry and currant fruit, with all sorts of meaty, earthy, peppery nuances that linger long into the finish. The alcohol is robust, but in keeping with the wine's volume, giving it a rich, warming headiness. Drink now–2018, as suits your taste.",US-California-Syrah

"This dark, heavy Pinot Noir is surprisingly soft for a Sonoma Coast bottling, despite its rich layers of black cherry pie, licorice, cola and smoky sandalwood. Drink it now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Black currant stars in this mountain wine, juicy and brushy in big, pillowy tannin. Still tightly wound, it shows complexity and plenty of natural structure, begging for more time in the bottle to allow for the gunpowder, smoky oak and dark, lush black fruit to marry further. It should show best 2020 through 2023.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Another great success from Merryvale. Somehow they manage to make red wines that are ripe, oaky and opulent, yet maintain balance so that you can drink it over the course of a meal without the flavors palling. Dry and tannicly sophisticated, it shows complex waves of blackberries, cassis, cherries and sweet, smoky cedar.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Peach-pit and stone-fruit aromas are dry and a touch bitter. Because this is so young, it's juicy and minerally in its current state, with citric acidity in the driver's seat. Nectarine and tangerine flavors finish fresh but simple.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Torrontés

"Kian Tavakoli is the winemaker for this small-production Cabernet Sauvignon with some Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. A brambly, full-bodied wine, it's concentrated in black fruit with a spicy streak of clove.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Pinot comes from a small block in the estate vineyard, on the Napa side of Carneros. Right out of the bottle, it's very dry and acidic, marked by fresh, jammy raspberry and cherry flavors. All indications point to the cellar, except for a funkiness that may become more pronounced with age. It's risky, but try holding through 2016.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"From the winery that first popularized Petite Sirah in California, this vintage has vivid black-pepper aromas and a deep, inky color. Rich and concentrated flavors suggest pomegranate juice, blackberries and clove. Lavish and layered tannins give the texture an almost thick viscosity that coats the mouth for a lasting impression.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"A fruity red, with jammy plum flavors and a smooth texture. The wine shows some of the elegance for which Taylor Fladgate is famed, while also offering a rich aftertaste.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Creamy and lush, with pure peach and pear aromas along with nice vanilla accents. The palate is fairly rich and layered, but it's also properly acidic and, therefore, well balanced. The flavors of pear and butter seem on the money, and the finish is solid and of moderate length. All in all, this is a very good Chardonnay with no overt faults.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Chardonnay
"This wine is smooth while keeping all of its fresh wits about it. Citrus, red apple and quince flavors give both spice and ripe fruits. With its lively, tangy aftertaste, it does need to broaden out, so drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Caramel and baked-apple aromas are nutty and not pushy. This is crisp, with hard-hitting acidity. Flavors of orange peel, toffee and oxidized white fruits finish nutty, much like walnut oil. This is a fine Sherry but it's a bit tangy and high in acid.",Spain-Andalucia-Sherry
"An attractive price for a straightforward, Amador County Zin, full-bodied and tasting of ripe blackberries and cocoa.",US-California-Zinfandel
"The winery pulled out all the stops on this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, yet the wine is so tannic and sharp now. Shows massively extracted black currant and oak flavors that run deep and long in the finish. Who knows what this wine might do in 10–15 years, but it's a roll of the dice.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
The aromas of melon and tropical fruit are light but enchanting. The medium-bodied flavors provide interest and show a pleasing sense of balance.,US-Washington-Pinot Gris
"Aromas of red berry, underbrush, chopped herb and a toasted note lead the nose. On the rather lean palate, notes of espresso, toasted hazelnut and sage accent a sour cherry core.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A nice everyday sparkler. It's a little sweet and very forward in lime and strawberry flavors, with the yeast and toast complications of a fine sparkling wine.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Heavy and full-bodied, a dense, soft Pinot Noir that seems too ripe for comfort. The cherry and currant flavors veer into raisins. The vineyard is from the warmest part of Russian River Valley, almost into Dry Creek Valley.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Ripe and floral in pencil lead, this estate-grown wine is subdued in fruit, preferring instead to conjure savory and herbal notes from the glass. Tobacco, leather and wild anise support that context and statement, the texture roundly lush.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Here's a nice, rich Pinot Noir for drinking now. It's fairly soft and sweet, showing raspberry and cherry cream, vanilla, toasty oak and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened with acidity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A flintiness mixes with lemon peel in this full-bodied, oak-driven white with aspects of freshness that balance the more concentrated flavor and texture.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Juicy, this has an exotic twist of burnt cherry and orange to it, accented in Asian spice. Soft, with moderate acidity, it retains an earthy underlay of roses that add to the full-bodied length and density.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This warm, forward wine has sensations of nail polish remover, underbrush, resin, mature black plum and overripe black cherry. The evolved palate is framed by astringent tannins that dry out the mouth.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"VJB's estate Syrah, from Sonoma Valley, is vintage variable, and 2004 was kind to it. The grapes got quite ripe, so the wine, which is slightly hot, shows lush flavors of black and red currants, dates and figs, chocolate macaroons, anisette and peppery spices. Yet it maintains a balancing backbone of acids.",US-California-Syrah
"This is a silky and soft Nebbiolo with bright berry aromas and simple spice nuances. There's an elegant, feminine quality to this red wine, but it also shows power and determination.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This fragrant blend of Nero d'Avola and Frappato boasts alluring blue flower, black-skinned berry and leather aromas.

Enjoy through 2021.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend

"Here's an everyday Merlot for easy drinking with beef, pork and chicken dishes. It's soft, dry and tannic, with modest cherry and herb flavors.",US-California-Merlot
"This presents aromas of ripe black fruit—just shy of overripe—and bitter almond. The palate shows black cherry, baked plum and cinnamon flavors. While it's simply structured and a little shy on fresh acidity, it's still very enjoyable thanks to the generous fruit.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
Very varietal aromas of sour cherry and cranberry lead to a fruit-filled flavorful palate. Light oak accents linger on the finish. It's a very pleasing example of the variety.,US-Washington-Sangiovese

"Aromas of currant, plum, herbs and dry brush are fresh, focused and don't try too hard. Wiry and juicy on the palate but not all that deep, this blend of 40% Cabernet and 60% Mencía tastes of pointed plum and raspberry, flavors that turn a touch sour on a zesty, acidic finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is too ripe and obvious for its own good. It's very good, offering a vast wealth of pie filling blackberries, cherries, cassis, licorice and chocolate flavors, but you find yourself wishing that, at this price, it had greater structure and was a little more aloof and tantalizing.",US-California-Red Blend
"This grassy North Coast offering has plenty of lime, kiwi and jalapeño flavors that are able to stand up to spicy appetizers with its crisp, long finish. Proceeds are donated to the restoration of watersheds for steelhead trout and coho salmon.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"A tight, steely and fresh wine, this is dominated by grapefruit, citrus and nervy acidity. A strongly herbaceous character gives a fruity, crisp aftertaste. The blend is Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillion and Muscadelle.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Leather, mint and wet-dog aromas along with an overriding burn drive the nose toward a resiny, raw palate with snappy acidity and lots of oak. Buttery as well as briny red-fruit flavors are salty and taste mostly of wood resin.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro
"This is an earthy, rustic wine tasting of black cherry, cola and a mention of sage, medium bodied on the palate and softly textured. It will please a range of palates, showing varietal character with vigor.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 15% Malbec, 12% Cabernet Franc and 9% Petit Verdot seems slightly muddled, with notes of dried herbs, flowers, barrel spices and plum. Flavors are soft and chocolaty, with an elegant styling and grainy tannins.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Soft and simple, with sweet, easy cherry and strawberry jam flavors and a silky texture.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a beautiful Cabernet Sauvignon. It epitomizes the Napa quality of power married to finesse.

It's dry and balanced, with rich, complex blackberry, sage and sweet oak flavors. Drink now–2017.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This lacy, fine-tuned Grenache displays superb aromatics that are still a bit raw. One gets the feeling that as good as the juicy, young grape and berry flavors are, this wine has more complexity lurking below the surface. Berry, mineral and bright spices elevate the finish, much like a youthful Montsant.",US-Washington-Grenache
"Light in color from the wood aging, this is also a light wine. Fruit is secondary to the acidity and strong wood-aging flavors. It leaves a dry aftertaste.",Portugal-Port-Port
"This is a 50-50 blend of estate-grown Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in neutral oak. Dark, plush, well-ripened fruit is the focus of a wine still a bit stiff and steely. It's classic in the way a Bordeaux is classic, firm and confidently blended.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Situated at the mouth of the Pinhão River in the heart of the Douro vineyards, the steep slopes of this quinta are a prominent landmark. The wine is dark and dense, made to age with its firm tannins and concentrated black fruit flavors. Structured and still very firm, it will age well. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Light, oaky spices and rich berry flavors mix it up in this tangy, somewhat tannic wine. It's full bodied but the firm acidity and fine-grained tannins keep it lively.",US-California-Barbera
"Sprightly, fresh Mirabelle plum mixes with headier notes of rose to present a full-fruited but fresh array of juicy, sweet pear, more plum, mandarin and tangerine. The mouthfeel has that typical Gewurztraminer oily richness but also a welcome slick of 2014 acidity.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"A fluorescent pink color introduces this soft, full and fruity wine with fine, balanced acidity. There is a touch of caramel, along with crisp acidity from red-cherry flavors. Ready to drink. Screwcap.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Rosé
"Snappy and a little green on the nose, with hints of juniper and green apple. The palate is perfectly good but nothing special, while the flavors of apple and citrus are punchy and pure. Frothy but controlled, with lots of flavor and forward kick. Apéritif city!",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend

"There are solid Cabernet flavors of blackberries and black currants in this dry, tannic wine. It's rough and astringent in the mouth, without much charm, but a rich steak, maybe topped with a gorgonzola sauce, will make it shine.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This smells a bit smoky, tastes ripe and almost sweet and feels smooth, juicy and not too full bodied. It has a tempting cherry syrup flavor, light tannins and welcome acidity to buoy up all the fruit flavors.",US-California-Merlot

"Briny green olive notes underlie a tropically ripe, full-bodied expression of the variety. The wine's apple, pineapple and mango fruit is wrapped in toasted oak and moderate acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A more modest varietal wine than some of the producer's block-specific bottlings, it nonetheless stuns in its combination of blackberry crumble, dark chocolate and sanguine meatiness. The texture is luxuriously smooth and lasting.",US-California-Zinfandel
"You'll barely notice a touch of oak on this dry wine. It shows the zesty acidity and varietal purity of all Edna Valley whites, with citrus, lychee, tart green apple and white pepper flavors that stimulate the palate and prepare it for food. A very nice job in a restaurant-style Sauvignon Blanc.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Given that this is where Santa Barbara County's first Syrah was planted, it's no wonder that Zaca Mesa makes well-balanced expressions of the grape with stunning consistency. This bottling shows blackberry, black pepper, cola and purple flowers on the nose, leading into a tightly structured palate packed with tart black-plum skins, beef char and more black-pepper dust.",US-California-Syrah

It's straightforward but savory and made to be enjoyed young.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"Ripe, soft wine that has good dense fruit flavors as well as richness. There is some new wood, but the wine remains elusive, perhaps still young. On the palate, the wood spice is still dominant, with only the acidity hinting at the fruit.",Portugal-Dão-Portuguese White

"This Cab shows the firm tannins and concentrated fruit of Atlas Peak, combined with the modern style of soft approachability. It's rich in blackberry and cherry pie flavors, with a generous overlay of sweet oak. Seems too sweet and one-dimensional for aging, so drink it now and through 2015 for freshness.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Pure, concentrated blackberry and cassis aromas are right on target, as is most of this impressive Malbec that hails from 88-year-old vines. An exuberant palate shows young, bouncy, rubbery tannins, while this tastes complex, with blackberry and plum flavors playing off savory, saucy notes. An everlasting finish says drink all the way through 2027.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This is a keeper. Smoky, charred aromas, rich dark-fruit flavors like blackberry and boysenberry and meaty, peppery accents fill up this full-bodied and very firmly textured wine. It will get even more interesting with age; try it after 2020.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Smells raw and minty, like mint jelly that's been mixed in with some raspberry jelly, and tastes sweet and artificially oaked. Overpriced for the quality.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"This earthy expression of Sangiovese and 10% Colorino opens with funky aromas of scorched soil, truffle and game. The palate offers dried black cherry, toast, clove and a truffle note. Round but somewhat fleeting tannins provide the easy-drinking framework. Drink through 2015.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"The opening is oaky, thus cedar and balsamic aromas run roughshod over the cherry, roast plum and vanilla scents. The palate is wiry and acidic, with flavors of herbal plum and cherry that lead to a driving, acid-rich finish, with an earthy, baked flavor and a herbal overtone.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Carmenère

"The vineyard is in a cooler part of the valley, and shows its terroir in the acid-driven sour-cherry candy and persimmon flavors. The texture is delicately silky, and the finish is complex in spices, with that acidity lingering long. Cellar it until 2018, at the very least.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Named after the Estrela mountain range that lies on the east of the Dão, this structured, mineral-driven wine is firm yet packed with juicy red berries and currants that give a fragrant, juicy character. It needs more time, so drink from 2017.",Portugal-Dão-Portuguese Red
"Based in the Côte des Blancs Grand Cru village of Oger, this producer draws on some very fine vines. That superior fruit gives this vintage wine its texture, minerality and intensity. Crisp with acidity and a flinty texture, it still needs further time to develop. Drink from 2019.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay

The wine is ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"Shows a delicate texture, almost Pinot Noir-like in lightness, yet offers a blast of berry, spice, tobacco, cola and bacon flavors that are lusty and ripe. The grapes come from the Green Valley, and the alcohol is low while acidity is high. Beautiful and classy, a Zin to drink with everything from salmon and steak to tuna and short ribs.",US-California-Zinfandel
"An inaugural release, this is made from specific blocks grown in Knights Valley and Alexander Valley as well as from the high-elevation Cooley Ranch. Leathery and tannic, it coils in youthful aggression, just barely allowing for a taste of blackberry jam and chocolate.",US-California-Malbec
"Fresh, fruity and fragrant, this wine has a pure line of acidity and crisp citrus alongside its tangy texture. The tightness shows its aging potential; drink from 2020. Founded in the 13th century by Benedictine monks, Château Carbonnieux is one of the oldest estates in the Bordeaux region. In 1956, Marc Perrin purchased the château and began vineyard and winery renovations that were continued by son Antony. The property is now run by grandsons Eric and Philibert.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend

"Rooty aromas of cola nut, baked berry fruits and blackberry jam set up a plush, jammy palate of solid tannic framework.

The flavors are deeply delicious, suggesting raspberries and cola, pomegranates and rhubarbs, cranberries and white pepper spice. The price is fair considering the pedigree. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"With huckleberry and other blue fruit aromas and flavors, this wine doesn't seem varietally correct, but it's hard to ignore its lightly sweet, soft-feeling appeal and chalky tannins. It's not profound but still makes you reach for another sip to ponder it.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A great Bordeaux-style wine that can stand proudly next to Napa bottlings that cost far more. It's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four permitted Meritage varieties, and there seems to be lots of new, sweetly toasted oak. The blackberry, cherry, red currant, mocha and bacon flavors are delicious, but even better is the tannic structure. It's soft and alluring enough to drink now.",US-California-Meritage

It's elegant and silky without having to flex its muscles.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz

"Here's a young, dry, acidic Pinot Noir that clearly wants some time in the cellar. It has a beautifully silky texture, and is made in a light, elegant style, with very complex flavors.

Better after 2011 and should develop for 3–5 years after that.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Freshly cut green apple with a touch of lemon signals great refreshment on the nose. The palate has a touch more roundness, giving more flesh to the apple fruit. It still plays a brisk, dry Riesling game, characterized by lemon on a dry, slender palate.",Austria-Kamptal-Riesling
"Mostly Cabernet, with a small percentage of the other Bordeaux varieties, this is a very rich, dramatically layered wine. It's notable for both its intensely smooth tannins and the lush fruit, which suggests waves of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, rose petals and oak, courtesy of 100% new French barrels. Yet there's an underlying minerality that gives firmness and grounding. Feels ultrarich on the palate now, and should ride out the next decade with ease.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This is a light and breezy blend of Sangiovese and Merlot that doesn't have huge intensity but that does have a nice focus on fruit. It's a no-fuss, easy wine with bursting cherry, almond blossom and ripe strawberry in the background.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This is an easy-drinking, roundly accessible vineyard designate, with a depth and breadth of black fruit, cedar, currant and cocoa powder. A juicy midpalate gives way to an integrated finish, unburdened by tannin and oak, despite the mountain provenance and full-bodied power of the wine.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This straightforward, simple wine brings together sensations of violet, red cherry and light baking spices. The warm, forward palate finishes on a sweet note of cherry extract. It's made to be enjoyed young and will pair well with hearty pasta dishes.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Tannic and dry, it's one tough wine, stinging the gums. But it has plenty of ripe blackberry, coffee, pepper and toasty flavors, and should age well. Hold onto it until 2019.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"The wine from Denis Coudroy's 10 acres of vines is perfumed from new wood, with a polished character and bright fruit flavors. Underneath the wood, there is plenty of black-currant juiciness and fresh acidity. Drink this attractive wine from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Fragrant and floral, this white blend of Trebbiano, Pecorino and Passerina from the Marche offers stone fruit, green melon and honeysuckle. The wine has a clean and refreshing quality that promises an easy pairing with spicy Asian foods.",Italy-Central Italy-White Blend
"This is a tight, mineral-textured wine with fresh citrus and lemon-zest flavors and a steely character. It is crisp, almost cool in style and could do with some aging in bottle.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"Blended with small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this has pinpoint focus and is packed with ripe berry fruit. The oak aging (45% new) and crisp tannins layer in veins of espresso and dark chocolate. Drink now through 2022.",US-Washington-Malbec
"Earth, mud and wet clay are laid against a ripe black raspberry frame on this bottling from winemaker Larry Brooks. Plenty of life, zest and lift enliven the beautifully spiced palate, with bright red cherries, cranberries and purple flowers cut by a line of pencil-lead minerality and a savory fennel element.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Almost entirely Cabernet Sauvignon (98%), this structured and dense wine is packed with concentrated dark fruits that are firm, showing intense acidity and freshness under the dark tannins. It's classic Bordeaux, with fruit and tannins in equal measure and needing time. Drink from 2024.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Low-yielding vines cropped down to 1.5 tons/acre contribute to the length and power of this tart, lip-smacking Pinot Gris. There's a delicious mineral underpinning to the subtle flavor mix of Asian pear, apple and lemon. A nice hint of tarragon also comes into focus.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"This is hardly a fashionable color for rosé, deep and almost like a light red wine. It tastes heavy, although the red fruits are cut by ample acidity. The finish is rich and ripe.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Rosé
"Light and murky, with a flavor mix of tomato, vegetable juice, celery, barely ripe berries and thin acids. That sounds worse than it is; taste this alongside a Bourgogne from a big shipper in a cool vintage and you wouldn't see much difference. The alcohol here is listed at just 12.5%. It's a serviceable everyday wine, but not priced accordingly.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Faint whiffs of sugar cookie sweeten this straightforward, fruity wine that's full of juicy tangerine and apple flavors. Spine-tingling acidity lends freshness to the midpalate, leaving a clean finish. Drink now.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Soft and warm, this wine originates from the northern end of the Côte de Nuits. It has wild-raspberry and dark cherry flavors balanced with elegant acidity. It's wine that will age quickly, so drink from 2014.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Lodi-based Michael David turns to Lodi, Sonoma's Dry Creek Valley and Lake County to craft this white wine, mostly Sauvignon Blanc with a drop of Sémillon too. Ready for a summer's day with subtle Mandarin orange, mango and lime notes, it finishes quick and crisp.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Soft and awkward, with dull berry flavors that have a vegetal tinge.",US-California-Syrah
"Powerful and dense, this wine exudes the darkest of tannins as well as intense black fruit. Layers of richness and structure show in this Port's considerable ageability, while its acidity lends freshness. This is a wine that should be aged for 15 years or more.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Tastes soft and high in alcohol, with flavors of chocolate, cherry pie filling and spice. An appealing wine that's for drinking now.",US-California-Red Blend
"The second vintage of this Rainstorm rosé sports fruit flavors of watermelon and strawberry, with hints of fresh cracker in both the aroma and the finish. But it's the fresh fruit that's driving the flavor bus here, with some added length and detail as it winds down, perhaps due in part to the native yeast fermentation.",US-Oregon-Rosé
"Tart lemon verbena is highlighted in taste and aroma in this structured, elegant and zesty wine. Textured and medium bodied, it finishes with some graceful weight.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Equal parts power and grace, this wine appeals widely with its forward, concentrated apple and lemon flavors. Oak tones of caramel, spice and smoke show prominently on the nose, but integrate neatly on the palate. It's lusciously mouthfilling, finishing with a kiss of butterscotch and spice.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"A well-made Tempranillo that's lush and rich yet balanced, its tannins well structured and its blueberry fruit intensity inviting. Lay it down awhile or give it a chance to breathe.",US-California-Tempranillo
"Earthy flavors emerge first and have an aromatic hold over the entire wine. The bubbles seem to carry even more earthy tones, but the freshness in the center is lemony and bright. This balance of light and dark tones offers a moody aspect to the wine—perhaps it would be better as a winter apéritif than a summer freshener.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"Blackberry and blueberry juice aromas are lifted by vanilla and anise on the nose of this bottling from a Westside Paso producer. The tannins are strong and thick, and then smooth out into blackberry, mocha and vanilla flavors into the finish.",US-California-Syrah
"Packaged in a screw cap bottle (still a rare sight in Italy) this fresh white is packed with almond blossom, lemon zest and dried herb aromas. Try it with lemon chicken.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Grillo
"A little too soft, which gives a flat, lifeless quality to the mouthfeel. On the other hand, the flavors are wonderful, ranging from cherries and currants to an exquisite overlay of oak. Doesn't seem to be going anywhere, so drink up.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"With a great balance between fruit and acidity, this is just what a 10-Year-Old tawny should be. Ripe fruits are cut by acidity and given a shot of wood aging. Spice and old gold flavors lead to a delicious fresh aftertaste.",Portugal-Port-Port
"This 100% Sangiovese wine opens with fragrant blue flower and underbrush scents. Juicy red cherry fills out the palate, with clove and a ground pepper note. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Quite light in color, this energetic blend of 76% Grenache and 24% Mourvèdre offers cinnamon stick, star anise, cola, raspberry and strawberry on the juicy and bright nose. The palate shows a lighter but juicy cranberry-fruit profile, with fennel, coriander and white pepper. It's a great, lighter style of red wine.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"The winery's flagship Cabernet, this offers elements of cranberry and black cherry that slide onto the palate rather than explode. Fig and plum give it a savory edge, around accents of pencil lead, mocha and clove. Rich and soft on the tongue, the wine offers plenty to enjoy now, but it will also yield intrigue over several years, through 2029.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"With a dark enough color to be a red wine and ample cherry and plum flavors, this Grenache bottling is not simply an apéritif. It's full-bodied, rather rich in texture and will pair nicely with meats and cheeses.",US-California-Rosé
"This Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon and Muscadelle blend is rounded and ripe, with yellow fruit flavors to go with the fresher acidity. It shows the ripe, tropical side of the Sauvignon Blanc—rich and full in the mouth. Drink from early 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend

"It's amazing how wineries across the country can take Central Coast fruit and make it sing, but this producer certainly does. Lavish vanilla, cola and ripe black cherries invite the nose with glee. Then the palate blends black cherry and black plum with caramel and mocha notes in this crowd-pleaser.",US-California-Syrah
"Dominated at this young stage by wood, this is a potentially rich and creamy wine. Its structure shines through, full and generous. The fruits and the acidity still have to develop, but already the wine is showing the rounded character of a great Pouilly Fuissé. It's a wine to age, so drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

Both fruit ripeness and meaty depth are here in abundance, with a complex mix of tree fruits and stone fruits, streaks of earth and a fine layering of chocolate. This is a wine you excavate as much as drink; it's full of surprises.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"Very fruity and fresh, this wine has crisp apples as well as red fruit giving it a bright, delicious feeling. The acidity goes right through the wine, giving a beautifully fresh feel that points up the fragrant raspberries. Vineyards are in the heart of the sandy soils of the Saint Tropez peninsula.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This blend of grapes from Bien Nacido, Presqu'ile and Riverbench vineyards is light in color with aromas of turned earth, dust and sliced strawberries. It's elegant and lean on the palate, with lots of slate and graphite minerality warming up toward macerated strawberry sauce. Pair with everything from white fish to pork tenderloin.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Lots of rich, ripe varietal flavor in this dry, tannic young Cabernet. It's strong in blackberries and cassis, with a cedary edge that has the scent of a cigar box. Firm enough to develop some bottle complexity over the next 6 years or so.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Smooth, sweet and savory, this Cabernet has forward flavors of blackberries, black currants, cola and sweet oak. It's an easy wine to drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Dietro le Case (“behind the houses”) is a pure expression of Inzolia that opens with a pale hay color and fragrant aromas of melon, apricot and dried flowers. It's a simple, fresh wine with accents of citrus and honey.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Inzolia
"This cuvée is made with the oldest Pommard clones in the estate vineyard. It's a sharp-edged, reserve-level wine with a defining streak of peppery herb. The black fruits and barrel flavors of licorice, espresso and dark chocolate promise further depth as it ages. Drink 2020–2030.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"I really liked the past releases of this wine, but the '04 is not in the same league. It's a hot wine, with baked or stewed fruit flavors, and finishes with prickly, drily astringent tannins. Not going anywhere, so drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe plum and plenty of vanilla and cherry provide the perception of sweetness in this wine. That sensation may stem from the pushing-the-envelope generosity of the ripe fruit or from the oak. or both. It makes for a full-bodied, heady experience.",US-California-Zinfandel
"With 75,000 cases of this wine now coming to the U.S., it has to be one of the more ubiquitous New Zealand offerings. Thankfully, the quality is very good, with ripe nectarine aromas and flavors touched by just a slight varietally correct grassiness. Long and mouthwatering on the finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Slightly herbal, but not so much so that the bouquet is off or unappealing. Racy and a little rubbery on the palate, with generic but solid berry and herbal aromas. Long, herbal and only mildly scratchy on the finish. Standard Merlot from Chile.",Chile-Curicó Valley-Merlot
"Lightly scented, this linear white opens with aromas of orchard fruit and wildflower. The lithe, elegant palate delivers crisp green apple, pear and flinty mineral while racy acidity provides plenty of verve and freshness.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Bianco

"Toasty, roasted aromas of baked berry and earth head straight to a narrowly built yet weighty palate with earth, plum and raspberry notes. On the finish, this holds onto its plum and raspberry flavors as well as its fresh feel.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo-Garnacha
"A blend of 80% Sangiovese, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot, this wine begins with aromas of oak, vanilla, toast and espresso. The palate offers up ripe black cherry, black currant and coffee sweetened with vanilla. It finishes on a note of drying wood tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Toasty right away, with lightly baked apple aromas. The palate has a fine feel and good overall intensity, while the flavors of lemon, white grapefruit and apple are subtle and clean. Long and persistent, and showing quite a bit for a standard nonvintage Cava.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend

"Opening aromas of crushed black cherry, blue flower, sweet baking spices and mocha carry over to the palate along with a hint of vanilla. It's friendly, round and ready; enjoy now to capture the juicy fruit flavors.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Fairly woody at first, with cassis, berry and lemon rind on the nose. The palate is chunky and round, with flavors of black currant, blackberry and spice. Toward the end hickory and sap come up, which brings you back to that woodiness of the bouquet. Imported by Atlanta Improvement Co.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Smoky and rubbery upon opening, with woodspice settling in as the dominant aroma. Tight and jagged in the mouth, with minty, toasty flavors of black fruits and pepper. Turns more tannic, drying and woody with time.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Bonarda
"Unusually for a Champagne from the Montagne de Reims, better known for its Pinot Noir, this is a 100% Chardonnay. It is ripe and fruity—a warm wine with apricot and spice as well as crisper citrus. Drink this smooth wine now.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"The Fillippini family has been growing grapes in eastern Paso Robles since 1982, and this is among their better modern bottlings.

"This pretty wine is rich, dry and softly tannic. Although it's a little high in alcohol, it feels smooth and round, showing Cab's riper side of blackberry jam, cassis liqueur and chocolate, generously oaked. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, it's great to drink now and over the next four years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Earthy notes of pear mix with the generous sweetness of a late harvest wine. The palate is concentrated and lushly sweet, but full of rich flavors, tinged with pear and orange, caramel and lemon oil, acacia honey and candied lemon peel. Lovely, bright and still totally fresh. Drink 2016–2030.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
Dark color and a severe tartness make this wine challenging on the palate. It's overripe in terms of tropical fruit and bogged down by a sourness that's hard to shake. Let it open and pair it with creamy foods like goat cheese to get it to behave.,US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a soft, rounded rosé, with red fruits right to the fore. With its attractive acidity, it is dry and very food friendly. Ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"This opens with aromas of pressed acacia flowers, ripe stone fruits and dried sage. The palate isn't overly sweet, offering dried apricot, wildflower honey and toasted almond notes.",Italy-Tuscany-Vermentino
"Burgáns is usually one of the better value-priced Albariños on the market, and this 2014 keeps that momentum going. White-flower and stone-fruit aromas are a touch dusty, while the palate feels peachy. Stone-fruit flavors are familiar, while the finish is zesty and clean.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño

The long, flavorful finish features citrus pith, lime and minerals. If you want a combination of complexity and forwardness, this is your wine.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc

"Golden honey in color, the Ramspeck Sassolini is lush with lemon flavor and high acidity that lingers on the palate, crisp and tart. Sourced from Lake County fruit, a fine place for crisp whites, this wine is balanced in alcohol and richness too.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"Quite dark in the glass, this is a lush rather than lithe expression of the shapeshifting grape, with bright boysenberry, black plum, uncrushed peppercorn, soy, roast beef and espresso aromas. Black pepper shows on the palate, but blueberry and blackberry fruits dominate, boosted by a touch of dark chocolate and presented with solid acidic sizzle.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"A confectionary note of marshmallow gives way to lighter intimations of citrus and sour-apple skin, making for a confusing combination of ripeness and tartness.",US-California-Chardonnay
"There is not a lot by way of scent, the palate, however, delivers the freshness of sliced lemon and yellow grapefruit. The body is light but wonderfully clean and refreshing.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"This 100% Pinot Noir is full-bodied and rich, with raspberry, cherry, yeast, toast and vanilla flavors that finish sweet and honeyed. The mouthfeel is soft and silky. Lovely for drinking now, as a toast or just Sunday brunch.",US-California-Sparkling Blend

"Produced mainly from Merlot with only 10% of Cabernet Sauvignon, this fat, juicy wine has red-berry flavors that are supported by dry tannins that are in the process of softening. Notes from the wood-aging also need to integrate. Drink from late 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This structured wine has a great weight of fruit behind its firm tannins. Juicy acidity gives a delicious, fragrant and ripe character. Drink this wine from 2016.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Smoky leather and burly tannins combine for a generously powerful wine, soft in black and red fruit and chocolate. It has a full-bodied ripeness that veers on becoming caricature but never does, dialing things back to find beauty and balance on the finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Warm, rich wine with tropical flavors of mango, peach and with a ripe feel. It has weight, although the fruit does hint at crispness. There is a toast and nuts character that broadens out the interest.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese White

"Extremely lifting and fluffy aromas of grape soda, very ripe olallieberries and nearly a bubblegum element arise on the nose of this accessible wine, which will appeal to lovers of many varietals. It's similarly poppy and easy to sip on the palate, with a strong acidic zing.",US-California-Syrah
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, this is a bold, concentrated and flavorful wine that will mature well over the next 10 years. Aromas of espresso, crème de cassis, spiced blackberry, boysenberry preserves, tobacco and woodspice abound and carry through to the robust, gripping palate. It's firmly structured, but harmonious in it's overall strength, with final notes of campfire, char and cocoa on the long finish.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Medium bodied and fresh-tasting, this well-balanced wine emphasizes its apple and lemon flavors without much oak intervention. It has refreshing acidity and a clean finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Crisp, elegant black-plum and cassis flavors are framed with notes of fresh herb, dried lavender, cedar and tobacco on this single-vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon. Generous proportions of new French-oak add abundant vanilla and sweet-spice tones to the nose and palate. Pleasurable now, but grippy tannins and a firm structure could evolve well over the next 3–5 years.",US-New York-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Even though the wine is dry, there are hints of the honey that's typical of the sweeter Jurançon. The honey contrasts with the bone-dry core and white fruit flavors that revel in both acidity and youthful structure.

"Coda della Foce (a blend of Nero d'Avola, Merlot and Petit Verdot that sees 17 months in oak) delivers a sweet nose of cherry fruit, red rose, blueberry and Indian spice. The wine has firm density and raw tannins followed by succulent fruit flavors.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"Tasted shortly after bottling, this needed some airing to blow off the sulfur. Once open it showed itself to be a palate-pleasing, round and spicy wine, elaborating its pear fruit with notes of orange peel and Meyer lemon.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"This reserve wine was made from grapes grown in the same Bien Nacido and Sierra Madre vineyards as Rusack's regular 2012 Chardonnay, but it was produced in much smaller quantities, and it's a distinctly richer wine. Aged in ample new French oak, it has a toasty, caramelized opulence that the underlying tropical fruit, apricot, pear and citrus flavors are easily able to handle.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Quite creamy and sweet on the nose, with marshmallow and candy aromas that are not that convincing. Solid in the mouth, with herbal fruit, chocolate and plump tannins, body and extract. Better in terms of mouthfeel and concentration than flavor. Malbec, with Cabernet, Syrah and Petit Verdot.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"This is a gorgeous Brunello that proudly defies the difficulties associated with this hot vintage. The wine exhibits freshness and buoyancy in the form of crisp cherry and blueberry. It also offers deep layers of cola, coffee and mineral and although the mouthfeel is chewy, there's enough silky softness to even it out.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Fleshy and ripe, with blackberry and currant flavors just beginning to turn the curve from primary fruit and cocoa to bottle bouquet. Picking up notes of dried fruits and dried flowers. Yet the tannins are still firm and acidity still cuts across the middle. A little unbalanced but interesting. Now–2012.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is classic Beringer Private Reserve Chard, ripe, oaky, lush, balanced and utterly delicious. There's a lot of everything, from massive tropical and citrus fruits to creamy lees. The malolactic fermentation helps make it buttery and 80% new French oak brings buttered toast and vanilla-bean richness. Balance comes by way of acidity and minerality.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot make up three-quarters of this blend, with the balance Petit Verdot and Syrah. The aromas of herb, barrel spice, fig, dried fruit and vanilla are reserved while the red- and black-fruit flavors are rich but deft, with the tannins providing some heft. It seems a bit more evolved than its age might suggest.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This shows clean and polished aromas of crème de cassis, wild berry, cola, ginger and dried mint. The mouthfeel is linear and bright but also firm.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
This densely hued wine has aromas of black plum and vanilla that carry over to the simple palate along with a touch of cedar. Pliant tannins give it an easygoing nature. Drink soon.,Italy-Central Italy-Sangiovese

It's full bodied, has a smooth texture, mild tannins and a lingering finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Apple and pear flavors dominate this attractive wine. It has a simple, fruit-forward character, and it's soft, rounded and developing well. On the finish, a more tangy, fresh character shows.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Foxy blueberry and jumpy aromas hint at volatility and are a bit alarming. But give this normally excellent wine some time and it comes around. In the mouth, this is textured, tannic and a bit lactic. For flavors, look for lightly herbal blueberry and cassis. The 2010 vintage was cold by Chilean standards, and that is evident in this wine.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Red Blend
"There's an exotic, almost Indian personality, with aromas of dark spice, clove and cardamom. Black fruit, prune and currant are also in evidence. Bold, black and inky thick. It's soft, round and long on the close with pretty freshness, too.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"This is a fine example of what Barossa Shiraz is capable of at a realistic price. It's full bodied and richly textured, plush without being too soft. French oak brings a smoky, bacony element to the ripe blueberry fruit, plus a dusting of baking spices that lingers on the finish. Drink now–2025.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
This is the entry-level red from this family-owned estate. It is soft and juicy with some attractive red-berry fruits. The tannins are really gentle just giving a structure to the warm fruits and acidity. Drink now.,Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Fluffy, sweet aromas of peach, pear and vanilla are as good as it gets. Tastes of powdered sugar and the most forced oak you can imagine. Not at all surprising that it's resiny on the finish.",Chile-Maule Valley-Chardonnay
"This wine is dry and rather full bodied, starting with fruity aromas like banana and coconut then seguing to more nutty, oaky, complex flavors and a rich texture. It's a serious dinner wine with heft and substance.",US-California-White Blend
"This inexpensive Aussie Shiraz seems to have deteriorated in recent vintages. The 2007 tastes sweet, filled with candied fruit and turning a bit cloying on the finish.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Here's an earthy red that opens with aromas suggesting smoke, tilled soil and leather. The solid, straightforward palate offers mature plum and a hint of almond alongside rather grainy, astringent tannins. Drink through 2017.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Lagrein
"Barolo Vigna Merenda opens with a bright bouquet composed of cherry, spice, floral and balsam elements. This is also an extremely mineral-driven wine that exposes a vein of graphite or crushed stone at its core. Thanks to the wine's natural structure and long persistency, it would make a perfect pairing partner to any dish with black truffles.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This ripe and soft wine has a great balance between the rich red berry fruits, bright cherries and acidity. The structure is full, generous and gives the wine a comfortable feel. Acidity at the end lends a fresher aspect. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir

"Fresh and zesty notes of strawberry, bright raspberry, white pepper and herbal touches of fennel show on the nose of this wine from an iconic vineyard. The herbal influence goes big on the sip, where, thyme, oregano, bay leaf and fennel decorate the light raspberry and cranberry fruit, with vanilla on the finish. It presents a lighter take than usual from this site.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Boysenberry, cracked rainbow peppercorns and dried rose petals show on the nose of this bottling, which plays to the lighter side of the grape. It's tart and brisk once sipped, with cranberry and pomegranate fruit given more complexity by a touch of wild fennel.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"This offers fruit cocktail aromas, with canned pears and light honey, making for an inviting if not varietally typical nose. The flavors are light once sipped, closest to nectarine and apricot. This would be a very drinkable lunchtime wine.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Blades of spearmint and cardamom are prominent on the nose of this wine, followed by a palate rich in pine and black cherry. Lithe with a dense ripeness, the finish is prickly in Asian spice.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Creamy, nutty hints of oak frame fresh pear on nose and palate. The creamy texture cushions the freshness of the wine which has a pleasant weight. Together this makes for an unusual but convincing wine. Lovely now but this has the mileage to last three to five years.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"Fresh and zesty on the nose, this bottling offers lemongrass, lime peel and kiwi scents, with floral jasmine undertones. The palate delivers loads of zing—an almost effervescent energy and verve—with Bosc pear, apple and honeysuckle flavors.",US-California-Viognier
"Bravo to Long Point for making a Cabernet that counts in a cool climate. Rich aromas of anise, mocha and tobacco lead into structured, complex flavors of red berry, cigar and cassis. Spicy but balanced and slightly big, the wine will be great with grilled meat and stew.",US-New York-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A delicious, complex Merlot, although all the parts haven't come together and it needs time in the cellar. It's extraordinarily rich in oak-inspired black cherries, red currants, violets, cocoa, spices and sweet sandalwood, and it should develop nuance and bottle bouquet after 2012.",US-California-Merlot
"The winery's most approachable Cabernet when young, this features notes of chocolate-covered cherry and red and blue berry, intermixed with soft, yet substantial tannins. Peppercorn dances on the palate through the finish. A high-octane intensity suggests that the wine should spend more time in the cellar, through 2021.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is particularly lively and well-balanced, with a relatively light color, bright red-cherry aromas and tangy cranberry flavors that open up to riper plum and maple accents. It's medium-bodied, moderately tannic and especially vivid in acidity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A gentle hint of restrained citrus freshness appears on the nose. The same restrained but wonderfully pure citrus flavor also characterizes the slender, light and dry palate: it's a mix of fresh lemon and aromatic, tangy tangerine peel. This enlivens and refreshes and has a totally uplifting lemony finish.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Pretty to sniff, with aromas of lemon, fresh white fruits and minerals. Feels crisp, chiseled and racy, with blazing acidity propelling green apple, lime, green melon and saline flavors. Long on the finish. Drink now.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Dark and extracted, with jammy berry flavors and a strongly earthy component, including tobacco, sage and tree bark. In the mouth this wine is very dry and pretty tannic, although the acidity is soft. A bit awkward, and not likely to improve in the cellar.",US-California-Merlot
"This pale pink-grey colored wine is a blend of Duras and Merlot. It is lively and fruity, with a red-currant flavor, delicious crisp acidity and a soft, lively aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Southwest France-Rosé
"Light pink with a tint of yellow, this bottling combines grapes from Sonoma County, Monterey County and Santa Barbara County to deliver nectarine, bubblegum and wet slate aromas. There is chalky tension to the palate, with plum flesh and white peach flavors, as well as persistent river rock minerality.",US-California-Rosé
"Bulky aromas are floral but also suggest lanolin. Malic acidity with a resiny offset is the palate feel, while grainy, pushy oak sits on top of pineapple and apple flavors that dry out on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"Pink grapefruit is most pronounced on the otherwise soft, sweet bouquet. The mouth is tangy, with green apple and crisp pear and green melon. In the mouth, there's a welcome creaminess, then a long citrusy finish that offers plenty of sweetness closes things out.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Earthy aromas of forest floor, mushroom and herbs share space with more typical blackberry, cassis and shoe polish scents. This is bold but mildly tartaric and scratchy in feel. Blackberry, coconut and vanilla flavors display the wine's core ripeness and oak content, while the finish is long and flavorful, with density and weight. Drink from winter 2016 through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A soft and fruity style of rosé from a small Aube producer, this is ripe with red berry fruit and bright with acidity and orange zest tang. Dominated by Chardonnay, its color coming from still Pinot Noir wine, it's ready to drink now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Potent aromas of road tar and black pepper meet very concentrated blackberry jam flavors and a sweet but not syrupy mouthfeel in this very dark-colored and full-bodied dessert wine. Made from traditional Portuguese grape varieties, the wine's density and richness of fruit is impressive, and everything tastes in balance.",US-California-Red Blend
"Inviting floral notes open the aromatics of this wine. These evolve into a thick palate of melon and citrus, the finish light and high in acidity. Straightforward and balanced, it's a quaffer.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This spicy, medium-bodied wine is heavily sprinkled with cinnamon and nutmeg aromas. It tucks layers of red cherry and raspberry into the flavors while soothing the palate with a velvety, easy-to-sip texture.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This variety can benefit from new oak while aging, and the spicy layer that envelopes this wine is assertive but very attractive. The aroma is like toasted baguette slices and black-cherry juice, while the flavors are rich, layered and lingering. It's an outstanding wine made in tiny quantities.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Winemaker: Johan Malan. This mature beauty still has plenty of life left in it, as vibrant notes of orange peel, apple skin and wood-grilled peach are met with complementary tones of honeycomb, candied ginger and toasted challah. The palate is full and creamy, but very bright, with mouthwatering acidity that cuts through the rich baked apple, pear butter and toasted sweet spice flavors. Drink now–2020.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Chardonnay
"Light and freshly crisp, this has a good mix of red fruits and tangy acidity. It's so light both in color and flavor, bright at the end and delicious.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Pristine peach and grapefruit flavors contrast with slightly stinky but captivating soil and saffron complexities in this sprightly auslese. Its honey-kissed sweetness pierces through a long, lemony finish. It's delicious already but should continue to improve through 2030, likely beyond.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Savory, meaty notes marry nicely with plummy fruit and clove spice in this wonderfully supple example of Yarra Valley Shiraz. With extended aeration, this wine develops lots of smoky, ashy notes—a possible side effect of nearby bush fires—so I'd opt for drinking it over the next couple of years.",Australia-Victoria-Shiraz
"The wood is piled into this wine, giving a firm, dry, toasty structure. It has weight, the fruit under the wood showing great potential. Give this wine at least three years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a lean Dominus, showing the difficulties of the vintage. It's dry and tannic, with black currant, cherry and cassis flavors that are wrapped in strong, hard tannins. It's a good wine, but lacks the r ich complexity you expect from this property.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Released too young, at just over a year of age, this Pinot tastes sugary, with primary fruit essence, glycerine, alcohol and caramelized oak giving it an uncomfortable sweetness. It's probably technically dry, and should actually taste dry by 2011, but it's certainly not ready to drink before mid-2010.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Gooseberry and lemon peel mix with a wet cement, stony character on the nose of this crisp sipper from the middle of Monterey County. It's light, bright and tart on the palate, with lime peel, grapefruit peel and grassy tones, all laid across a zesty energy and cement minerality.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Vanilla, coconut shavings, earth and dark-fruit aromas are followed by full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors. It delivers enjoyment, but the variety seems to get lost in the oak.",US-Washington-Merlot
"The light herbal and citrus aromas of this medium-bodied wine lead to light grassy, herbal, grapefruity flavors. A good backing of acidity keeps it lively.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Tasted alongside the winery's Family Reserve, there was almost no detectable difference between the two wines. Same aromas; same fruit profile; same piercing acidity in the middle. But this Limited Edition bottling seems to have a tiny bit more roundness, a touch more complexity to the cassis and olive flavors, and a little more balance from front to back.",Chile-Central Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
This is a simple and fresh Italian sparkler that offers white flower and peach backed by citrus and almond. A touch of soft sweetness adds a chewy spot that is followed by creamy mousse.,Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Although this is dense, rubbery and leathery on the nose, with airing the rubbery notes dissolve. It feels snappy and medium in body, with good concentration and flavors of raspberry, toast and herb. Dry, peppery and short on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"Balsam wood, floral berry and herbal aromas rest in front of a crisp, fresh palate with raw acidity and clampy tannins. Olive, pepper, herbal and foresty fruit flavors announce a medium-weight, snappy finish with no obvious oak. This is very nice but at $125 a bottle it has its limits.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley-Red Blend
"A polished, pretty Syrah. It's black in color and very soft, and tastes like a blackberry- and blueberry-infused chocolate drink, with hints of bacon. Luscious and ready to drink now.",US-California-Syrah
Dainty strokes of crisp-tart raspberry and watermelon rind accent this finely textured rosé. It's a brisk delicately concentrated wine with a brambly lingering finish. Drink now.,US-New York-Rosé
"Made from Syrah, Petite Sirah, Dolcetto and Malbec, this wine is bone dry and acidic yet tastes overripe. Although the alcohol is refreshingly low, it has a raisiny flavor and bitter raisin-skin-like tannins.",US-California-Red Blend
"Another of the producer's estate-grown offerings, this vineyard-designate is bittersweet on the palate, rich and yet softly smooth in anise and waxy apple. Plenty of acidity buoys the experience, adding to the wine's ability to stay crisply refreshing on the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Hearty and soulful, this offers aromas of tilled soil, leather, game and woodland berry. The meaty palate is still very tightly wound, delivering black cherry, plum, grilled sage, licorice and tobacco alongside bold tannins. Hold until 2018 then enjoy.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"The nose on this widely available bottling is vivacious and juicy, with strawberry, strawberry blossoms and raspberries laid across a pencil-lead frame. It tightens on the palate, with lots of graphite and pencil shavings, showing just a bit of pomegranate fruit.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A nice Pinot Noir, dry and elegant, and if it's somewhat one-dimensional, it packs a lot of flavor. With rich raspberry, red licorice, bacon and spice flavors, it's a lovely wine to drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This dark, almost black-colored blend combines Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca and Syrah. They all come together in a rich, powerful palate full of explosive black fruit and fine, focused acidity. The structure shows that the wine needs to age further. Drink from 2020.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Soft and melted in the mouth, with jammy flavors of ripe mashed cherries and raspberries, drizzled with milk chocolate and anisette, and finished with a sprinkle of tangerine zest and black pepper.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A bright cherry and banana flavored wine, this is fresh and fruity. It has a light structure that helps to keep it all together along with the acidity for final crispness. Drink now.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"New leather, blue flower, raspberry and Mediterranean herb aromas emerge on this full-bodied, concentrated wine. The structured palate doles out creamy raspberry, juicy black cherry marinated in spirits, cinnamon and pipe tobacco alongside velvety tannins. A licorice note wraps up the warm, lingering finish. It's delicious and already surprisingly accessible.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"For a Beerenauslese this is more rich than sweet. It is very spicy and dry at the core with peppered pear flavors. It's powerful and concentrated, needing aging. Drink from 2017.",Austria-Burgenland-Austrian white blend
"Although this wine earns its reserve designation with extra concentration, it comes at the cost of complexity. The tart rhubarb and cranberry flavors are tight and the mouthfeel blocky; the wine seems to hit a wall and stop at the stiff tannins.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A touch of green is present on the bouquet, while cassis and raspberry aromas fill in the blanks. The palate is creamy and a touch sticky, with raspberry, plum and coconut flavors. A good wine with limitations; it's smooth but unctuous, with a full mouthfeel and good, familiar flavors.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This opens with aromas of wet leaves, forest floor, menthol and prune. Made from Alicante and a drop of Montepulciano, the palate delivers mocha, crushed herb, licorice and a fig note alongside evolved tannins. It's already tired, so drink soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This blend of Zinfandel, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon is soft and slightly sweet, like a dessert. Tastes like a melted mélange of blackberry and cherry jam, milk chocolate granola and dusty spices. Drink now.",US-California-Red Blend
"This bottling comes from the best blocks and barrels from this single vineyard, co-owned by a number of Edna Valley luminaries. The result is stunning, with baked raspberry, strawberry, maple, and peppery bacon aromas comprising a spicy, exotic nose. Black plum fruit melds with white pepper and crushed herbs, diving into tangy strawberry and sandalwood incense notes on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This rosé gets its pretty eye-of-the-partridge color from having undergone cold soaking. Dry, soft and subtle, it shows peach, vanilla and spice flavors. Great with cioppino or grilled salmon.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"Aromas of underbrush, tilled soil and ripe black fruit lead the nose. The palate doles out ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, coffee and a confectionary note alongside ripe tannins. A licorice note marks the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Showing the typical power and concentration of the 2010 vintage, this is a dense and structured wine. Good acidity and black plum flavors show through the big tannic texture and dry core. The wine still needs to age so drink from 2018. This is a 60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc blend from Mallet Frères.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Dry, lightly oaked and mild on the nose, this Pinot from a cold vintage offers modest but honest plum and raspberry scents in front of a crisp, juicy, fresh palate. Flavors of raspberry and red plum come with dusting of spice on a zesty, light-bodied finish.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir
"This is a dense, concentrated and expressive wine, although it's still young and promises more beauty and elegance with age. Aromas of African violets and cocoa nibs marry harmoniously with the fleshy black-fruit core. Jammy, ripe plum and cherry flavors lead the lush and slightly creamy palate, transitioning into notes of roasted coffee and chocolate, and finally ending on a sweet toasted-oak and baking-spice accent. It's richly delicious now, but patience will also be rewarded; try after 2016.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rhône-style Red Blend
"A small addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot don't rein in any of this wine's significant power, highlighted in plummy licorice and inviting aromas of chocolate that mellow on the palate, revealing a thick and rich explosion of ripeness with a concentrated finish.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Dense and extracted, this offers aromas of black cherry, ground pepper, pine sap and dried herb. The palate delivers blackberry syrup, dried cherry, mocha and clove alongside grainy tannins. Drink through 2019.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"This is a good wine for enjoying now with Mexican food or a barbecue. It's dry and briary, with black pepper-accented cola, blackberry and, currant flavors.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Fragrant aromas of green pear and apple mix with a riper peach note on the nose. With 10% aged in French oak, this Chardonnay trends toward the unoaked style—light bodied, crisp and fruit-forward. The streamlined, citrusy palate takes on a crunchy pear flavor, lightly dusted with talc.",US-Virginia-Chardonnay
"This LBV could be aged. It has a real youthful feel, and its ripe black-fruit flavors are full of complex sweetness and edged with tannins. It has weight, richness and a generous mouthfeel.",Portugal-Port-Port
"This riserva opens with a textured, granular mouthfeel that is packed tight with leather, tobacco, dried berry and cola flavors. The close is fresh and menthol-driven.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"The wine is all about fresh apples and pears, with just a hint of smokiness and mineral texture. Crisp, with great acidity, it's ready to drink now, bright, full in the mouth and very fruity.",France-Beaujolais-Chardonnay
"Very much like the fine 2009, the winery's new Chardonnay is bone dry and austere, like a Chablis. Highly minerally, with mouthwatering acidity, the fruit flavors veer toward Meyer lemons and limes.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Shooting for wine that will age for at least 15 years, this has too much wood for its own good. Dark and spicy with tough toast, it will likely remain that way. Somebody tried too hard.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Lightly green aromas of herbal red plum and cinnamon lead to a hard, closed, edgy palate. Minimal red-fruit flavors are herbal and finish scratchy, tannic and raw.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"No specific blend is listed on this delicious wine—in the past it's been Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and Sémillon. Luscious, ripe fruit flavors of grapefruit, melon and loads of fresh pear combine to show a wonderfully fresh and tasty white wine. The acids lift up the brightness, and this round and fruity style is a can't miss proposition.",US-Washington-White Blend
"This new Mistral is roughly half Grenache, the rest a mix of Syrah and four other grapes. It's immediately appealing, loaded with brown spices, plum cake, raisins and chocolate.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Apple and white fruit aromas set up a balanced, reasonably full palate, with banana, creamy oak, vanilla and apple flavors. It feels solid and round, with a clean finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"Sharp, simple and candied, with blackberry jam and cola flavors. The tannins are rugged, and the wine finishes with a scour of acidity. Seems at its best now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This partially oak-aged expression of Pinot Bianco from cool-climate Alto Adige (in the far north of Italy) offers a lovely texture that is creamy and smooth at the same time. Measured aromas include melon, apricot, grapefruit and a touch of vanilla spice.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Bianco
"Smells and tastes Porty, with caramelized raisin and black currant flavors. And with nearly 17% alcohol, it's hot.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Subtitled Vin de Lune, moon wine, because the grapes were harvested at night. That has allowed the wine to preserve its freshness with lively acidity and fresh red currant flavors.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"A 100% varietal expression of the grape, this is soft and simple, medium bodied and quite tannic, with highlights of green herb and tomato leaf.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Pressed blueberry, black pepper and pencil lead show on this nose of this 50% Grenache and 50% Syrah blend by former football pro Terry Hoage, who recently renamed his brand. The palate on this juicy yet spicy bottling offers smoked meats and beef-jerky flavors with tar, black pepper and tangy boysenberry.",US-California-Grenache-Syrah
"Calcaia is an elegant dessert wine from Umbria that has seen botrytis. Delicate aromas of candied fruit, honey and apricot make for an impressive bouquet.",Italy-Central Italy-White Blend
"Produced in the hills above the small town of Castillon, the wine is fruity with a stalky texture and some firm tannins. It is balanced, though, with its acidity and black-currant flavors and should mature well over the next few years. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine has a pretty, honey-like element to the nose that is backed by chamomile tea and dried herbs. The ensemble gives it interesting personality and a clean, fresh dimension.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"The ??? Pinot from Ayoub is a true mystery wine, made with fruit sourced from unnameable but exceptionally high-end sources. Flavors are subtle and elegant, with lovely floral top notes over firm, well-balanced fruit and chewy tannins. Still quite young and compact, this wine needs another five years at a minimum to blossom. Drink 2020–2030.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"The charms of this full-bodied wine are mainly in the substantial and viscous texture, while mild mineral and apricot flavors provide subtle backup. Far from being simply fruity, the style emphaizes the soothing, mouth-coating feel of the wine.",US-California-Chenin Blanc
"There's a bit of spritz and very light flavors of fresh pear. A lick of honey winds through and continues on into the finish, offsetting a slightly bitter note.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Ripe in style, this is a full-bodied, creamy wine. It has fine acidity despite its rich texture and generous, warm feel. On the finish, the wine remains full and open in character.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Light and somewhat neutral smelling, with peach and pool water aromas. It's fresh, tangy and light on its feet, with citrus, melon and mild pithy flavors. Finishes similar, with lasting freshness, mild bitter notes and varietal correctness.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Torrontés
"Clean Slate offers forward, fresh grapefruit and lemon flavors with just a hint of smoke in this off-dry Riesling. It's a straightforward yet consistently elegant wine for everyday enjoyment.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Strong wood flavors dominate the red berry fruits. It is tough at the edges, but the heart does show some potential fruitiness. It will need time to round out. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Brilliant gold in color, this wine by Santa Barbara's pioneering Rhône house shows pressed white flowers, bruised apple and a touch of iodine on the nose. It's quite heavy on the viscous palate, with a sense of fish oil as well as caramelized apple, iodine, roasted almonds, singed marshmallow and dried apricot. It's a very meaty white wine.",US-California-Roussanne
"In contrast to many of the other wines, this one starts off tight, with only faint lime and mineral notes on the nose. But it blossoms with air, stubbornly yielding up taut citrus flavors that flow over the palate with an almost gritty, powdered-rock texture.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Solo comes from the winery's estate vineyard, the third vineyard planted to Cabernet Sauvignon in the Stags Leap District. It is elegant and old-school in style, pretty in violets and red berries, with a juicy, soft texture. It begs for steak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Meaty and savory in style, with Syrah clearly playing a big part in the blend (70%; the other 30% is Grenache). This wine delivers authentic Southern Rhône Syrah flavors of asphalt, tapenade and espresso, devoid of any overt wood, remaining firm on the finish. Drink now–2014.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Concentrated berry aromas meet with bubblegum and hibiscus on the simple and pleasant nose of this pink bottling from the winery's Los Alamos Ranch, which Louis Lucas planted decades ago. The palate shows tart pink grapefruit juice, but is rounded out by a soft texture.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The classic skittle bottle shape, familiar from restaurant tables throughout Provence, reflects this wine's character. Lightly peppery and spicy, it has attractive and perfumed acidity.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Blackberry and clove aromas are elevated by a hint of lavender on the nose. These notes carry through to the palate as well, along with a grape soda flavor. Smooth tannins and ample acidity struggles to match the larger body. A hollow midpalate leads to a tart fruit finish.",US-Virginia-Cabernet Franc
"The aromas are bright, with notes of savory herb, orange peel, cranberry and spice. The flavors are higher in acidity, tart and puckering, with orange-peel flavors lingering on the finish. The tannins seem a little crunchy right now but should soften with some additional time in the bottle. It's a stylistically unique wine for the state. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is the midrange wine in Danie de Wet's clutch ofChardonnays, proof that the hot climate of Robertson is no bar to making fine white wines. With its steely character, this is the most French wine, almost Chablis in style, from this producer. Spices, green plums, kiwifruit are all there, as is fresh, crisp acidity.",South Africa-Robertson-Chardonnay
"The wine is fermented in steel tanks and aged for a few months in neutral oak barrels. The result is dry, tart and complex, with gooseberry, green grass and white pepper flavors, enriched with hints of golden mangoes and vanilla.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Dry, lush and soft, with richly extracted black currant, beef jerky, sweet milk chocolate and anise flavors that go on and on. Has a prickly, peppery feeling that's a little hot.",US-California-Syrah
"Underbrush, oak, mature black fruit and a leather note lead the nose on this wine. The ripe palate begins with lush black cherry accented with grilled sage, thyme, black pepper, vanilla and mocha. But the fleeting tannins, soft acidity and lack of energy show this is already evolved. Drink through 2019.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Apparently the Oregon Trail leads down to Santa Rosa, where this wine was cellared and bottled. Long-distance travel aside, it's a good wine for gulping, matching red currant fruit to a generous wash of black tea and tobacco. Flavors pull up a bit short, but by then the next swallow is already on the way.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"There's a wildland, coastal mountain taste to this wine, which brims with bone-dry, exotic, woodsy tastes of wild forest cherries, fennel, balsam, cola, volcanic minerals, raw beef and Asian spices, not to mention the sweet veneer of sandalwood. It's utterly distinct from other Pinots in its almost feral complexity, a wine that changes with every sniff and sip. Should develop through 2014. This is a great price for a Pinot Noir of this integrity and interest. Only 152 cases were produced, but it's worth the search.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Soft notes of ripe Comice pear are laced with fresh lemon hints in this Pinot Gris that is both textured and refreshing, a great example of the 2014 zestiness. Dry, precise and lasting, it is lovely now but will develop. Drink now until 2020.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"You get plenty of rich, ripe cherry, red currant, cappuccino and peppery spice flavors in this briskly tannic, dry young Merlot. The mouthfeel is a little rugged, though. Drink up.",US-California-Merlot
"Made of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot, this opens with delicate black-skinned fruit and tilled earth aromas. The straightforward palate delivers ripe black plum and exotic spice flavors, smoothed out by ripe tannins. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Organically grown, this fruit is from the estate vineyard in the Chehalem Mountains. Old vine elegance and subtlety are much in evidence, even in this bottling from a difficult, rain-soaked vintage. It's a delicate wine that nonetheless offers persistent, complex flavors: strawberry and sour cherry, dried Italian herbs and a finishing lick of chocolate.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A bit of a muted nose on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (42%), Merlot (24%), Petit Verdot (22%), Cab Franc (11%) and Malbec (1%) out of the Livermore Valley. A good balance of fruit and tannic power here, but not a ton of depth. The finish drops off a bit, too.",US-California-Meritage
"Leather, cheesy oak, baked raspberry and mild herbal notes create a good bouquet. This is somewhat raw, choppy and pinched in feel, while flavors of loamy black fruits hint at prune. Finishing flavors of coffee and spice are offset by residual juicy acidity.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"A slight vanilla accent glimmers through the fresh fruit aromas of pear and apple flesh. Round and ripe on the palate, the finish takes a seductive tropical-fruit turn before finally landing on a clean, clementine citrus note.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Chardonnay
"Pure notes of tart but ripe, red apple shine on nose and palate. They pervade this fresh, clean and dry wine with immense, appetizing juiciness. There is concentration and joy at the heart, backed by focussed, taut acidity that brightens everything. The lemon zest on the finish is impressive and long.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"This is very floral and fruity--almost to the point of being candied and artificial--with prominent flavors of cherries and bubble gum, yet finishing dry. A decent summertime quaff.",France-Provence-Rosé
"About 30% was aged in new French oak, the rest in neutral wood. A bit closed, it offers tight, tart rhubarb and cherry fruit, with a fading wash of milk chocolate. It's a lighter style in a lighter vintage, but nicely balanced and drinking well.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Rich and 100% barrel fermented, this delicious Chardonnay is thick and luscious, with buttered nuts, pineapple and candied citrus; a really concentrated wine with exceptional depth and density for the price. The oak is present and accounted for, but not at all intrusive; it's really a generously fruity wine with a big mid-palate. Outstanding value.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Jammy raspberry and plum aromas come with accents of dusty herbs and black licorice. A saturated, lush, jammy palate features soft, baked flavors of cassis and wild berry, while the finish delivers mint, chocolate and lasting berry ripeness. Drink through 2019.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Only their second vintage of Finger Lakes Riesling, Long Island's Macari Vineyards makes quite a splash with this beautifully honeyed yet dry and fruitful wine. Richly textured with notes of yellow freesia and preserved peach, it finishes elegantly on a subtly astringent black tea note.",US-New York-Riesling
"This is a soft, gentle wine, made for immediate consumption. It features bright cherry and pear-drop aromas and pleasant, if somewhat simple, fruit flavors. Two-thirds Grenache, with the rest being a blend of Syrah, Carignan, Cinsault and Mourvèdre.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Bold lychee, honeydew and stone-fruit perfume adorns this varietally classic Gewürztraminer. Its tastes just a shade off dry, its hibiscus-nectar sweetness accenting sunny tangerine and peach flavors. Sunny acidity and integrated alcohol tie the package together smartly. Drink now through 2020.",US-New York-Gewürztraminer
A firm touch of toast and vanilla gives this rich wine a rounded character. Honey and creamed apple flavors give further generosity. Yellow fruits at the end are balanced with a more zingy lemon and pink grapefruit acidity. Drink this ripe wine from 2017.,France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Sweet oak tones of cinnamon, ripe cherry and raspberry are delivered via a beautifully intense bouquet. This is a Brunello with tight tannins, fresh acidity and solid structure.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"There's a slightly aged and distinctive nose of sour cranberry and anise on this wine from the family who's owned San Antonio Winery in Los Angeles since 1917. The cooker fruit sense continues to the palate, where lingering root vegetable flavors and mocha mix with Eastern European spices.",US-California-Merlot
"This lovely understated wine shows elegance and grace within a framework of dark red cherry, cedar and dried sage—the herbal tones perfectly calibrated. Firm wood tannin is complementary instead of distracting, playing a supportive role in the wine's tenacious grip of spice.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Smoky and floral on the nose, and then thick and ripe in the mouth, with syrup to go with medicinal berry flavors. It's chewy and dense, with chocolate, cream and vanilla to the finish. A bit plodding, but its full weight, feel and depth of fruit push it along.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This wine seems quite evolved for its age, with aromas of leather and dried cranberry. It's light bodied with gritty tannins.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon

"The celebrated Ruffino estate in Tuscany enters the popular Prosecco category with this brand-new wine. An Extra Dry expression with a tiny hint of sweetness, this bright sparkler delivers pear, honey and sweet peach.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Rosé should be dry, delicate and crisp in acidity. This Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah blend succeeds on two of those levels, but not dryness. The raspberry fruit has a simple jamminess that's almost dessert-style.",US-California-Rosé
"Pretty and floral, juicy and substantial, this wine delivers in flavor and texture, conveying caramel, baked pear and pineapple. Notable oak wraps around the fruit, ending with hazelnut and nutmeg.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Black-fruit and red-berry aromas come with notes of green tobacco and freshly mowed grass. The palate on this blend of Tempranillo with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon is a bit scratchy, with lightly herbal flavors of blackberry, wood grain and pepper. A drying, tannic finish features notes of tobacco and oak-driven chocolate. Drink through 2024.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
This is a fresh wine that also has a strong sense of structure. It's textured with white fruits coming through a nervy acidity and minerality. Hints of wood are tantalizing and round the wine out at the end.,France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This Crianza is strapping on the nose, with fairly big but not overdone black-fruit aromas. A ripe, chewy palate with moderate tannins holds peppery wild berry flavors that settle on plum. A dark, toasty, peppery finish is mild and smooth. Overall, this offers a lot to like.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Bolla is an iconic name for Soave and this bright wine delivers all the ease and good cheer you can expect from an easy Italian white. Citrus and stone fruit aromas are followed by a soft, slightly sweet mouthfeel.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"Very delicious in terms of sheer flavor. Floods the mouth with ripe, rich black cherries, black raspberries, milk chocolate, licorice and spicy, oaky vanilla. Could have more structure, though. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine opens with intense floral aromas that recall room freshener and cold cream. The dense palate offers exotic fruit and flavors that suggest canned peaches alongside a hint of clove. It has a bitter, nutty finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Gewürztraminer
"This Livermore producer has sourced from Livermore and Amador County—both Portuguese varieties and Cabernet Sauvignon—to make this Port-style wine, a mouthful of caramel toffee melted and toasty. A hint of marshmallow's there too.",US-California-Port
"Camelot is a bold blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot that shows great balance and elegant composure. It's not overdone or jammy, despite the hot climate that shaped it. Instead, it shows focus and precision in its blackberry, cherry, oak spice and cinnamon notes.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"Ripe, raisiny, lightly baked aromas set up a full palate with tomatoey acidity. Flavors of baked plum and cherry are backed by notes of mocha, tobacco, vanilla and herbs. A long, balanced, cedary finish helps this along. Drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"Although this is comprised of more than 50% Syrah, this five grape Rhône-style blend seems more influenced by the Grenache. Plenty of mixed berry flavors surface quickly, proving to be bright and spicy, before running into some drying tannins that are marked with a green edge.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Muddled, oily aromas are funky for certain. This blend of Riesling, Albariño and Savagnin feels round and melony, but ultimately soft. Floral, pickled melon flavors come in front of a briny, tropical-leaning finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-White Blend
"On first pour, this wine is still in its shell with aromas of huckleberries, dried herbs and plums, with savory notes lurking in the background. It's fleshy in feel with plush, pure blue fruit and smoked meat flavors that linger on the finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This single-parcel wine is rich and with layers of wood aging in the flavor, giving a spicy slightly toasty character. Behind that, there is a more herbal green-fruit character that is crisp with acidity and with a tangy, zesty aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",France-Southwest France-Sauvignon Blanc
"Soft and rounded, this has a raspberry flavor and a fine, full feel. It has the tannic structure of the vintage, which fits into the sumptuous, cushioned texture.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This wine is velvety smooth, thick and savory—a complex and nuanced celebration of a great site that's meticulously farmed. It unspools black tea, clove and spicy cola flavors as it opens.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"There is a racy, spicy, biting edge to this young Pinot that nicely expresses the Chehalem Mountains AVA terroir, authoritative and unapologetic for the herbal side of the grape. It lingers and opens into a mélange of red fruits, forest, leaf and loam, still stiff and compact after hours of breathing.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A sunny and polished wine, it unfolds with ripe citrus and stone fruit sensations that carry over to the savory palate along with saline and a hint of mineral. The juicy fruit flavors are balanced by bright acidity.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Grillo
"A creamy wine, with fresh acidity touched with spicy wood. It has the comfortable, plump feel of Meursault, but with some crispness. There are good citrus and white fruit flavors, even apricots, and then the acidity leaves a lifted, lively finish.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"It's all about flashy fruit in this ripe Pinot Noir. Enormously concentrated with raspberry, date and cherry flavors and hints of spicy bacon and raisins.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Young and tight, this requires aggressive aeration before it begins to show much flavor. It's worth the effort, as it evolves into a dense, delicious wine that marries its juicy stone fruits to a rich mix of vanilla, coconut and caramel components from the barrel aging. Drink 2018 to 2030.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Viognier is half the blend, with the rest Roussanne and Riesling, yielding a delightfully aromatic, lightly honeyed wine, with a lush array of ripe fruits. Apricot, papaya, pineapple and banana are all here, with supporting acidity. Overall, this is one of the most delicious and unique white wines in Washington.",US-Washington-White Blend
"This aromatic brooder shows notes of dark cherry, barrel spice, pencil lead, vanilla and herb, along with a light floral note. The palate has nuance and detail with balance that is impressive. Give it some time in the cellar to strut its stuff. Best after 2023.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon

"High toned aromas mark the nose of this wine, including dried herb, fresh plum, huckleberry and spice. Its purple fruit flavors are rich and lush, with a pleasing purity that carries through the finish. It's uncharacteristic of Sangiovese but brings undeniable appeal.",US-Washington-Sangiovese
"A wisp of smoke lends a sultry tone to fresh pear in this dry, supple wine. It's ripe and rich on the palate, but maintains the lean, steely acidity ubiquitous to this vintage. Finishes long with rolling mineral notes.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"A dry Gewürztraminer, more fruity than many, showing intense spice and pepper as well as sultana and pear flavors. It has concentration, a dense texture, and delicious perfumes.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Robust in body and alcohol, this lavish Pinot Noir rosé offers juicy blackberry and cherry flavors. Dry in style with a rich, slightly dense texture, it suggests pairing with a full meal rather than enjoying as an apéritif.",US-New York-Rosé
"Near the town of Graton, this site provides cool-climate structure and personality to this wine. Olive, fig and minerality of the wet-stone variety are lifted by aromas of beautiful white flowers. Fully balanced, with a voluptuous edge, it's powerful and pretty.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The aromas are light initially, with notes of cocoa, herb, barrel spice and cherry not yet fully ready to reveal their charms. The cherry and bittersweet chocolate flavors are backed by lightly grainy tannins that need some time to unwind. The wood is intense at present but there are good things underneath.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Heady aromas of white spring flower and mature apple carry through to the creamy palate along with ripe pear and citrus notes. It's balanced, with vibrant acidity and an elegant perlage that lead into the dry, refreshing finish.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Chorey vineyards, on the plain close to Beaune, often produce good-value wines. This attractive wine is a good example from an uneven vintage. It has structure and fruit, maybe not enough, along with a fresh, tangy character. It is developing fast, so drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Boysenberry, blueberry and black cherry aromas lead on the nose of this wine, with a touch of warmth and chocolaty sensation following behind. The palate veers more towards red-fruit flavors, with a thin midpalate and an astringent close.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This wine is full bodied, complex and layered, offering a good example of a flavorful, intricate wine that wins fans by finesse, not force. Cedar, mint and tobacco animate the aromas, and lightly tart blackberry and black plum flavors fill the midpalate. With a moderate dose of fine tannins, it has the grip for juicy beef and pork pairings.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This lively, medium-bodied and well-balanced wine smells of raspberries and dried herbs. It tastes invitingly fresh, combining bright fruit with earthy and savory accents. The color is relatively light, matching the overall tangy personality.",US-California-Zinfandel
"While this is a Moscato, it's unlike most of the Moscatos out there on the market. For one thing, it's bone dry. Without the distracting taste of honey, you can really taste the underlying citrus fruits and white flowers, as well as a stimulating minerality. The acidity is excellent.",US-California-Moscato
"This deep golden, almost amber-colored wine is showing signs of oxidation. It has an unusual and intensely balsamic nose while the palate offers muddled sensations of eucalyptus, lemon drop, mineral and a hint of candied ginger but no fruit richness.",Italy-Southern Italy-Falanghina
"Flowery and easygoing on the bouquet, this is taught, lemony and wiry on the palate. Flavors of gooseberry, lime and apple feature cleansing acids and a persistent, citrusy tang. A blend of 80% Xarel-lo and 20% Riesling.",Spain-Catalonia-White Blend
"This big, jammy Syrah from the Maipo Alto is typically leathery and spicy smelling. The body on this wine is fat and weighty, while flavors of buttery oak and spiced berry meld together if given time in the glass. On the finish, this is oaky and herbal tasting, with a creamy feel.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Syrah
"Tastes fairly straightforward now, with fresh, vigorous blackberry, blueberry, cherry, anise and mocha flavors that have a minerally bite. The tannins are tough, gritty and dry, as befits a young Cabernet grown on Diamond Mountain. Needs time, and lots of it. Hold until after 2016, at least.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Whereas many Syrahs from this vintage from the Rocks District show more fruit than usual, this wine is clearly rooted in the stones. It's aromatically expressive with black olive, crushed flowers, mineral, black pepper and an earthy funk. Flavors are silky soft in feel, with a well-balanced mixture of fruit and savory notes that leads to a lingering finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Ripe yellow fruits give this wine a soft and rich character. With a tangy, citrus edge it is also crisp and fresh. The combination makes for a lively, light wine that is ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Pretty aromatics include balsam wood, blackberry and blueberry. The palate is lush but well structured, with bullish berry, chocolate and creamy oak flavors. Minty and super spicy and long on the finish, with a lasting dark toastiness.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Syrah
"Intense aromas of peach and lemon-lime are softened by notes of concrete and flint. On the palate, there is a muskiness that is eventually overpowered by guava, peach and sour apple, finishing tart.",US-Virginia-White Blend
"A red color and a bouquet equal to a cloud of char and berry fruit form the greeting on this Pinot. Flavors of rose water, herbs, wood spice, red plum and raspberry storm onto an acid-driven finish that hangs around with complexities. This is not Chacra's best PN but it's still impressive.",Argentina-Other-Pinot Noir
"A bitter cherry flavor is balanced by the firm, tannic structure. With its appropriate weight and juicy, spicy acidity, it's attractive now but also has aging potential. Screwcap.",Austria-Burgenland-Zweigelt
"This wine is a blend of Grenache (44%), Mourvèdre (22%), Syrah (14%), Cinsault (13%) and Counoise. It delivers aromas of red fruit, celery stalk, white pepper and herb that lead to ripe full-bodied dark-fruit flavors that offer a lot of enjoyment.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is the first wine to be blended each year, though it is not labeled a reserve. The new vintage has amazing depth, running down through a litany of red and black fruits, into veins of earth and tannin and graphite, and finishing with densely textured barrel notes of toast, coffee and bitter chocolate. Beautifully proportioned, deep and cellarworthy.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Bright fruit flavors light up this tart, medium-bodied wine. It smells like raspberries and red cherries, tastes crisp and bright and has a light nip of cranberry-like astringency.",US-California-Barbera
"There's an intense minerality throughout this dry, elegantly structured wine. It's boldly concentrated with yellow peach and quince flavors, yet chiseled with streaks of lime acidity, lanolin and steel. Finishes long with a fragrant spray of honeysuckle.",US-New York-Riesling
"This cool-vintage Cabernet is a bit grassy and herbal on the nose, with standard berry aromas lurking in the backdrop. A tight, raw, driving palate feels focused but a touch raw, while herbal, dried flavors of plum and raspberry end with peppery spice, minty flavors and hard residual acidity.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Brushy sage meets succulent blackberry, blueberry and tar in this impressive wine, which offers generous structure and complex tannin. Though juicy and decidedly enjoyable now, it will benefit from further cellaring; best 2022 through 2032.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Here's a bright, tart, wonderfully drinkable young Sauvignon Blanc with some real complexity. It's savory in citrus, gooseberry, green apple and vanilla flavors, with just a touch of creamy oak.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Pa' Riondo is a fresh, fruit-forward Ripasso with loads of cherry, blackberry and cassis on the bouquet. That natural freshness continues to the mouth, where the wine shows good acidity backed by hearty concentration and density.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This is a muddled, roughly textured effort, rich and ripe in cinnamon apple that hides its oak use well.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Chocolate, mocha and espresso mark this big, bold and full-bodied wine that includes a touch of Petit Verdot in the mix. Smoky and smooth, it's ready for cigars or hearty winter platters.",US-California-Malbec

"This blended trocken offers plenty of Pfalz character at a reasonable price. Brined peaches and honey show the warmth and minerality of the region in a flattering light, carried by a rich texture and a long finish.",Germany-Pfalz-Riesling
"Robust tannins and a nice character of plum, cherry and spice recommend this wine, though it has a slightly one dimensional simplicity to it. Pair with burgers and grilled lamb to bring out the good spice notes.",US-New York-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This hallmark Chianti Classico boasts a heady perfume of violet, underbrush, peach blossom and clove. The palate delivers bright red fruit, pepper and cinnamon with crushed cherry in the forefront. It's nicely balanced and should develop complexity over the next few years but is already delicious.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"The aromas are bright, with notes of lime leaf, apricot, citrus peel, flowers and lime. It drinks off dry, with abundant stone-fruit flavors that provide plenty of pleasure.",US-Washington-Riesling
"La Nerthe's late-ripening Mourvèdre typically shines the brightest in warm vintages, which 2008 was not. The result is a leathery, peppery wine with rather crisp, cherry-inflected fruit. Drink it over the next several years.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Dark berry, underbrush and tobacco aromas lead the nose of this vibrant, structured wine while the palate doles out black cherry, fresh raspberry, licorice and clove. Fresh acidity and supple tannins balance the juicy flavors. Drink through 2018.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This is an interesting but not perfectly balanced rosé from the celebrated Irpinia area of Campania in southern Italy. The nose of this pretty, pale pink wine opens with sweet aromas of berries and roses. But the mouthfeel shows sharp sourness.",Italy-Southern Italy-Rosé
"New wood aromas and flavors make this selection seem dominated by toast, giving it a dry, tannic character. The ripe plum fruit is submerged and is likely to surface only after 3–4 years of aging when a powerful, upfront wine will emerge.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Schist soil is characteristic of the Muscadet Sèvre et Maine region. It gives texture to a wine such as this, with its tight, mineral character and great freshness. This complex, densely structured wine is packed with very crisp fruit and lively acidity. This is the perfect wine for Muscadet's natural partner, shellfish.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"Bouncy berry and cherry aromas are more or less standard for basic Garnacha. This wine feels a bit gummy and grabby, but not sticky. Lightly herbal, minty dark-berry flavors finish herbal, chocolaty and a touch green.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"This simple blend of Zinfandel, Syrah and several other red varieties is rich in red berry jam and spice flavors. As the name implies, it's a pantry-style red for everyday drinking.",US-California-Red Blend

"This bottling, from a vineyard planted in 1972, is still fresh despite being six-years-old, and represents a much lighter style of Cabernet Sauvignon that goes great with a chill. Aromas of strawberry, pepper, bay leaf, leather and black pepper lead into a tart and tangy palate, which shows a light hint of barnyard funk.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Light and fruity, this is an immediately attractive, fragrant, off-dry wine. With its red berry flavors, it tastes warm and inviting. The touch of acidity reinforces the bright drinkability.",Portugal-Lisboa-Rosé
"It's easy to taste the fresh grape flavors in this medium-bodied, structured and appetizing wine. Good acidity and moderate tannins lift up black grape, blackberry and strawberry flavors to create very good balance.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Seamless luxury from stem to stern, this ‘baby Grange' is  impressive juice. Blackberry, menthol and smoke play unusually elegantly on the nose, the texture is velvet on the tongue with dark berry, coffee, licorice and muted black pepper flavors. The superb, very long finish combines all the elements with wonderful finesse and a rare grace. Not inexpensive, but fairly priced; you could pay twice as much for half the wine, almost any day in any fine wine store in the country. To be released 5/01.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"This wine runs the gamut of crisp, mineral flavors. It is tight, driven by green flavors and acidity, with just a touch of vanilla. As befits a Petit Chablis, there is lightness rather than weight, but it makes a delicious aperitif style of wine.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Sweaty aromas of gym bag, nettle and grapefruit come in front of a citric, astringent palate with grapefruit-like acidity. Heavy, pithy citrus flavors finish similarly.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"This is a rather big and rich wine that has a deep orange-pink color, along with quite a bit of body and red-fruit flavors. The mouthfeel is smooth, as plum and melon flavors meet soft acidity. It's more like a red wine than most of today's rosés, but is a pleasure to drink.",US-California-Rosé
"Soft, gentle and generous cherry notes color the nose and light palate. This is pliable and has pleasant edges of peppery, tingling spice and freshness.",France-Alsace-Pinot Noir
"The oak (two-thirds new French and American) leads, with aromas of cocoa, cinnamon and spice followed by plum. The palate shows an elegant styling but with good intensity to the flavors.",US-Washington-Malbec
"Made entirely with old Nerello Mascalese vines between 80 and 100-years-old, this has aromas of blue flower, ripe berry, exotic spice and a whiff of French oak. The elegant linear palate delivers red cherry, raspberry, chopped herb and star anise alongside fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. A mineral note closes the finish. Drink 2018–2025.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nerello Mascalese
"Flinty and austere in tone, this reserve-tier wine is lemony and tart, with grapefruit flavors heartily enveloped in oak.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Barley sugar and orange peel vie for attention, but both play to the tune set by the fine, distinct lemony acidity, which also provides linearity. Hints of lemon oil and honey complete the picture.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Riesling

"There's a sea of basic Cabernet that comes out of Chile every year. This is very much one of the generic, forgettable ones. Expect light cherry and cassis aromas and flavors, and a mouthfeel that's mildly acidic and scratchy.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Expressive and loaded with fruit, mineral and spice components, this powerful wine centers around dense flavors of black cherry and cassis. Threads of coffee, caramel, wet rock and citrus keep coming through, and the wine seems to gain strength as it goes. Just a hint of heat comes out in the tail end.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"The nose of those wine is fruit driven, with red apple and a riper notions of melon and strawberry. The same appetizing fruit plays on the light dry palate where some yeasty, brioche-like autolytic notes provide a sonorous counterpoint. The finish is dry, fresh and lasting.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"Soft, ripe, dominated by peaches, pears and a rounded, toasty character. The spice is dominant, giving the wine an exotic edge. The more rounded style gives concentration as well as a fine, finishing velvet texture.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Grapes from this tiny AVA frequently deliver that something extra that catapults Pinot into a higher dimension. Here, solid cherry and berry tones bear almost indefinable traces of iron, mineral and sweet hay. Delicious already, this should continue to improve through 2020.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Light in color, this wine brings pleasing, pure aromas of peppermint, strawberry, sarsaparilla and cherry. The flavors are light, elegant and juicy, providing a lot of appeal.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This is a 100% varietal wine sourced from the coveted Oakville Ranch Vineyard on the eastern edge of the appellation. Cedar, herb, meat and soy mingle around a full-bodied weight softened by the wine's classic edge, length and breadth of black fruit and vanilla oak. Drink now through 2022.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This medium-sized négociant is making an effort at upgrading its wines, and this is a solid example. Thyme and bay leaf notes mark the black cherry fruit, picking up hints of black tea that turn dusty and dry on the finish. A bit stern for the vintage, it should be consumed over the next couple of years before the fruit fades.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This has aromas suggesting forest floor, moist soil, aromatic herb and a whiff of violet. The simple, rather thin palate offers red cherry and a hint of kitchen spice framed in zesty acidity and loose knit tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A sweet cherry aroma sets the scene for this fruity, firmly structured wine. The juicy red-berry fruit is balanced by a smoky tannic character. This will be a pleasure to drink in a year, and it can also age longer.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This wine is crisp, with a mineral texture that is tight and allows for considerable citric acidity. A riper background conveys rich apple flavors and a taut, nervy, steely character. Drink this concentrated wine from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"The Crossings is based in the Awatere subregion of Marlborough, where ripening is more difficult than the main valley because of cooler temperatures. That evidently wasn't an issue in 2013, as this wine features ripe black-cherry fruit and a creamy texture. Hints of herb and cocoa chime in on the supple finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"Guigal's luxury cuvée from Condrieu is a great success in 2008, marrying richness and power with hints of honeysuckle, toasted nuts and apricot. It's full bodied, creamy in texture and tremendously long on the finish. Drink now–2016, and possibly beyond.",France-Rhône Valley-Viognier
"The cool Côte de Lechet, facing north, produces a classically steely Chablis. This is still young, very tight and nervy, its acidity prominent even though the texture is ripe. Aging will bring balance between the crisp character and the richer green and white fruits. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"The aromatics are faint on this wine, and the taste puckeringly tannic and raisiny with a strong taste of toffee on the finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Rooty aromas of raisin and stewed plum are a touch hot as this tips the scale at 15.5%. High in acidity and low in body fat, the palate is linear. Short berry and root beer flavors are mature. Hollow on the finish. Drink through 2019.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"The purity of the nose is glacial and utterly clean-cut. There is an enticing headiness to the lemon and bergamot aromas. This is uncompromisingly citric, with a life force that can revive every single nerve in our body. The citrus spectrum gets its full due in a wine that sparkles and glistens with purity and life itself.",Austria-Kamptal-Riesling
"Big, big, big! This is a mountain-grown Bordeaux blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon, and it's tremendous all around. Explodes in jammy blackberries, blueberries, currants, cherries and mocha, and the tannins are strong, but refined. Combines elegance and power, and should develop over the next 6–8 years.",US-California-Red Blend
"Blossomy and pert, this is an elegant rosé sparkling offering fresh, juicy cherry and raspberry flavors. Bristling acidity and tiny, persistent pétillance invigorate the palate. Made from a blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon vinified by indigenous yeast.",US-New York-Sparkling Blend
"Peach and lemon combine in this superripe Chablis. Reflecting the warm vintage, the wine is soft, laced with lime juice acidity and hinting at vanilla and thyme. Round and warm, it is not typical Chablis, much more akin to a Meursault.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A lightweight wine, almost tangy in its freshness. Wild strawberry flavors give a great liveliness to a wine that is taut in its acidity.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Young and fruity, this is a soft, citrus and apple flavored wine. Attractive acidity is enhanced by the light minerality and tangy aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Alsace-Riesling

Floral notes enhance the pear flavors and lend playfulness to the rounded but light body that also offers edges of spicy white pepper.,Austria-Weinviertel-Grüner Veltliner
"Butter, sea salt, hard caramel candy, pan-seared white peach and poached apple aromas show on the nose on this wine by veteran Bryan Babcock. Once sipped, the wine tightens around a citrus pith, showing yogurt, iodine and lots of acidic energy, as well as more seared pome fruit on the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Though labeled Columbia Valley, this is in fact 100% Merlot from the estate vineyards on Red Mountain. It's chewy and tannic, as is often the case with Red Mountain reds, with black cherry and cassis fruit wrapped by astringent tannins hinting at dark chocolate. In short, a fine steak wine, that needs some fat to cut the tannins.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Suave aromas of bramble and red berries meet with chipped slate, a touch of anise and pressed lilacs on this nose of this blend of 37% Grenache, 29% Mourvèdre, 13% Syrah, 10% Counoise, 6% Cinsault and 5% Carignane. Bright cranberry and red cherry fruit pop on the palate, which is bolstered by fennel, black peppercorns and dried rose petals.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend

"Medium in body, this deals a slender peach flavor, bearing acids that become jumpy toward the finish.",US-Virginia-Viognier
"An earthy but fruit-drenched character makes this wine an enchanting and multi-layered marvel.

The texture is warm and velvety, with a finish that lingers on the verge of sweetness.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Strong and ripe with Zinny flavor— intense wild berry and cherry fruit as well as a briary, brambly mouthfeel. High alcohol gives it a glycerine richness.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A little heavy, thick and jammy, like melted blackberry jelly mixed with alcohol. Okay with pizza, burgers and such.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Vanilla and baking spices frame blueberry and plum fruit in this rich, velvety offering. It's slightly fuller and bolder than Colombo's 2014 La Louvée, but also less precise and perfumed. Drink now–2030.",France-Rhône Valley-Syrah
"While this is currently a tough proposition, the inherent fruitiness of this structured wine augurs well for its future. With berry fruits under the dark tannins and some slight bitterness from wood aging, it needs time. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Coming in at a low (for Washington) alcohol level for this variety, this 100% Grenache shows light aromas of mint and other herbs with elusive raspberry and plum accents. It's medium bodied with an elegant, supple feel, showing little obvious new-oak influence to the red fruit flavors. A very intriguing wine where the texture plays a starring role in the show.",US-Washington-Grenache
"This solid, mainstream Zinfandel displays blackberry fruit and some creamy notes on the nose. Well-defined, dark berry flavors with white pepper and leather accents mark the palate. The mouthfeel is even and the finish here is brisk, tart and juicy. A touch less oak might let the fruit shine a bit more.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A funky, lean wine that's all over the place. The nose is fiery, with cardamom and notes of sweet peppers and candied berries. It feels clampy but juicy, with flavors of cumin, cardamom, sour plum and raspberry. It finishes acidic.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"For the first time this reserve-level Gamache Cabernet includes grapes from the Ciel du Cheval vineyard as well as both the Champoux and estate vineyards. It's 100% varietal, drawing upon equal portions of fruit from all three, and it's a magnificent combination. Powerful, sleek, dense and textural, the wine explodes from the glass, muscular and thick with black fruits and ripe tannins. Highlights of black tea, espresso and smoke add layers of interest to a lengthy finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Seemingly fully mature, this wine features lots of savory, meaty notes to go along with dried fruit aromas, then adds brighter, tart berry flavors on the palate. Vanilla, tobacco and crisp acids seem to be taking control of the finish, so drink up before the fruit fades.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Straightforward berry aromas come with modest herbal shadings. Feels edgy, lively and alert, with briny red-berry, spice and oaky flavors. Finishes minty and meaty, with mild oak bringing it home. Standard but good.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley-Carmenère
"Smoky leaf tobacco aromas are typical of young Cabernet Franc. And this wine, aged only in tank, is certainly much too young. It's full of brittle tannins and acidity that needs to soften. Wait until late 2015 before drinking.",France-Loire Valley-Cabernet Franc
"The aromas bring notes of milk chocolate, spice and red fruit, along with high-toned vanilla accents. The fruit and barrel flavors are plush and full, while still showing a lovely sense of balance.",US-Washington-Merlot
"With quite a bit of residual sugar, this Riesling is sweet, but balanced with crisp acidity that makes it clean and zesty. The flavors are of peaches, apricots, candied ginger, honeysuckle and vanilla. Low alcohol makes it easy to drink.",US-California-Riesling
"Fragrant, smoky, oaky and seductive, this toasty wine is immediately appealing, and has been given the all-star treatment. The young vineyard offers promising fruit; its flavors light and clean, tasting of raspberries and pie cherries. Lots of oak gives it a very chocolaty finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Light and slightly spicy, this spent 15 months in one-third new French and American oak barrels, yet it comes across as a bit mild and one dimensional.",US-Oregon-Tempranillo
"Rich red fruits along with a stalky element give this wine weight and structure. It's on the dry side, with the fruit tannins and wood notes still dominant. Good acidity offers a bright aftertaste.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A tremendous wine. Made from 100% Cabernet and raised for nearly two years in 40% new French oak, it defines the ripe, hedonistic Napa style. Yet it's no mere fruit bomb, offering a tobaccoey earthiness to the berries. A touch of raisins and heat in the finish seems to limit ageability, though, so drink up.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A dark and brooding wine, it's very much a Malbec that needs to age. Solid tannins, berry fruits and concentrated structure all promise a serious wine that needs time to mature. Drink from 2017.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Toasty aromas fold in baked apple notes. Sharp, sizzling and high in acid, the palate is citric and tough to navigate. Flavors of orange, lemon and sour apple are no shock given the palate.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"Aromas of smoke, char and spice entice the nose of this zippy, medium-bodied Lemberger. The palate is crisp, offering tart black cherry and blackberry flavors fringed delicately with tannins. Finishes long, with a delicate floral note.",US-New York-Lemberger
"Concentrated and powerfully structured now, this will benefit from some time to integrate and harmonize. Currently, all of the elements are assertively upfront, with strong oaky sensations, dense and ripe black-fruit notes and firm tannins all vying for your attention. Hints of leather, bramble, licorice root and roasted cocoa nib hang in the background, waiting for their moment to shine. Try after 2016, and through 2020.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Lots of dynamics play on the nose of this wine, from chamomile flowers and daffodils to chalk, pink lemonade, cotton candy and tropical fruits. The palate is framed by a tense minerality, seasoned with flavors of lemonade, browned butter and guava.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Equal parts Syrah and Merlot (40%), this wine is finished off with Pinot Noir. Vanilla, baking spice, licorice, woodspice and cherry aromas lead to plump, tart cranberry flavors that linger. The wood is heavy at times, which is a shame as the balance of the fruit is spot on.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Ripe and fleshy in young fruit, this Cab, with minor amounts of Cab Franc and Merlot, shows black currant, plum, cherry and cedar flavors, with a dry-sweet dusting of crushed brown herbs and spices. Fairly tannic and tight now, it's balanced enough for mid-term aging. Best 2008–2012.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aged in a majority of neutral French oak, the wine has opening aromas that impart generous toasty characteristics before mellowing into nutty, vanilla swirls and a lingering taste of green apple.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A little soft and herbal, in the way of certain Sonoma Cabernets, but incredibly rich, offering a heady array of flavors. Blackberries, blueberries, chocolate, sweet red licorice, pepper and toasty oak all mingle and make the wine rewardingly delicious. Seems best now and for the next few years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Chignin is one of the cru villages of Savoie. This wine is crisp, mineral and tight, with delicate layers of lemon and grapefruit acidity. Lively and bursting with fruit, it's ready to drink.",France-France Other-Jacquère
"Made from Castelão grapes, this crisp wine has red fruits that burst out of the glass and give a lively aftertaste, with tight acidity. Drink now.",Portugal-Lisboa-Rosé
"As delicate and spry as a silken mist, this sweet-style Riesling balances honeyed apricot and peach flavors against a backdrop of intense minerality and acidity. It darts and dances on the tongue yet penetrates deeply, leaving a long lasting impression. It's approachable now, yet should improve till at least 2025.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"The entry is oaky and the fruit light; it seems a bit unbalanced. The fruit suggests pomegranate and very tart raspberry, with plenty of acid; the oak layers in thick flavors of espresso and chocolate. Tannins are stiff but not too rough; and the finish suggests that some American oak mayhave been used.",US-Washington-Merlot
"It's not easy to find mature Rioja from a great winery and a great year. This is all that; it smells of tobacco, earth and dried fruits. The palate is lively and not dying, while the flavors of cherry, raisin and marzipan are spot on. Compact and long on the finish, indicating that it still has another 10–15 years in it.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Syrah makes up more than half of this blend that also includes Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah and Malbec. The combination is medium-bodied and mixed, with baked bread and tart cranberry competing for attention. Bay leaf and dried herb also play roles, before the whole finishes light.",US-California-Red Blend
"Good berry, cherry, chocolate, tobacco and spice flavors in this Zinfandel, but it's too soft and flat in structure. It's also frankly hot, with 15.7% alcohol, and has a Porty finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Clean, simple pear, melon and apple aromas are friendly. Reasonably full and fresh on the palate, this value-priced wine tastes of tropical fruits including banana and papaya as well as honey. A slightly oily finish gives weight to closing citrus flavors.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Chardonnay
"Oddly packed in what could be a gin bottle, the wine inside is anything but peculiar. It's a serious wine with firm tannins and a dense structure. Black plum and berry fruits are powered by minerality and a solid structure. This is a wine to age for a few more years; drink from 2017.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"The winery's flagship wine, Cabernet Sauvignon makes up just over half, with the balance Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Despite its age, it starts tight as a drum, with light aromas of spice, dark cherry, coffee and dried flowers. It's full flavored, with a dazzling richness to the textured fruit and barrel notes. Best after 2021.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Dried yellow and white wild flower, flint and lychee aromas lead the nose on this structured, savory wine. The palate delivers creamy Bartlett pear, mature Granny Smith, saline and Mediterranean herb. It's round but fresh, with a mineral finish.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Carricante
"Citrus zest, pineapple and oak aromas carry over to the lean, linear palate, joining hints of toasted nut and vanilla. Brisk acidity provides the racy framework.",Italy-Lombardy-Turbiana
"The wine comes from a vineyard in the Green Valley. It's dry and balanced, with high acidity that gives the cherry and cola flavors a peppery briskness. Seems at its best now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine is pretty retrained on the nose for Condrieu, but still offers aromas of spring blossoms and white pepper. Fruit takes hold on the palate, suggesting apricot, peach and pineapple. Those flavors continue through the finish, which is silky in texture but only medium in length.",France-Rhône Valley-Viognier
"With its grey/pink color, aromas of cherry and raspberry and its fresh fruity flavor, this is a great apèritif rosé. The taste shows some caramel and sweet-ness, crispened with acidity.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"The impressive I Filari Dolcetto opens with plush, rich concentration and a dark, purplish color. The aromas are intense and immediate and the wine exhibits a velvety, dense texture in the mouth with sweet cherry and cola flavors followed by mild tannic structure.",Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto
"This honest effort at a terroir-driven Cabernet starts with currant and blackberry aromas, although they’re a little on the weak side. Nice berry and spice flavors with a dash of wood. High acidity gives it a real bite, and it finishes a little sharp as well.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"To my mind, Te Mata's strength s are in its red wines. That said, this is a solid Chardonnay. Subtle wood shadings add richness to the flavors of mandarin orange and vanilla custard before ending on a persistent citrus-oil note.",New Zealand-Hawke's Bay-Chardonnay
"This dramatically structured Cab needs time in the cellar. It straddles the old-fashioned style of long-aging and the modern style of immediate opulence. The tannins star, sticky and firm, but the wine, which contains minor amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, is so rich, so loaded in black currants, cherries, sweet ripe plums, chocolate, anise and smoky oak, that it seduces now. But best after the age of six.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This combines the sweet spiciness of oak with the apparent sweetness of the grapes in a full-bodied, extreme-flavored package. Aromas suggest charred wood, vanilla, maple syrup and cherry juice, while the flavor conveys blackberry jam.",US-California-Mourvèdre
"This vintage of Bocca di Lupo shows balance and sophistication both in terms of its aromatic intensity and overall delivery of fresh fruit and spice. Flavors of dark plum, blackberry, black espresso and hickory smoke appear on the very rich and dense finish.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"One of the best sparkling wines produced in Saumur, this is textured, nervy and crisp, full of both fruit and secondary flavors. Touches of wood from the first fermentation in barrel give complexity and spice to the fruitiness. A yeasty, toasty aftertaste shows the wine's sophistication. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay
"This wine is rich, full in the mouth and softly textured. Ripe berry fruits are cut with acidity and with pepper. The fresher character is confined to the aftertaste.",France-Provence-Rosé
Spice and some firm tannins mark this wine. It has a red-fruit character as well as a more earthy backdrop. With its structure it will need to sit until 2017.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of wild flowers, honey, lychee and oily citrus fruits announce a minerally palate with steely yet tropical flavors of citrus and lychee. This is better cut than most, with racy acidity that keeps things running on the finish. Drink now.",Argentina-Other-Torrontés
"Soft, simple and rather sweet, like a chewy candy bar of cherries, currants, cocoa and crunchy granola. High alcohol makes it a little hot and unbalanced, but it will stand up well beside a fabulous cheeseburger.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Mulchy aromas are not uncommon for rosé from Penedès. This feels full, pulpy and citrusy, with fleshy weight. Orange and grapefruit flavors finish quick.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Varietally correct aromas of peach and melon form a good opening to this mostly fresh but fading Albariño. Flavors of melon, papaya and peach are typical for the grape, and the finish is holding on but showing signs of maturation. Drink immediately.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"A taste of charcuterie gives this Syrah a meaty, sweetish mid-palate, but it manages to finish dry, with a scour of coastal acidity. The famously pure Edna Valley fruit shows up as classic blackberries, spicy and tangy, while the tannins are significant. Give the wine until 2017–2018 to try to resolve its internal difficulties.",US-California-Syrah
"It was probably the vintage, which was less than spectacular, but this wine, while a good, elegantly structured Cabernet, doesn't justify its price. It's bone dry and tannic, with flavorful blackberries, black currants, minerals and oak. A fine wine to drink with upscale fare, but the sharp finish suggests against aging.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Rich black-cherry, currant, licorice, spice and sandalwood flavors abound in this dry Merlot. It's pretty tannic, with a gum-sticking astringency. It's unlikely that this will age well, so drink it now, after decanting, and pair it with rich meats.",US-California-Merlot
"Made from 100% Petite Sirah grown in the estate vineyard, this is a massive wine. It's as big as Petite gets, filled with blackberry, blueberry, chocolate, black currant and new oak flavors. So ripe, it turns porty in the finish, but it's a good portiness, rich and heady. The official alcohol is 14.9%, but it tastes higher than that.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Clean and composed SB, with lemon-lime aromas that settle more toward lime. The palate is clean, with basic depth that allows for nice green apple and dry green-herb flavors to show themselves. A little weak on the back end, and very “liquid” due to medium concentration.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Delicately perfumed, yellow and tropical-fruit flavored, this is bright and very fruity. The citrus edge adds a further lift to this refreshing, ready-to-drink wine.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese White
"Aromas of apricot and fragrant yellow flower lead the way on this medium-bodied white. Framed in fresh acidity, the bright palate doles out ripe yellow peach, green apple, almond and a hint of mineral.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Vermentino
"Red cherry, root beer, a touch of sage and bay leaf and an shiitake-powered umami sensation decorate the nose on this wine from one of many single-vineyard expressions in this producer's portfolio. The palate shows cooked cherries and cranberries that float across a Mediterranean elements of olive, fig balsamic and menthol.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This bold, dry, firmly tannic wine will taste good now with rich foods, but could easily improve with aging through 2017. It is deeply colored, full bodied and a bit sandy in texture, yet that grip seems O.K. in this wine, balanced by the ripe fruit flavors.",US-California-Red Blend
"Extra time in bottle has proved rewarding for this varietally pure, aromatic, even pungent wine. A complex bouquet yields rose petals, sweet spices, coffee and cedar, and flavors follow through a subtle, penetrating finish. The spicy, brambly berry fruit carries a hint of brine. Drink now through 2025.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This warm-climate Sauvignon Blanc is soft and very fruity, with the merest hint of herbal character. Its juiciness, acidity and peach flavors are refreshing.",France-France Other-Sauvignon Blanc
"The least-expensive designate is also one of Sokol Blosser's best in 2012. After opening with a whiff of funk supported with a flinty hint of clay, it moves into a complex palate with both grip and definition. The acid component brings flavors of sweet citrus and orange peel, while the overall structure and pretty red fruits suggest that this is a wine to cellar. Drink now through 2024.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This wine has a generosity of tannin that can be distracting, as the rest of its boldness seeks to make room for flavors of tart cherry, leather and hint of almond extract. Medium bodied, it veers into ripe characteristics that can come off as heat, particularly on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Here is a simple, informal expression of Barbera that ushers forth bright aromas of forest fruit, cola and dried currants. Those ripe berry flavors are ultimately washed away by the wine's fresh acidity.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"Blackberry, cassis, herb and spice aromas are complete and ripe. This Cabernet-led blend is focused and direct on the palate, with berry, cassis, chocolate and oaky flavors. A similar tasting finish, with additional chocolate and creamy oak is weighty and pleasing.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Red Blend
It's not clear what separates this from some of the other estate-grown cuvées. The thin strawberry fruit accompanies rather stemmy tannins and a green vegetal streak.,US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Made without adding the customary sweetening dosage, this elegant blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco and Pinot Nero opens with floral aromas of passion fruit, ripe pear and walnut. The subtle palate delivers citrus, Golden Delicious apple and toasted walnut alongside brisk acidity and a fine mousse.",Italy-Lombardy-Sparkling Blend
"Somewhat rustic aromas recall soil, ripe black berries with a whiff of farmyard. The simple, straightforward palate delivers juicy black cherry and a hint of baking spices. Pair it with hearty pasta dishes or pizza.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Sassicaia has been showing amazing results in recent years, and the 2009 vintage opens with all the intensity and beauty you should expect of Italy's flagship super Tuscan. Notes of blackberry, soft spice, chocolate, espresso and a touch of rosemary oil make for a beautiful bouquet. The mouthfeel is long, supple and rich. Drink after 2020.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Wild berries, blueberries and some natural rubber come to the forefront of this bright, young Dolcetto. In the mouth, it offers cooling fruit flavors with a hint of firmness in the form of polished tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto
"This opens with aromas of sweet marzipan and bright forest berry, with subtle tones of ginger, cola and chopped herb filling in the background. It is tight and firmly astringent; drink after 2018.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"With alcohol at just 12.7%, this is one of several under-13% Pinots tasted recently that seem to be setting a new trend in Oregon. The elegance is welcome, and gives the flighty grape some room for nuance and even terroir. Light berry, watermelon, hints of earth and a fine balance make this an excellent quaffer.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Crisp and packed with lively lemon-like acidity, this wine shows both minerality and intense fruitiness. Textured and tight, it has hints of yellow fruit in the background that will blossom as the wine develops. Drink from 2021.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"The nose is fresh and pretty and there's definitely a luxurious texture to the flower-accented palate. However, it lacks intensity in the mouth and a slight funkiness on the finish detracts. Drink soon.",France-Provence-White Blend
"This savory wine opens with concentrated aromas of exotic fruit and green apples. The bright, juicy palate offers yellow peach, lemon zest and cantaloupe as well as crisp acidity. It closes on a note of bitter almond.",Italy-Lombardy-Turbiana
"This wine is three-quarters Grenache with the balance Syrah (15%) and Mourvèdre. Quite light aromas of raspberries, wood spice, herbs and spice are followed by strikingly pure, creamy-feeling red-fruit flavors that persist on the finish. One wants more aromatic generosity but the palate's appeal is hard to ignore.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Smooth and round from the start, with aromas of plum, cassis and cola. In the mouth, there's cherry and more cassis, and as a whole it's downright tasty. On the back side, the finish is firm and chocolaty, with good tannins. After tasting many a mediocre Pinot Noir from this Eugene-based winery, this flavorful if one-dimensional Cabernet is a revelation. Only 150 cases produced.",US-Oregon-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe luscious black-cherry and berry notes lend heft to this bold concentrated rosé. It's just a shade off dry, but balances neatly, juxtaposing crisp acidity against lavish texture and a pleasantly clingy finish.",US-New York-Rosé
"This is a lovely, unadorned Chardonnay: no oak, no malo, just great fruit. The beauty and power of the Dijon clones is on full display, with penetrating citrus and apple fruit buoyed by punchy acidity that carries through a long finish.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"This opens with subtle aromas of dark berry, tobacco and exotic spice. The vibrant palate is more expressive, delivering a core of juicy black cherry accented by notes of raspberry, white pepper, vanilla, licorice and savory herb. This finessed wine is still young, but structured with tightly knit, yet fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016–2025.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Ripe black cherry, rose petal, espresso, stewed fruit and a balsamic note lead the nose while the palate offers dried black cherry, ground pepper, anise and grilled sage alongside bracing tannins. A raisin note closes the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Delicate aromas recall white flower and citrus. The palate offers passion fruit, lime and white peach with a hint of mineral alongside bright acidity.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"Extracted and oaky, this will appeal to those who enjoy the popular style. It's strong in buttered toast and butterscotch flavors, with a pineapple jam note.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Planeta's fresh rosé (made with Syrah) shows attractive berry, citrus, herb and sweet almond-paste notes.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Syrah
"Clove-spiced pomegranate juice hits the nose first on this top-end bottling from the Foley family. It also offers some soy and sesame scents.

"Floral raspberry aromas carry a jammy scent. The palate on this Cabernet is grabby, with scouring tannins sitting in front of oaky berry and cassis flavors. On the finish, there's sweet blueberry, mint and pasty oak. This is good but oaky and a bit gummy.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Punset is a very interesting organic and biodynamic winery that tends to release its vintages much later than the others.

"A firm wine that is mainly tannin without a great fruit element. It is dry, tight and hard-edged.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"The Chester|Kidder Red gets an extra year in barrel and bottle prior to release. It's 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Syrah and 17% Petit Verdot, yielding a big bruiser of a red that is oaky and tannic, with black cherry and cassis under substantial flavors of char, smoke and toast.",US-Washington-Red Blend

"Dark, big, bold and extracted, this Syrah has tough tannins that are threaded with intricate flavors of blackberry, licorice, pepper, cola and grilled bacon.

"Fruit from this high-profile vineyard builds a velvety silky seductive wine that impresses immediately. It captures the ephemeral elegance of the grape, in a young wine with well-managed phenolics.

"Opens with true citrus, nettle and other snappy, prickly aromas. Like many Chilean SBs, it's fresh and charging, with zesty green-fruit and citrus flavors. Lime is present on the finish, as is a touch of lasting bitterness. Good but straightforward, and slightly narrow.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Basic plum, raspberry and leather aromas are good but not fancy or special. This is narrow and punchy on the palate, with hard tannins and pointy acidity. Roasted red-fruit flavors come with a woody accent, while the finish is oaky, dry and short on flavor. Drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Dark in color, with concentrated, jammy aromas of wild berry and plum. Offers a big body given that it's a $7 La Mancha varietal, with concentration, solid structure and full, mildly baked flavors of black fruits and baked fig. Short but stout on the finish.",Spain-Central Spain-Tempranillo

"Heavy char and cedar aromas sit atop green-leaning black-fruit scents. This is tight, juicy, acidic and woody on the palate, with shallow black-fruit flavors that are largely covered by charred oak. A zesty, toasted and tangy finish is full of life but falls short on complexity and depth.",Spain-Northern Spain-Graciano
"Give Prapò Barolo a few minutes to open in the glass. As it does, floral aromas evolve into tones of berry fruit, cola and smoked ham. The mouthfeel is compact, firm and crisp with a touch of menthol freshness at the end.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"This vibrant, linear wine opens with aromas of lemon-lime, pear and a whiff of alpine herb. The vertical palate offers crunchy apple, white grapefruit and a hint of mango alongside zesty acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Kerner
"Aged in large casks, this opens with aromas of toast, oak, and espresso. The palate offers fleeting Golden Delicous apple and citrus along with more persistent toasted oak sensations. Overall it lacks the fruit richness needed to support the evident wood influence.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega

"A modestly flavored Chard, marked by dryness and acidity that make the mouth water, with a touch of green apple and nectarine fruit. Really needs food to enrich it.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A brassy color and generous fruit flavors define this rich, dry and sophisticated bubbly. It has vivid cherry and white peach flavors, a smooth effervescence, crisp acidity and a lingering finish.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Reedy, herbaceous aromas suggest rhubarb and red licorice candy. This feels flat and lays heavily on the palate, while candied flavors of cherry and berry finish hot.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Winemaker Bill Owen (the ‘O' in O•S) has a knack for making white wines from red wine vineyards. This pungent, ripe, stylish Sauvignon Blanc/Sémillon blend is a fine example. The fruit flavors are thick and juicy— pineapple, golden apple, citrus—and the herbaceous nature of the grape has been transmuted into a sweet grassy streak, supported with mouth-searing acids. It's a roller-coaster ride, and delicious all along the way.",US-Washington-White Blend
"Structured and still remarkably young, this vibrant wine delivers aromas and flavors of ripe black cherry, cinnamon and licorice. It's balanced with bright acidity and youthfully austere tannins that need time to mellow out. Drink 2018–2033.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This robust wine impresses with its white pepper, leathery meat and bright blue fruit. Full powered, the oak is subtle and supportive and the tannins soft and unobtrusive.",US-California-Syrah
"This is a ripe, full-bodied wine, packed with black berries, sweet tannins and a generous acidity. The wine has weight along with an open character that is already appealing. Drink from 2015.",France-Provence-Rhône-style Red Blend
"In a vintage that yielded some attractive, supple wines, this wine stands out for its extraction and toughness. Chocolate, plum and clove notes are framed by firm tannins that come across gritty and hard on the finish.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"There is just a touch of peach amidst the green and yellow apple notes. The palate adds a stony earthy touch, as well as a hint of lanoline, and has an impressive core of fruit that radiates throughout this wine with pure apple flavor and crisp freshness. This strikes a high soprano note of absolute purity. The body is taut and bone-dry, the finish is clean and lasting. Gorgeous now but totally built to last. Drink now through 2035.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"This blended white wine from Sardinia opens with fragrant tones of soapy spring flower, honeysuckle and peach blossom. There are touches of caramel and butterscotch as well.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"Modest in alcohol, which is nice, but it comes at the price of richness. This is a lean, earthy wine whose acidity and tannins co-star with the cherries and tobacco. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"A dull Pinot, soft and not quite ripe. There's a vegetal aroma and taste to the raspberries and oak.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"With all the qualities needed for long cellar time—structure, freshness and fruit integrity—this already shows its considerable pedigree. It delivers tobacco, leather, black fruit and a touch of dried herb on the finish.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"Scratchy aromas of red fruits register as raw, with a note of animal hide. This feels racy and wild, but lively. Briny, rugged flavors of raspberry and plum finish tart, with a pickled note that won't let go.",Spain-Levante-Monastrell
"You'll find a rich vein of cherries, red currants and cedar, leading to a dry, spicy finish, but the velvety smoothness you want in a fine Merlot is what it lacks.",US-California-Merlot
"Pale copper colored, this wine is more focused on mineral than fruit expression, with aromas of wet stone out in front of citrus rind. The medium-bodied flavors dance lightly on the palate but still show concentration, texture and balance.",US-Washington-Rosé
"Inky-dark concentration segues to bold berry notes and loads of dark, deep fruit: plum, prune, blackberry and rum cake. There are also pretty dustings of dry mineral and dried herb at the back. This is a bold Brunello with power, determination, structure and balance. It needs at least 10 years of cellar aging.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"This wine is made from a field blend that includes 2% Viognier, the vines planted in 1991. Co-fermented, it offers a soft texture accented in vanilla bean, leather and dusty blackberry. Intense, it's balanced and not overripe, a nice take on the variety that flirts with tastes of orange and white pepper.",US-California-Syrah
"Minerally grapefruit, white peach, lettuce and scallion aromas are clean, inviting and textbook for Verdejo. A fresh, racy, cleansing palate holds grapefruit, orange and briny flavors. This is crisp as a whistle on the finish, but light on flavor and complexity. Drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"This is a fresh and forward effort that's based on all six Bordeaux grapes. It bears pretty plum and cherry flavors, with a chocolaty wash over the quick finish.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"One of the most compelling wines of its ilk, this big beauty has pure, focused and delicious fruit flavors, spicy and perfumed oak accents, and a very full body. The good mix of lively acidity and velvety tannins make it feel luxurious without smothering the taste buds.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Tight, crisp and mineral driven, this wine has citrus fruits and a steely texture, demonstrating that it needs to age for a year.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"With brooding aromas ranging from wild crushed berries to clove to wet clay, the palate features layers upon layers of flavor, and the wine coats the mouth like silk. Cherries, cola and other savory elements come with a slight tannic grip that ensures a few more years to enjoy this wine.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Melon aromas are a touch mealy and suggest cantaloupe that's past its peak. A foamy palate is coarse, while tastes of burnt orange and red plum. On the finish, this dissipates quickly.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Richly sweet, this is a wine that has traded primary fruitiness with deliciously balanced honey flavor and lively citrus acidity. It's a wine that has richness, intense flavor and the ability to age further.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
Here's a fresh and floral wine with an easy disposition and vibrant aromas of citrus and spring flowers. The body is light and lean—as informal Pinot Grigio should be—and the wine ends with a zesty blast of acidity. We like this vintage much more than 2006.,Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"There's not much intensity here but this simple Grigio works just fine for informal occasions. Aromas include honey, stone fruit and citrus and the wine offers a fresh, lean texture accented by zesty crispness.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Delicious and compelling 100% Cabernet from this great vintage. Shows classically developed, sweet Napa tannins and wonderfully ripe fruit. As expressive as the blackberries and currants are, they're reined in with minerals and herbs to produce exquisite tension. Best now, with a good decant, and should develop for many years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A ripe wine, with white fruits and a touch of spice. The crisp minerality of Vinho Verde is all there, with a satisfyingly textured aftertaste.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White
"This inviting Pinot is broadly ripe and fully lush in earthy, spicy layers, dark cherry and plum that plays across the palate. With a long, substantial finish, iot suits pork roasts and bacon-wrapped scallops.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Fruity in style, offering a bubbly mix of cherries, raspberries and blueberries in a medium-bodied format. It's softly dusty on the otherwise fresh finish.",Australia-Victoria-Shiraz
"Ripe, spicy and full both of ripe fruits and tannins, this is a full-bodied wine that brings out the minerality and structure of a Douro wine. It has plenty of red fruits to balance these tannins, resolving into the wine that is firm but ready to drink.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"From a vineyard on Rutherford's cooler, western bench comes this dry, spicy, firmly tannic young 100% Cabernet. It's aggressive and muscular now, with a hard, dusty astringency. But the rich core of red currants, black cherries, mocha, violets and cedar strongly suggests ageability. Better after 2011.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fruity frills of strawberry surround a core of black New Mexican chiles, with cinnamon and clove emerging the longer one sniffs. There's nice tension between the fruit flavors and the nearly bell pepper greenness. Throw a chill on it and serve with barbecued pork.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
This is a light and crisp Petit Chablis that is soft and totally ready to drink. Apricot and citrus flavors combine in a wine that is lightly mineral and very fruity. Drink now.,France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Something of both fresh and dried pink grapefruit zest plays about the nose. The very frothy palate adds some spice to that, as well as a pleasant hint of bitterness. All the fruit is accentuated by the frothing bursting bubbles. Drink soon, ideally as an animating apéritif. The zesty finish is very appetizing.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"A first for Lauren Ashton, this barrel-fermented Sémillon was sourced from the excellent Dineen Vineyard. It's firm and tightly packed with melon, jicama, pineapple and green banana fruit. Highlights of honeysuckle and lemon verbena are also in the mix. The finish is a little short, but more bottle age might well bump up the score.",US-Washington-Sémillon
"Sourced from the estate's Paderewski and Catapult vineyards, this blend of 32% Syrah, 25% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre, 10% Tempranillo and 8% Zinfandel bursts with blackberry, baking spice, violet and Concord grape aromas. Framed by firm but ready tannins, the palate shows blackberry, cola, white pepper and dried lavender flavors.",US-California-Red Blend
"Sure, cedar and chocolate are the dominant aromas and flavors, but there's enough blueberry fruit to stand up to the oak rather nicely. It doesn't hurt that the oak is high-quality stuff either, as the elements blend together in a harmonious whole. A little oaky, but shows a degree of finesse not often found in Chilean wines at this level.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Merlot
"This savory Rosso weaves together sensations of Morello cherry, wild strawberry and crushed raspberry lightly accented with notes of cinnamon and clove. It's round and ready to enjoy now with hearty Tuscan soups or mildly seasoned pecorino cheese.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"From the producer's estate vineyard, this savory, sultry wine is sublime in peppery, wild game. Its textures are alive and bright in acidity, with piquant black and red berry providing inviting juiciness. Made in small quantities, it's an incredible value for the quality, a wine that will sing on the table, and become more complex in the glass.",US-California-Syrah
"Viognier remains a strong suit for William Church, and part of the consistency is the vineyard sourcing each vintage from Conner Lee and Gamache, in roughly equal proportions. Lemon and lime, peaches and apricots rule the palate, ripe but neither hot nor bitter. There's a good long finish as well, but it's the fruit that really shines.",US-Washington-Viognier
"There is some solid structure here, along with a tannic edge that marks out a wine for aging. This has plum skin and a dense texture that brings out a richness as well as the acidity that marks the vintage. It should be aged; drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Yeasty aromas include briny notes of citrus and stone fruits, while on the palate, this is tangy and tight. Flavors of briny citrus, pickle and kimchee are zesty on a finish. This is not clean like polished crystal; funk and brine are key players on this Cava.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"This classic Chardonnay brims in lemon chiffon, stony minerality and luscious pear. The complex, soft, supple layers continue to surprise in the glass, teasing the palate with unexpected notes of nutmeg and Tahitian vanilla.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Full bodied and bold flavored, this is not overwhelmingly dark in color nor pumped up in ripeness. It does emphasize aromas of anise and dried plums, adding flavors of blackberrry juice and a sense of alcoholic strength. It is moderately tannic, while the texture is mouthfilling and the finish rather warm.",US-California-G-S-M
"Pol Roger's excursion into a bone-dry Champagne brings a house style with natural weight up against an almost bony wine style. The resulting mix is certainly dry, edgy, very crisp, leaning towards austere. Extra bottle time would help the wine to gain weight and flesh out the structure.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Stewy yet intriguing with a taste of clove that finishes bitter, this Petite Sirah needs a rich risotto to stand next to.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"This will now be a regular offering from Patit Creek. It has black cherry fruit, laced with iron filings and light streaks of tobacco and coffee. The high pH and low acidity adds some chalkiness to the finish, and suggests that this is best drunk up in the near term.",US-Washington-Tempranillo
"A Sauvignon Blanc-based blend, this opens with a pretty bouquet of white flowers before it becomes quite thick and rich on the palate.",US-California-White Blend
"Polished and balanced, this masterpiece shows restraint and it's already drinkable. With its great acidity and its fine intermingling of spice and red fruit flavors, this wine will appeal to lovers of Gamay and Pinot Noir.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This blend of Arinto and Chardonnay is crisp and fresh, showing the cool, ocean climate of the Lisboa region in its light, bright texture. It is juicy with peach and pineapple flavors cut by lime-juice acidity. Drink now.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese White
"This is made in a softer, sweeter style than most Pommery Champagnes. Strawberry flavors are ripe and integrated with the acidity, with a light tannic edge from the red wine in the blend. It is attractive and ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Toasty, tarry aromas include dark berry and baked plum notes. This offers ample tartaric acidity to cut the wine's weight, while flavors of berry, tea, mint and herbs lead to a good tasting but hollow feeling finish.",Chile-Maule Valley-Carmenère
This blend of organically grown Sangiovese (90%) and Colorino (10%) offers delicate violet and raspberry scents. The juicy palate delivers black cherry and chopped herb flavors with a hint of tobacco and chewy tannins. Drink through 2021.,Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Musky rose petal and potpourri aromas perfume this elegant, full-bodied Gewürztraminer. It's not intensely concentrated on the palate, but fresh peach and tangerine flavors are brisk, bright and enjoyable.",US-New York-Gewürztraminer
"Begins with muddled, murky, syrupy aromas of caramel and berries. The palate is more high-toned, with lemony accents to tomato, baked fruit and savory flavors. Finishes solid albeit lightly damp and bitter. Comes around with time but always seems a bit murky.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Light and frothy in the glass, this beautifully perfumed dry sparkling is redolent of orange blossoms, apples and pears. A blend of Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay, there's a delicious hint of buttery cashew nut and bitter almond amidst the floral, fresh apple and lemon flavors.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Fairly shy aromas of crushed grapes and grape seeds show on the nose of this widely available wine. It's also quite reserved on the palate, offering just a touch of plum, grape and earth elements.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
This vineyard-designate Brut sparkling wine opens with subtle tones of sweet grapefruit and lemon curd followed by softer touches of peach and honey. The creamy bubbling is followed by a touch of white pepper.,Italy-Veneto-Glera
"This historic and groundbreaking brand has been once again revamped and renewed. Among its latest hits is this simple, but persuasively food-friendly ripasso, which offers aromas of black cherry, cola, tobacco and spice, and a bright, firm mouthfeel.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Pithy citrus and an oily aromatic note give this white blend some funk on the nose. The palate is in good shape but typical in terms of feel and weight. Flavors of orange, papaya and mango finish with citrusy notes of lime as well as chalky minerality. This wine holds Parellada, Macabeo and Chardonnay.",Spain-Catalonia-White Blend
"There are not many village wines made in Vougeot with the large areas devoted to Premier and Grand Cru. This wine has reminiscences of the structure of those top wines although it is delicious in its fragrant strawberries, full and with just the right amount of acidity. The fruit comes from the Clos du Château. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Core aromas of plum flesh, chocolate and game are cut by a laser-like beam of balsamic, creating a sharp sensation. The mouthfeel is slender, lacking some meat on its tannic skeleton. It finishes on a slightly raisiny note.",US-Virginia-Red Blend
"Made from Roussanne and Grenache Blanc, this is an undeniably delicious, rather sweet white wine. This is so huge in orange, guava and nectarine flavors, but it's also a bit high in alcohol, which gives it a jalapeño-like heat.",US-California-Rhône-style White Blend
"Whiffs of turmeric and saffron lend exotic flair to this bracing lemon-lime Riesling. Off-dry in style, it's refreshing and quaffable, yet remarkably complex if you'll give it the time and attention it deserves. Drink now through 2020.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"This medium-bodied red includes 8% Merlot, 3% Petit Verdot and 3% Malbec. Toasted oak scents lead the nose, followed by generous cherry, cranberry and cassis notes on the palate, supported by soft acidity.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"High in acidity, restrained and focused on freshness above all else, this wine shines with wet stone, Meyer lemon and grapefruit peel flavors.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a delicious wine on all levels. Lazzarito opens in a bold, masculine style with overtones of ripe cherry fruit, leather and cured beef jerky. The wine then segues to soft, textured tannins with power and extra length on the close. It's impossible not to fall in love with a wine of this caliber.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This wine is half Merlot, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. High-toned aromas of baking spice, herb, dark chocolate and dark cherry are followed by luscious ripe red and black-fruit flavors. It's irresistible in its appeal.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This cuvée is made with the oldest block in this biodynamic vineyard. Planted in 1998, all Pommard clone, and given some extra bottle age, it's drinking well at the moment. Spicy cranberry-raspberry soda flavors come with a textural midpalate. There is a significant scent and flavor of tanned leather, which pleases some tasters more than others. That aside, the wine is complex, balanced and reasonably long.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Pressed rose, woodland berry, sage and a whiff of exotic spice emerge on this firmly structured wine. The taut palate delivers mature black cherry, ground pepper, clove and licorice alongside tight, fine-grained tannins and the warmth of alcohol. Give it a few more years to unwind. Drink after 2019.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Blending 90% Sauvignon Blanc with 10% Sémillon, this white is perfumed in jasmine and apricot honey. On the palate it becomes somewhat fleshier and less expressive, allowing for just a hint of peach.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon
"A rich, ripe and complex Cabernet, with classic Napa tannic structure. Not quite up there with the winery's higher-priced Dollarhide or Elu bottlings, but showing similar elegance and taste. Brims with blueberry, mocha and cedar flavors that should develop over the next four years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"An aromatic nose suggests fresh green pear, a touch of yeast and both citrus flesh and foliage: think lemon and lime. The palate has a stonger impression of yeast, giving an almost-salty texture, with a bright lemon streak of freshness. It's taut, dry, slender and refreshing.",Austria-Kremstal-Riesling
"Aromas of Granny Smith, stone fruit and citrus carry over to the palate along with nectarine, yellow peach and mineral. The palate is balanced by racy acidity and finishes on a bitter, nutty note.",Italy-Southern Italy-Greco
"This lightly oaked wine is full of fruit, ripe with red berries and crisp with acidity, just hinting at Douro minerality. That makes for a balanced fruity wine that with its soft tannins is ready to drink.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Kappa is a dark, brooding super Tuscan with a dense, inky color and syrupy aromas of overripe cherry, leather, mesquite, brown sugar and teriyaki sauce. It feels supple and incredibly rich on the finish and would make a great pairing for aged cheese.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"An orange pink color and orange blossom aromas give the wine a fine start. The palate follows through with some richly textured fruit, full of fresh acidity but softened away from total crispness. There is an attractive, full finish.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Complex tannins confound the palate at first, but mellow on the back side, inviting gregarious amounts of leather, black pepper and blackberry, a waft of cigar smoke in the mix, too. Fuller-bodied in style, the wine will benefit from time; cellar through 2020.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Soft and simple with sugary peach, citrus and vanilla flavors.",US-California-White Blend
"With a touch of oak, this friendly Chardonnay is a very nice wine for everyday drinking. It's dry and brisk, with pleasant apricot, tangerine and mineral flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Lip-smacking is an inelegant yet apt word to describe the unctuousness of this nectar of honey, saffron and marmalade. It's delightfully rich and creamy, yet gorgeously balanced, seared by a razor's edge of lemon-lime acidity. It's an exceptional wine now, penetrating and persistent, but will surely delight for decades to come.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Inviting aromas of violet and ripe red-skinned berry take center stage in this wine. The lively, full-bodied palate doles out juicy raspberry, red cherry and cinnamon flavors framed by velvety tannins and zesty acidity. Enjoy through 2020.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"Aged in a mixture of American and French oak (40% new), it's a palate stainer with notes of blue and purple fruit, chocolate and barrel accents. The rich fruit flavors pack a wallop along with firm tannins that lead to an oak spice filled finish. A big wine—not for the faint of heart.",US-Washington-Petite Sirah
"Wonderfully crisp in juicy acidity, which lends a balanced brightness to the spicy peach, pineapple, green apple, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors. This is a dry, Alsatian-style Gewürz from Anderson Valley, probably the best place in California to grow the variety.",US-California-Gewürztraminer
"This blend of 50% Merlot, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Malbec, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc shows cocoa dust, leather, beef jerky, dried blueberries and boysenberries on the nose. The palate is dense with tarry fruit notes, offering dark elderberries and smoked beef flavors.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A solid effort, this Shiraz-Viognier blend offers up raspberry and strawberry scents punctuated by more pungent notes of road tar, licorice, cola and black olive. It's full-bodied, powered by its 15% alcohol, yet could use a richer, thicker texture. Drink now to 2011.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz-Viognier
"Offers impenetrable blackness and thick aromatic layers of spice, blueberry muffin, blackberry preserves and a clear emphasis on wood-related notes of spice and toast. In the mouth, the wine delivers brilliant fruit flavors that last over a long finish and gritty, tight tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"Still young, this wine is firm and structured. It shows great concentration from the tannins and the rich blackberry fruits. With the acidity and the mineral texture, it is classic Douro, needing some more time. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"From a vineyard on the southern end of the Silverado Trail that's rich in iron and decomposed granite, this 100% varietal red is nicely crafted, displaying elegance and power in equal parts. Silky and inviting on the nose, it's exuberant and expansive on the palate, with cranberry and red currant fruit, the finish soft and intense.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Produced from Grand Cru vineyards on the Montagne de Reims, this wine is rich, dry and tightly structured. A mineral texture gives a steely edge that is balanced by perfumed fruit with apple and creamed pear flavors.",France-Champagne-Pinot Noir
"Opulent and ripe, this wine has fine tannins that support the rich red fruit and smoky acidity. The weight and concentration of the wine make it so attractive and indicate it will develop well. Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Straw yellow in color, this widely available wine offers vanilla, lemon curd, honeysuckle and a touch of browned butter on the nose. Once sipped, seared lemon and yellow apple show first, settling into a vanilla cream groove and finishing on a touch of marshmallow.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Light, but elegant and pretty, this wine spent 17 months in 40% new oak. Fruit flavors emphasize tart berry, with a dash of earthy sandalwood.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Not clear that Cab Franc deserves a bottling on its own, as it's better as a blending wine. That said, this is a pretty, polished red wine, full-bodied and dry in cherry, spice and oak flavors. Drink now and over the next five years.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"This wine displays peppery, spicy, briery fruit sweetness without discernible berry character. It's silky and plump on the palate, making it easy to drink in the near term.",Australia-South Australia-Grenache
"Dramatically reduced production coupled with a fine vintage add up to a stellar Snoqualmie Sauvignon Blanc in 2009. Loaded with melon, citrus and apple fruit flavors, this brisk and refreshing wine is reminiscent of a racy Quincy. Perfect springtime sipper.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a powerful, almost concentrated, very dry selection. Its richness comes from the weight of its fruit flavors and the tight tang of its intense acidity. From a fine vintage, it could still age for several more years. Disgorged July 2011.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Defines the Paso Robles style of enormously ripe fruit and softness. Incredibly rich in brown sugar, blackberry jam, chocolate and smoky oak flavors, it's not particularly subtle, but delicious now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Gritty, reedy, minty aromas overshadow this Tempranillo blend's hollow berry scents. Hard, tannic and drawn in, this wine tastes of rustic plum and berry fruits along with hard spices. Notes of tomato, green herbs and raw tannins create a rugged finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"Nothing small about this Pinot Noir. It's almost as good as the 2007, which was terrific. Dry and elegant, it shows massively concentrated cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with a rich coating of smoky sandalwood. Wonderful now, but the youthful power suggests time in the cellar through 2015 or so.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"There's plenty of ripe blackberry and cherry here, along with a heady dose of vanilla and spice, but also darker, earthier tones of forest floor and mulch that linger on the nose. The palate is fresh and crisp though, framed by fine, firm tannins and brisk acidity. It finishes with a tang.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc

"Dry herbal red-berry aromas are generic all the way. This feels a bit grabby and hard, while medicinal plum and raspberry flavors rank as herbal. Minty spicy flavors control the finish on this standard-issue Cabernet.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a crisp, tightly focused offering, but one that doesn't lack fruit. Scents of guava and gooseberry mark the nose, while the flavors are more like grapefruit and underripe pineapple. It shows admirable length for such an inexpensive wine.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Charcoal aromas shadow standard black fruit scents. This is forward in its approach, with a sturdy mouthfeel. Black plum and blackberry flavors feature a lot of vanilla and cream, while the finish is mild, straightforward and tastes mostly like oak and associated vanilla. Drink now through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This Rhône-style blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier is rich in honey, pineapple, peach and orange flavors. It has fine acidity and a steely core of minerals. Everything about it strongly suggests ham, bacon or sausages.",US-California-Rhône-style White Blend
"Muted aromatically, the wine is still generous in bright red fruit flavors, mostly strawberry-rhubarb and savory pomegranate, with accompanying layers of allspice. On the midpalate is the suggestion of vanilla before the finish delves into herbal, slightly sour territory.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"While the nose gives little away, the palate has a shy but very seductive nature: floral borders of honeysuckle adorn the edges of tart, fresh apple fruit and are highlighted by lemony acidity. The body is light and dry and shows playfulness and charm against a more serious, stony background. A very charming, subtle wine.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Black sage, wispy black cherry, dried violets, star anise and a woody character combine for a wondrous nose on this wine by regional pioneer Dan Lee. It's rich on the palate, with clove and nutmeg adding complexity to the plum, dried cherry and fennel bulb flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A nice, easy to like bubbly that shows why Korbel dominates the market at this price. It's dry and rich in citrus, vanilla, yeasty dough and charred, smoky flavors. Easy to find, with 20,000 cases produced.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Grapefruit, crushed tomato vine, exotic fruit and aromatic herb are some of the aromas you'll find on this fragrant white. The elegant medium-bodied palate delivers green melon, citrus and white peach alongside a vibrant saline note that energizes the finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon

"This full-bodied blend of grapes from a wide assortment of top vineyards shows fine acidity, a good phenolic frame of citrus rind, and core flavors of lemon and grapefruit, green apple and white peach. There's a seam of butterscotch also, from aging in one-third new French Burgundian oak barrels.",US-Washington-Chardonnay

"A voluptuous blockbuster in the style we are becoming accustomed to from über-consultant Michel Rolland: big, deeply fruited (black cherries) and plush, with elegantly etched spice shadings from new oak. The tannins are supple but substantial; it should age for a long time. Made entirely from old-vine Malbec and named after the pigeon coop in the Château's courtyard.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"This wine has deeply concentrated yet focused and spicy purple-fruit tones. It's generously endowed with notes of tobacco, licorice, mineral and pepper. The highlights keep piling on through a finish that seems to run for several minutes. This bold wine is enjoyable now but should also cellar well through 2020.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Gritty aromas of asphalt and black olive complement saucy berry notes. This feels full, rubbery and tannic, while the flavors are soupy and baked, with herbal elements folded in. On a long finish, herbal flavors of fennel and licorice are front and center.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is rich and surprisingly warm for the normally cool appellation of Pernand Vergelesses. It makes for an attractive, ripe and creamy wine that's been given a wood aging. But it doesn't have a sense of place.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"Intensely oak-driven on the nose, toasted coconut and coffee aromas are front and center. Rich, full and round in feel, with solid tannic structure, the palate initially follows suit, however upon further investigation a concentrated core of blackberry and dark plum lies underneath. The fruit is there, yet hidden by a heavy film of makeup.",US-Virginia-Petit Verdot
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec offers classic peppercorn and big juicy cassis and blackberry notes. It's enjoyable now in its vibrant fruit forwardness but also structured enough to let sit 2018–2020. On the finish are touches of bittersweet chocolate and dried herb.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Here's a pungent and intense Italian sparkler (made with Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco and Pinot Nero) that opens with bright aromas of apricot, mature melon, white almond and yellow rose. The wine is smooth and silky, and there's a ripe, warm quality to the fruit flavors.",Italy-Lombardy-Sparkling Blend

"The high alcohol may be a stumbling block for some palates, but this wine is nonetheless absolutely delicious. Sourced from a vineyard planted in 1972, it was aged in 50% new French oak. It's intense and detailed, with hints of wintergreen, a broad streak of cherry cola, and finishing licks of molasses, brown sugar and coffee.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This wine is dull and diluted in nebulous black fruit and a medium-sized body, with plenty of supportive tannins. The finish is quick.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"A fruity, fragrant wine, it has a light structure, soft tannins and generous, juicy red berry fruits. The balanced touch of wood aging smoothes out some of the sharp corners. Drink this attractive wine from 2016.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"The 2012 Taste Red shares many of the spicy, chocolate and graham cracker undertones of the 2013 vintage, but it's a bit more forward and plump with black-fruit flavors. Round and rich in texture yet refreshingly light in body, it's an easygoing red blend with wide appeal. Drink now through 2021.",US-New York-Red Blend
"Heavy aromas of baked berry fruits and raisin suggest a bit of overripeness. On the palate, that take is confirmed by chunky weight offset by natural acidity.

Drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"This is a tight, dry, tannic wine, showing all the hallmarks of ageabiity. Winemaker Philippe Melka has done a good job of blending fruit from Yountville, Atlas Peak and St. Helena to produce a seamlessly integrated Cabernet. The mouthfeel is soft, yet with fierce tannins that frame superb blackberry, cocoa, herb, mineral and cedar flavors. This continues a string of successful Cabernets that have been modestly priced, by Napa standards. Hold until 2018, at the very least.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Union Wine Company, which now owns Amity, makes a number of good-value, well-structured Pinots. Add this one to the list.

"This intriguing mix of cedar and cassis, with meatier elements of black licorice, sings in the glass, remaining restrained and elegant despite a full-bodied ripeness and cradling of French oak. Priced below many wines of similar provenance and quality, it's age-worthy, too. Drink now through 2021.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Complexity and longevity are the name of the game here. This shows a restrained nose of melon, smoke, nuts and a little buttery oak. The palate is really where it's at, weaving those same flavors seamlessly together. With a chalky texture and a good lick of acidity, everything is in balance here, setting this wine up for plenty of years of life. Drink now–2025.",Australia-Western Australia-Chardonnay
"An intensely powerful combination of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah and Zinfandel, this was given more than two years mulling things over in French oak. A menthol streak runs through the otherwise blackberry and leathery, tannic layers of this wine, the finish a tad short.",US-California-Red Blend
"There's very juicy, jammy red berry fruit here and the round, even soft palate may lack a bit of structure, but this is a flavorful, very approachable wine.

There's good intensity here and some sweetness, although the mouthfeel is in no way heavy or thick.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"Rustic, earthy aromas lead to a wine that's dominated by dark tannins and bitter chocolate flavors. That leaves little room for the rich berry fruits that are struggling to come through. Allow time for this toughness and firm extraction to soften. Drink from 2016.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red

"The Stillwater Creek vineyard bottling of Novelty Hill Syrah shows a bit more concentration than its sibling in 2011, with whiffs of pepper, earth, soy and umami. There's a saline character as well, reflective of the mineral-rich soil, and a pleasant taste of toast in the tannins.",US-Washington-Syrah

"A totally aromatic, floral and rose-spiced nose makes for an unusually fragrant Grüner. The palate shows the same floral spiciness, edged with exotic lychee amidst peppery spice, sprightly lemon acid and Grüner's telltale phenolic edge. This packs in a whole lot of flavor. Make sure you savor every last nuance.",Austria-Burgenland-Grüner Veltliner
"A bright pinkish-orange color makes this light-bodied wine stand out from the beginning, Fresh watermelon and cherry flavors carry on the rounded palate, with a slight sweetness giving softness.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A dense wine, rich and smooth for a Nuits-St-Georges, full of ripe red fruits, dark cherries and acidity that almost gives the wine a fresh character. Behind this fruitiness is a more solid, dark structure of tannins that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"With its soft acidity, silky mouthfeel and very ripe raspberry, cherry, currant, mocha and pepper flavors that finish almost sweet, this is a classic Paso Robles Zinfandel. It's a little hot in alcohol, but not too much.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Although this Cab is very dry, it's a bit astringent, with hard, edgy tannins and blackberry fruit flavors that veer into raisins. At its best now, so drink up.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This winery has been working for years with Barbera, but it's a tough grape to perfect in California. This shows the variety's rustic side, with briary flavors of wild berries and thick tannins. It's also sweet on the finish, like a simple Port.",US-California-Barbera

"A whiff of sulfur blows off with swirling; but the tightly packed fruit is less willing to expose itself. Locked down for now, but showing striated layers of raspberry, cherry, licorice, earth, coffee and char. Complex and dense, this young wine should be cellared for at least five years.",US-Washington-Malbec
"A salty, briny, minerally quality is pronounced in this larger-scale wine that opens intensely sour before mellowing into green apple and quince notes. Medium in weight, body and impact, it finishes with a tartness that suggests the need for food.",US-California-Chardonnay

Blackberry sauce leads the palate, with espresso bitterness and strong acidity throughout. A powerful but beautiful Syrah.",US-California-Syrah
"All estate-grown fruit, with 12% Cabernet Sauvignon included in the blend. Nicely defined, with sharp-edged tannins set against tangy berry and cassis.

"This vineyard-designate wine shows dark and austere aromas of cassis, dried berry, leather, pipe tobacco, licorice, dried ginger and prune. From the elegant 2006 vintage, the wine shows nuanced elegance and a long, silky feel on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"A blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon and 32% Merlot, this offers aromas of high-toned red fruit, French-oak spice and herbs that lead to luxurious but still in-check dark-fruit flavors. Tart black-tea accents persist on the finish.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (87%), Merlot (10%) and Cabernet Franc, with the fruit coming from Weinbau, Champoux, Lady Hawk and Ciel du Cheval vineyards.

"Within a statement-sized bottle, this heavy, lush and aromatic Pinot Noir from a great vineyard could ignite debates about California Pinot styles.

"Despite the effects of a cool year, this wine is still enjoyable. Its cherry fruit is tinged with notes of root vegetables and beet greens, and while there's ample weight, the tannins are just a touch drying on the finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"From the starting gun, this is a raisiny, candied wine with complexity issues. The palate is tannic and not the least bit varied; basically it just sits there. Flavors of raisin and red licorice finish sweet, medicinal and with a note of green peppercorn. This is flavorful but blocky and strange.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Big and bold, this emphasizes flavor impact. Attractively deep in hue, it stays ruby-colored and fresh-looking at the rim. An oak influence shows in the vivid vanilla and light maple syrup aromas and carries over to the flavors that show a vein of ripe berry fruit, too. Full bodied and velvety in texture, it has ample tannins that help carry flavors to the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of raw oak, vanilla, balsamic vinegar and olive crowd out blackberry and cassis notes. This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend feels a bit reduced and choppy. Herbal berry and chocolate flavors finish dry due to hard, almost abrasive tannins.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Red Blend
"This is clean and brisk in lemony acidity, and it offers concentrated, complex flavors of honeyed pineapples, limes, oranges and mangoes. It's dry and finessed.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Raspberry and plum aromas are fresh with a hint of sharpness. This defines zesty and crisp; the acidity level is high, which is common for 2008s, but there's enough body and power to support red-berry and vanilla flavors. A cleansing, fresh finish closes things out.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This brings a lot of flavor to the table for its relatively modest price. Round and spicy, it leads with juicy strawberry, cherry and apple pie fruit flavors. Hints of cinnamon wind through the finish, and overall the impression is of a pretty, lively and slightly sweet wine without pretense.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"From husband-and-wife team in California redwood country, comes this interesting Syrah, sourced from dry-farmed estate vines. Smelling of cedar pine and red fruit, it's very savory, full of pepper and leather, dark coffee and espresso. Lay it down another year or so to tame its wild soul.",US-California-Syrah

"This is singer/songwriter John Legend's inaugural wine project in conjunction with Raymond Vineyards in the Napa Valley.

This is a wine of great presence.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fully ripe, estate-grown fruit, 100% varietal, starts it on solid ground. It's soft and plummy, with purple fruits in abundance, and brings flavors of light chocolate threaded through smooth tannins. Just a little more acidity would elevate it further. Drink soon and enjoy.",US-Washington-Merlot

"This is big, rich, thick wine, dripping with gooey cherry and chocolate flavors. Blended from equal parts Grenache and Syrah, it features some notable tannins, although it's voluptuous enough to drink now. Pair it with barbecue.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Compelling and sweet-smelling, Archimede offers pretty tones of spice, black cherry, molasses, espresso and cola. The ruby-colored wine is zippy and fresh with soft tannins and medium length in the mouth.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"When a rosé pushes past 14% alcohol, that's an indication of a pretty potent wine. Here's a fine example, showcasing ripe strawberry and peach fruit, with excellent concentration and mouth-filling flavors. Using all free-run juice, this is fresh and full-bodied.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This high-end wine has a tenacious hold of earthiness, that exhibits as tomato leaf and dried herb. Full-bodied and densely concentrated, its tannins are smooth and fine, while the texture leans gravelly. Black pepper and leather characteristics are hard to ignore.",US-California-Merlot
"Intense lemon-lime acidity contrasts luscious yellow cherry and peach flavors in this vibrant, penetrating Riesling. Semidry in style, it's fine and filigreed in texture yet powerful enough to maintain a strong, long finish.",US-New York-Riesling
"A light-colored, lemon-zesty, cool-vintage Chardonnay that's fruit forward but has great balance and finish, light on the tongue and easygoing all around. With stone fruit and a hint of vanilla, this affordable white should also be fairly easy to find (almost 4,000 cases made) and a successful pairing with a range of lighter salads and seafood dishes.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Shows lots of berry fruit, with touches of green olives, sweet herbs, cocoa, funky leather and cedar, wrapped into firm tannins. A funny wine. Good and rich, but struggles to achieve complex interest, especially at this price.",US-California-Red Blend

"Baking spice and smoky wood-grain aromas are classy but dominate fruit scents. This wine feels crisp and snappy, with hard tannins. Spicy, woody flavors match the nose and are backed by chocolate and berry fruit notes, carrying through to the spicy, oaky finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Heavy oak and marginal white-fruit scents make for a compromised nose. This feels chunky and resiny, with heavy flavors of clove and raw wood. Additional clove notes on the finish render this Chardonnay an underachiever.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"Dark in color, this wine offers reserved aromas of smoke, tobacco, red fruit, crème de cassis, flowers, exotic spice and funk. The palate is plush and forward but still light on its feet, showing energy and focus. Fruit and savory flavors persist on the finish, demonstrating exquisite balance.",US-Washington-Tempranillo
"A superdark color and effusive aromas of wood smoke, raisin and dried fig set the stage for extremely concentrated, ripe fruit on the palate and a thickly tannic texture.

"As this is tight and currently aloof, it lacks the generosity of the 2009 vintage, but it may prove to be more ageable. It has deep, earthy flavors of red currant, cola and balsam, and it could blossom into something even more complex after 2016.",US-California-Pinot Noir
This wine blends Merlot from Stagecoach and Antinori vineyards on Atlas Peak with Malbec from the Trefethens in Oak Knoll and Merlot and Syrah from Hudson Vineyards in Carneros.

"This is always one of Janzen's best bottlings, courtesy of one of the jewels in the Beckstoffer crown of vineyards. The 2010 is softly tannic and enormously rich, showing wave after wave of blackberry essence, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and anise notes, with a firm minerality. It's beautiful now, but try to keep your hands off it until at least 2018.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Dusty lemon-lime aromas are modest yet clean. This is a highly regular bubbly with a medium-level bead and yeasty, leesy flavors of melon and mild citrus fruits.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Concentrated citrus fruit sings on nose and palate. The body reveals a stony, mineral texture of exquisitely clean dryness. There is the slightest edge of pleasant bitterness, just like in dried lemon peel. Linear, concentrated with lots of citric backbone. Drink 2016–2025.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Blocky and tart, this shows little of the flower or delicate citrus notes that many Oregon Rieslings convey. The clean apple flavor makes it good for summer picnics.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"This five-grape blend is muscular and wide on the palate, with oaky berry flavors that are also tarry and toasty. Hard tannins and some chop on the finish suggest further aging would be beneficial. Drink this Cabernet-led blend that also includes Garnacha, Syrah, Merlot and Cab Franc through 2025.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"This ripe, soft wine has gentle tannins under the rich red-berry fruits, with an attractive smoky edge from the wood aging. Drink this fruity wine from 2019.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Starting out brooding, this wine opens with notes of mortared violets, purple fruit, herbs and plum. The dark fruit flavors are dense and full, putting a focus on the purity.",US-Washington-Syrah
"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of bluish-black fruit, exotic spice and a balsamic note. The firmly structured palate doles out blackberry, spiced blueberry, coffee and black pepper accompanied by assertive but fine-grained tannins.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"This structured wine opens with quintessential Sangiovese aromas of violet and black berries punctuated with whiffs of leather and balsamic herbs. The palate delivers a core of black cherry accented with mint, black pepper and licorice notes that add depth. The hint of prune on the finish reflects the warm, challenging vintage, but this is a delicious, well-balanced wine. Enjoy soon. Soilair Selections, Vineyard Road, WineCraft.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This basic, inexpensive Pinot has Syrah and Viognier blended, but overall the wine is fairly generic, with a streak of smokiness in the background.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of scorched earth, baked fruit, roasted coffee bean, leather and underbrush take shape in the glass. The warm palate reflects the heat of the vintage, delivering a core of dried berry accented with notes of licorice and lightly toasted oak. Assertive tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2020.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Made with a minimal-intervention mind-set, this marries classic French winemaking to tight, almost steely Willamette Valley fruit. It's a taut, tense wine, focused on raspberry/cherry fruit, with firm, chocolate-tinged tannins. Highlights of malted milk and tobacco sneak into the extended finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"While the attack of this dry wine is akin to biting into a perfectly ripened white peach, notes of salt and slate accumulate on the palate, lending a profound impression of minerality. The mouthfeel is rich and full bodied, yet high-toned acidity adds structure and a prolonged finish. It's drinking well now, but still quite taut and should open gorgeously through 2025.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Ripe plum and berry aromas come with spice notes before a supremely generous palate that's loud and flavorful in blackberry, cassis and black cherry fruit. On the finish, chocolate and oak influences roll in as the tannins subside. For power, flavor and clarity, this is a sure bet.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Hints of smoke and bramble linger from nose to finish, lending a savory complexity to this dry-style Riesling. It's spry and invigorating, juxtaposing tart pineapple and lemon flavors against a backdrop of pressed apple and pear. The finish extends long with an elegant mineral tinge.",US-New York-Riesling
"This bottling of the classic Italian variety hits the right notes, with cherry, rose and tar on the nose, along with hints of sandalwood and incense. It's smooth on the palate, with dried cherry flavor and touches of chocolate, dried mint and caramel on the finish. It's still young and the firm tannins ensure a long life. Drink 2018–2029.",US-California-Nebbiolo
"Fresh but not overly racy, with apple and pear aromas. There's ample snap and pop to the palate, but not a whole lot of body or specificity of flavors. That said, the tastes of lemon and green apple are clean albeit shallow, and the finish is more of the same. Drink now.",Chile-Central Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This full-bodied, dry and quite tannic wine follows the classic form of California Cabernet Sauvignon, which forms 65% of the blend. The aroma is full of ripe black fruit shaded by nutmeg, cedar and cinnamon, while black currant and dark chocolate drive the concentrated and deeply rooted flavors. Best after 2020.",US-California-Red Blend
"This is a rich impressively structured wine. It showcases the Alvarinho and brings out its fruit and flavors. The subtle wood aging has just enhanced the fruit. The wine is delicious and is now just ready to drink, although it will be better from early 2018.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Alvarinho
"A distinctive mineral vein runs through this crisp white wine from the Cusumano brothers of Sicily. Made in Alcamo, in the southwest part of the Mediterranean island, the wine is fresh, easygoing and offers a touch of piquant spice on the close.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"A hazelnut-infused dessert wine based upon Pinot Noir, it's raisined, slightly volatile and impressively nutty. It turns creamy in the mouth, with rich flavors of hazelnut, toffee plus a hint of dried leaves.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Smoky in toasted oak, this textured, layered wine has a full body and considerable length, highlighted by chocolate mocha and black cherry.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A sweet, medium-bodied style of Pinot Gris, with honeyed flavors of apple, pear and pineapple. Despite the sweetness, the finish is nicely balanced, with a lush texture. Even prettier is the wine's pale copper hue.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Gris
"Following in the footsteps of this estate's successful Rosso di Montalcino (from the same vintage), this Brunello opens with soft tones of cherry and chocolate with slightly offbeat aromas of cookie dough or almond paste. The mouthfeel is vibrant and fresh.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"An okay wine that's light in color and aromatics, traceable in part to its cooler-climate heritage (95% of the grapes were grown in Mendocino, the rest in Sonoma, Monterey and Santa Barbara), which does give it some subtly pleasing red fruit and spice notes. But 2008 was also for much of Mendocino a vintage from hell and this wine may in truth be reflecting that year's challenges.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Nice and dry, with a good bite of firm tannins, but it's a little flat in the flavor profile. Shows decent cherry, berry, herb and cedar flavors that could be more vibrant and complex. But it is elegantly structured.",US-California-Merlot
"This blends intensity and nutty richness on the nose, backed up by a full, balanced palate. Flavors of dark caramel, toffee and chocolate end with the distinct flavor of café mocha and a lasting streak of caramel.",Spain-Andalucia-Sherry
"This balanced, ripe and fruity wine is already refreshing and crisp. Plenty of red-currant flavors go along with the lively acidity and bright aftertaste.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"An extraordinary wine. It's the essence of Russian River Pinot, squared, a big, concentrated, dramatic wine that never loses sight of elegance. Offers a tapestry of cherry pie with the crust, red currant, cherry liqueur and smoky sandalwood flavors that finish with intricate Indian spices. Drink now–2013.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"While initially a bit earthy and savory on the nose, this ethereal kabinett abounds in fruity, floral complexities. Cutting and spry, its sweet, tangy citrus and stone-fruit flavors seem to dance nervously on the palate. It's nuanced and minerally, with a deliciously salty finish.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Intense and focused, this good value Coonawarra opens with notes of leather and polished wood overlaid with red-berry fruit. Tannins are smooth, but there's plenty of lip-smacking acidity to keep the cherry cordial and plum fruit flavors lively. Drink now. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Hay, mint and grass add a green touch to the nose, which also features nectarine. Citrus, but nothing really defined, dominates the flavor profile. More citrus and zippy acids run wild on the finish. It doesn't offer any one thing for you to hang your hat on.",New Zealand-Martinborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"A sinewy wine that begins with ginger, lemon curd and white peach that give way to a slightly watery palate with a silky texture and good acidity to balance the substantial residual sugar. The short-to-medium finish ends on a candied ginger note. Drink now.",US-New York-Riesling
"The pineapple, orange and vanilla flavors seem a bit thin. But it's nicely dry, with a clean burst of acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Lime, apple and iodine aromas are the opening act for a low-acid, powdery palate with mealy green-fruit flavors. Briny notes of pickled cucumber and lettuce drive the finish alongside lemon-lime notes.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Smoky, rubbery, heavily oaked aromas sit on top of a stocky, creamy palate. This blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah is plump and candied, with hickory, bacon and generic black-fruit flavors resting on lemony acidity.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Cool vintages make Hanna's Sauvignon Blanc a little green and minty, and 2012 was another cool vintage. The wine is dry and low in alcohol, with a grassy, gooseberry taste.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"A trim, redcurrant fruited light red that is very refreshing: this might even take to being chilled. Red-currant flavors are uppermost, the tannins are soft, light and ready. Drink this now while it's fresh and fruity.",Austria-Burgenland-Pinot Noir
"Mouthcoating, this is a full-bodied wine with small amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Tar, leather, cedar and black cherry stand out as characteristics, with added weight from the heavier, darker elements of chocolate and oak. Drink now through 2022.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The label is somewhat confusing (though attractive) as it has taken the appellation name Aix as its own. Rich and full of spicy red fruit, the wine is balanced with crisp acidity. The blend is Grenache (60%), Syrah (20%) and Cinsault (20%). A definite dry character puts it on the dining table.",France-Provence-Rosé
"The oldest Chardonnay vines in the Willamette Valley, planted in 1965, create a spicy, textural, refined wine with tremendous length and detail. All the wine was aged in neutral wood, which shines a light on the beautiful fruit, with green apple, almonds, and hints of butter and vanilla.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Very delicious and luscious, but no mere fruit bomb. It has the tannic-acidic structure and dryness to make it refined, but explodes on the palate with blackberry, chocolate, cassis, anise and sweet, smoky cedar flavors that are deep and long. Tastes important and first rate.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Scattered, dusty, yeasty aromas of mustard and apple are less than welcoming. This feels choppy and strained, with vanilla and white-fruit flavors.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Here's a young, hedonistic Pinot that captures the essence of RRV from a perfect vintage. Although it's ripely forward in cherry, pomegranate, Dr. Pepper, red licorice and cinnamon spice flavors, it shows a structural sophistication that elevates the score. Beautiful now, and should improve over the next 6 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Soft and rich, with loads of ripe fruit flavors, this Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah--Merlot blend offers a crisp dash of freshness that keeps the palate clean. It's a balanced wine, with a sophisticated twist of spice and dark fruit on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"Grenache makes up nearly three-quarters of this blend, with the rest Syrah and Mourvèdre. Bright raspberry, cranberry, rose hip and white pepper aromas lead to elegant yet high octane fruit flavors that taper toward the warm finish.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"The aroma of charred oak dominates this Malbec, while oak tannins rule the palate. The underyling wine is soft and fruity and tannic in itself, with blackberry and currant flavors. Big and hefty, it's a wine to drink with superrich fare, like barbecue or meat stews.",US-California-Malbec
"This shows wonderfully layered, complex flavors, in addition to great structure. Thoroughly dry, with rich, fine tannins, it flatters with red and black currant, red cherry, milk chocolate, licorice, root beer, vanilla, dusty spice and smoky oak flavors. Luscious now and through 2010.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"With feline aromas of juniper bush, grass and sweaty citrus, this is true Sauvignon Blanc. Oak aging has lent an easiness to the mouthfeel, which shows good acidity. Flavors of green fruits, melon and pithy bitterness end in chalky clarity. This is one of Argentina's best Sauvignon Blancs.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Sauvignon Blanc
"Grapeseed, cola, concentrated plum, graphite and a touch of tar funk show on the nose of this bottling. There is a tangy raspberry-plum fruit character on the palate, with shaved pencil elements and decently grippy tannins.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A bit of bottle age has made this vintage quite fascinating, with cola, black tea, black plum and mulberry on this wine's deep and peppery nose. The flavor profile is hearty with star anise and dried spearmint as well as deeper dried red-fruit touches. The texture is mild but the overall experience is complete.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Fresh and jammy in raspberries, cherries and blackberries, this wine trades complexity for sheer fruity power and lusciousness. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Pungent up front, with green herb, white pepper and citrus aromas, this is zesty and acidic on the palate, with a monotonous lemon flavor on the finish. It turns more tart and acidic as it airs.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a perfect example of why Moscato is so popular. What's not to like, with the crisp, clean mouthfeel and seemingly sweet flavors of honey, orange and vanilla? So zesty, it's impossible not to drink a few glasses, and the alcohol is refreshingly low.",US-California-Moscato
"This exquisitely crafted model of balance offers lemon-bar meringue and baked pear on the nose before revealing a tightrope of minerality and lush concentration on the palate, weighted perfectly against each other. Fleshy and delicious, the wine has so much fine fruit to offer now it'd be shame to wait, yet it will clearly hold onto its beauty with age.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This easy blend of Friulano (60%) and Malvasia opens with subtle tones of exotic fruit and peach followed by bright citrus and tangerine skin. The wine's lean, watery finish makes it perfect for appetizers or finger foods.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend
"Slightly sweet and powdery smelling, with simple creaminess to the orange-influenced nose. The palate is solid and plump, with basic citrus flavors that shouldn't steer you wrong. Nice feel and a good but regular finish seal the deal.",Chile-Curicó Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Black olive, slate, black peppercorns, thick-skinned elderberry, charcoal and mocha hide a deep-seated pyrazine aroma on the nose of this bottling. That green-peppercorn flavor also shows on the sip, along with charred plum.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lots of oak on this wine, which shows rich vanilla custard, buttered toast and caramel flavors. However, the underlying fruit isn't able to support it. There's some pineapple and nectarine, but the wine ultimately collapses under all the wood.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Aromas of white peach, flint and hint of banana carry over to the round, ripe palate along with green apple and a note of juicy tangerine. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors and leads to a bright, clean finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"A tight, crisp wine from vineyards that face across the river to the town of Chablis. The wine has delicious yellow fruits, intense acidity and an opulent character. The vines of the vineyard face east giving warmth while keeping a strong mineral texture. Drink this wine from 2019.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Though it seems to have some of the lightness of young vines in the cherry fruit flavor, there is clear Red Mountain terroir in the mouthfeel. Tight, dark, supple and almost steely, this layers its fruit atop a mineral base, and finishes with a whiff of smoke and pickle barrel.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This easygoing wine offers aromas of red and dark-skinned berry and a whiff of moist soil. The soft, round palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry and notes of baking spice alongside fresh acidity and silky, smooth tannins. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Tasted just after bottling, the wine was a little bottle-shocked, but should be fine by Summer 2010. Rich and creamy, with complex tropical fruit, buttered toast, lemondrop candy and honeysuckle flavors. An amazing 111,000 cases were produced.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Coombsville has emerged as the hottest appellation in Napa Valley, and Cameron Hughes is right there, doing his negociant thing. The Cabernet was blended with Malbec and Merlot, and the wine is fantastically satisfying. Its rich, sturdy tannins frame elaborate blackberry, blueberry, red currant and smoky oak flavors that are wonderfully complex, with an elegant, balanced finish. This is an unbelievable price for a Cabernet of this high quality.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This beautiful wine opens with aromas of ripe dark berry, scorched earth, mint, menthol and a balsamic note. The vibrant palate boasts juicy red cherry, black raspberry, sweet pipe tobacco, baking spice, grilled herb and a hint of game. It's still young and nervous, with tightly wound but refined tannins and firm acidity. Give it time to fully develop. Drink 2020–2031.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Scents of perfumed dark berry, rose, cake spice and aromatic herb unfold on this structured red.

"Full bodied, softly tannic and immediately appealing, this offering from Alain Jaume's négociant business is attractively priced. It's not the biggest or most complex Châteauneuf-du-Pape, but the ripe black-cherry and chocolate flavors and finely dusty texture are undeniably satisfying. Drink now–2018.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"The cherry marmalade, red currant, mocha, caramel and white pepper flavors are so delicious, you might be drinking a candy bar, with very high alcohol giving it a heady warmth. It's an impressive Grenache, thick and liqueury, for drinking now.",US-California-Grenache
"The nose isn't very expressive but eventually yields subdued whiffs of toasted oak and honey. On the shy palate, suggestions of mature apple, lemon drop and a briny note come through before a rather abrupt finish.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"The warm 2015 vintage has softened and rounded this 100% Sauvignon Blanc wine. That gives the wine ripe fruits, touches of pineapple as well as white peach. With attractive acidity at the end, the wine is still crisp and young. Drink now.",France-Southwest France-Sauvignon Blanc
"Enticing white pepper mingles with ripe, red plums creating a savory, light bodied red, soft in tannins that are very moreish. Its lightness enlivens while new fragrant facets of cherry fruit are revealed over time. Not an obvious wine, but clearly full of charm.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Zweigelt
"A simple, everyday wine. Tastes grapey and jammy, with blackberries, cherries and raspberries that are distinctly sweet.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This Mourvèdre has a pretty cherry flavor, with a suggestion of ripeness that borders on raisining. It also carries interesting details of dried leaf and milk chocolate.",US-Washington-Mourvèdre
This wine has a firm tannic structure and fresh acidity but the fruit is drying up fast. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol.,Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Varietal aromas of tomato vine, elderflower, gooseberry and citrus lead the nose and follow through to the palate along with grapefruit, sage and mineral. Racy acidity leaves a crisp finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon

"Named after the lords of Hattstatt—a word that evolved to Hatschbourg—this wine comes from selected grapes. It's a medium sweet, rich wine with a smooth structure and opulent texture. Lychees and yellow fruits are cut with lime acidity to balance ripeness and freshness. It's a wine to age, drink from 2018.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris

"This clipped, sharp wine leads with berry and plum scents. In the mouth, it's all acid and no fruit, tasting extremely sour.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This pure Merlot is made from fruit that was sourced from Bacchus, Conner Lee, Dionysus and Klipsun vineyards. Sappy, spicy and loaded with black fruits, this delivers plenty of flavor across the rich midpalate. Notes of black cherries, coffee grounds, licorice and smoke all come into play.",US-Washington-Merlot
"A superb wine from a great year, this is powerful and structured, with great acidity and solid, pronounced fruits. La Romanée is a small vineyard, wholly owned by Liger-Belair, next to Romanée-Conti. The wine is rich, spicy and very complex, with black fruits welling up from its depth. With great structure, it brings together opulent Pinot Noir fruits with firm, dense tannins with immense aging potential.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Enormously sweet and soft, with glycerine, brown sugar, black cherry, white chocolate, vanilla bean and white pepper flavors, this is one of the more eccentric, heady dessert wines out there. The alcohol is ridiculously high, yet the Madeira-like sweetness balances it.",US-California-Red Blend
"Pretty floral aromas with whiffs of red berry and savory herb take shape in the glass. Flinty mineral, pink grapefruit and a hint of baking spice back up the red cherry core.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"The good 2006 vintage has produced this well-balanced wine that is now showing delicious signs of maturity. The initial fruit has gone, replaced by toast, spice and grilled almonds. At the same time, the acidity and taut mineral texture are still in play, giving a wine that is lively and just ready to drink now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"A whiff of lanolin is a harbinger of maturity adding depth and complexity to this penetrating, fruity wine.

Delicious now, but sure to develop well through at least 2025.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Fresh and fruity, this wine is also lightly herbal and shows touches of wood. It is crisp, tangy with its yellow-fruit flavors mingling with the citrus acidity. The wine will be ready to drink from late 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Compared to Artesa's three other 2009 Pinot Noirs, this one's the least drinkable at this time. Although it's very extracted in cherry and raspberry fruit, it's jammy-simple, like a spoonful of marmalade, with a scour of acidity. Your best bet is to cellar it for 4–6 years and see what happens, but odds are you won't be disappointed.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Made by the same team as Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande, this wine is ripe, full and satisfying. It has smooth red berry fruits that are sustained by subtle wood aging and given a final lift by the acidity. For medium-term aging, so drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

Characteristics of charcuterie and spicy apple pie combine in a complex tension of savory and richly layered concentration, leaving a memorable impression as it traffics in nutmeg on the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a gorgeous wine on many fronts. Firstly, its aromas of wild berry, smoke and cedar are focused and pristine. Secondly, the texture it imparts in the mouth is dense, firm but ultimately yielding and plush. Lastly, the wine's fresh flavors endure for many minutes.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"Tastes of perfectly ripened pineapple, pear, lime and peach flavors. On the structural side is fine acidity and a tangy minerality, like a lick of cold steel. Oak is here, notable but perfectly integrated. Give this Chard a little time in the glass to breathe.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A majority varietal, with 10% Roussanne blended in, the whole is then aged in stainless steel. This white is fuller-figured than many, with big, bold flavors of fig and vanilla. It finishes crisply with just the slightest accent of anise.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

A soupy stewy palate tastes of baked berry fruits, prune and chocolate. Consistent with the rest of the wine, this finishes soft. Drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"This Bordeaux blend features charred, barrel-driven aromas along with leather and black-fruit aromas. The palate is snappy and acidic, with plum and raspberry flavors poking through a heavy coating of concrete tannins.

"This somewhat flat, green and tannic wine is reduced and sour in tone, with medium body and broad acidity.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This is the densest, most tannic of Pride's new releases, obviously meant for the cellar. You could drink it now, because it's so lush, but the tightness suggests that the winemaker doesn't want you to. Buried under the astringency are masses of cassis, dark chocolate, sweet fresh herbs and smoky oak. Better after 2010.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Floral and fruity, with clean aromas. In the mouth, it's saturated and intense as if offers up a meaty set of dense fruit flavors. Doesn't show as much complexity, layering and variety as we might like to see, but it's pretty flashy and good for a 2007, a vintage that was problematic in this region.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Here is a distinctive “super Calabrian” blend of Gaglioppo and Cabernet Sauvignon that delivers black olive and capers beyond subtle notes of blackberry and cherry. It has sharp, crisp dimension in the mouth with good structure and should be paired with a cream-  or butter-based dish for balance.",Italy-Southern Italy-Red Blend
"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up over 70% of this blend with the balance Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec. It shows aromas of dark cherries, licorice and brooding black fruit that at times seems slightly dried out. The palate shows elegantly styled dark-fruit flavors that linger on the finish.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

Just the right touch of earth, herb and licorice to give it added interest through the finish.",US-Washington-Malbec

The spine is of lemony acidity, painting a picture of thrilling, concentrated freshness, interspersed with peppery layers of interest and a nearly endless herbal finish.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"Mainly Grenache and Syrah, co-fermented with Viognier. It's a massively rich, dense wine, erupting in raspberry and cherry pie filling, cassis, blackberry liqueur, sandalwood and spice flavors. A real crowd pleaser, forward and dramatic, if a bit high in alcohol. A great steak wine.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Toasty oak is wrapped around some complex elements: blackberry, violets, tar, cedar, coffee and game. Big, very dark fruit, tobacco and toast flavors soar, and the mouthfeel is intense yet not weighty. Fine structure on the finish, with black-currant fruit and tar, coffee and cocoa accents.

From four different parcels in premier cru, this seductive wine will also age well. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Sharp and a bit volatile, this young Viognier tilts strongly to the orange side of citrus. Despite the fresh fruit flavors it feels a bit flat in the mouth, lacking vitality.",US-Oregon-Viognier
"Young and precise, this balances flavors of wild raspberries against a mineral foundation. Suggestions of wet stone and a dash of brown spices come through, with lots of supporting acidity. As it fades, there's a lick of chocolate from aging in 29% new French oak.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This ripe, juicy wine offers blackberry flavors and young acidity. It is developing balance, fresh fruits and supporting tannins.

"Rusty and translucent in color, this smells downright grassy and green, with tobacco and leafy notes as prominent as dried cherry scents.

Given 2009's overall warmth, this green, underripe reserva is surprisingly difficult.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend

"Gianfranco Bovio represents 20 hectares of vines planted to Nebbiolo, Dolcetto and Barbera. The Arborina cru has clay soils and its wines are, as a result, slightly more concentrated and darker in color. Aromas here recall blackberry, black licorice and cherry cola.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Elegant, aromatic, and expressive in the nose, this blossoms into a pleasing mix of berries, cherries, bark, spice and sassafras. Good acidity, with a lick of chocolate in the tannins and the finish. Though very light for Syrah, this has good balance and length.",US-Washington-Syrah
"A ripe style—possibly too ripe for some—this borders on cherry-chocolate liqueur. The tannins are meltingly soft, the weight is ample and the texture is plush. Drink it by 2020 for its hedonistic charm.",New Zealand-Central Otago-Pinot Noir
"While the nose is quite neutral, the palate of this off-dry Riesling boasts ripe, concentrated peach and apricot flavors bolstered by sunny lemon acidity. Juicy and mouthwatering, it's a lively sip to be enjoyed young.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"This ripe, deliciously fruity wine has red plum and black currant fruits along with fragrant acidity and a gently tannic structure. It will be ready to drink from 2017.

Baking spice and dried cherry and cranberry aromas lead to lighter-styled fruit flavors with a gentle grip of tannins. It trails on the finish.,US-Washington-Merlot

"This wine is all about fresh fruit and refreshing acidity. Crisp citrus, green apples and a touch of apricot give a fruitiness contained with a steel and mineral texture. It is full of acidity while keeping a riper, fruity character. Drink from late 2015.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Despite being nine years old, this comes across young and jammy, with foxy aromas of wild berries and animal fur. The palate is blocky, heavily extracted and fully ripe in feel. Flavors of prune and blackberry finish with hard tannins. Drink or hold.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"The vineyards of the 13th century abbey of La Ferté produces some of the best Givry. This wine has great structure with firm tannins, and also rich, juicy fruitiness that offers delicious acidity and a more solid base for aging. Drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"The lightest of the 2012 single-vineyard Pinot Noirs from Giant Steps, this is an almost delicate wine with silky tannins. Notes of smoke, earth and mushroom mark the nose, while hints of pine boughs impart a slightly medicinal edge to the cherry fruit. Drink now.",Australia-Victoria-Pinot Noir
"Aged 30 months in large oak casks, Amarone Podere Cariano is a sweet, sticky wine with maple syrup and honey backed by Indian spice and waxy aromas of antique furniture. The intensity and darkness are impressive, but ultimately this wine would pair best with sharply aged cheese.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Leather, roasted berry and barnyard make for a rustic, warm nose. The palate is grippy, with chewy, roasted black fruit flavors. Meaty, lasting, deep and dense, but also rubbery and a little low on acidic vitality. A Monastrell-Tempranillo blend to drink now.",Spain-Central Spain-Red Blend
"Ripe while also herbal, this is an easy fruity wine. It has an attractive spice and perfumed white-fruit character that enhances the crisp citrus fruit. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Poggio Antico is one of the best estates in Montalcino but the 2008 vintage doesn't reach the impressive heights of 2006 or 2007 that showed much fuller and more generous results. This edition offers plum, wild berry and leather aromas with a lean mouthfeel and sharp acidity that will soften with a few more years of bottle aging.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso

"This winery is at the extreme edge of the pick-early, low-alcohol movement, which can make the wines challenging for the usual California Pinot fan. But this Pinot begins on familar territory, with heady aromas of dried violet and scarlet rose, damp forest floor, and cinnamon-laced cranberry sauce, managing to be both brisk and funky. The flavors are light and tart, but will pick up more savory characteristics from 2018–2024.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a celebratory taste of blueberry pie that's silky smooth and additionally complex in vanilla, leather and dark chocolate. Luxuriously soft, it finds a way to mellow its tannins without sacrificing power or concentration.",US-California-Malbec
"This full-bodied and effusive wine has a sweet, oaky aroma and similarly rich flavors of black cherry and blackberry jam. It feels smooth and luxurious.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A deliciously priced blend of 60% Mourvèdre, 13% Syrah and 27% Grenache that'll be tricky to ask for by name but is worth the effort to find and share. This blend shows off brooding dark dollops of spicy fruit, herb and tobacco that are tenaciously balanced by the cherry tones from the Grenache. A fun wine to pass around at parties and barbecues.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"The Ceretto was surprisingly evolved for a 2006. A big, ripe, rich wine with flavors of pear, lychee and a hint of lime peel. Structurally, this is a wine that probably won't hold up well, but at the moment it is a pleasant wine. Just make sure you drink it over the next few months.",Italy-Piedmont-Arneis
"This beauty is rich in raspberry and blackberry leaf aromas on the nose, which carry through to the palate and are joined by flavors of kirsch, clove, lavender and tobacco. Well integrated tannins and bright acidity lead to a long, smoky finish.",US-Virginia-Cabernet Franc
"There's a revitalizing swathe of herbs on the nose of this medium-sweet Riesling, highlighting notes of lemon and lime against a backdrop of juicy, ripe yellow peaches and nectarines. It's delicately lacy on the palate, yet bolstered by tones of honey and wax. A citrus acidity that pierces long on the finish.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"A deceptive Pinot. It shows a pale color and a very delicate, silky mouthfeel, but the impact on the palate can only be described as explosive, and the aftertaste is very rich. The flavors of cherries, cotton candy, red raspberries, orange tea, smoky vanilla, cinnamon, cloves and brown sugar are compelling. Best now and through 2010.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Smells and tastes too oaky, with buttered toast and vanilla notes smothering everything else. Somewhere down in there is a pretty nice Chardonnay, with good acidity and fine pineapple, pear and apple flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Gold in color, with aromas of turpentine and wood resin, this is entirely defined by barrel-based aromas, flavors and mouthfeel. Nothing but oak and related clove, resin and bitterness is making a mark.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay

"Touches of exotic spice and crushed minerals lend complexity to sun-kissed peach and melon flavors in this medium-sweet Riesling. It's punchy and spry, full of high-toned acidity and lift, but finishes long, lean and elegant. It's youthful and exuberant now, but should continue to meld beautifully through at least 2027.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"The packaging is totally crazy but the wine is more subdued. A blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet, it delivers raw strawberry, green leaf notes and loads of dried hay. It has a sharp, solid build and rigid tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"In the big, ripe and saturated school of winemaking, this wine has a deep color, oodles of black cherry and blackberry flavors and full body. It also has enough firm tannin and acidity to keep the structure lively and the finish fresh, so it's a lot of fun to drink and can take on all kinds of rich proteins at dinner.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Warm, earthy, jammy berry aromas are oaky and bring a note of latex into the fold. This chunky Malbec is tannic and grabby, with oaky flavors of black plum and vanilla set against herbal undertones. Spice, chocolate, carob and drawing tannins create a bold but rough finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A nose of pure lemon zest also has the faintest notions of juniper and bitter orange peel that seem to assert themselves more on the slender, sylph-like body of this incisive wine. That lemony purity illuminates the taut palate and highlights those spicy reaches that are merely hinted at. A subtle wine of immense charm.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"Simply sensational, this estate-grown Viognier raises the bar for everyone. It's a glorious mesh of citrus flesh and rind, elevated with spicy highlights of orange, tangerine and Meyer lemon. Outstanding concentration, focus and depth, with juicy acidity underlying an astonishing finish.",US-Washington-Viognier

"From an estate in the far west of the Cima Corgo region, close to Regua, this wine is structured and deliciously ripe in black fruits. It has a solid base of tannins that is allied to perfumed acidity and a hint of wood aging. Drink from 2017.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red

"Juicy streaks of grapefruit and pineapple in this spry, dry Riesling are cut by laser-focused acidity and rocky edges of slate. It's approachable and fresh yet abundantly elegant. Drink now through 2018.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"This dry white wine seems to be all about smooth texture and reserved flavors rather than overt fruitiness. It has a gold, Chardonnay-like color, mild aromas of almond and butter, a rather full body and a lingering but subtle honey-like finish.",US-California-Sémillon
"Aromas of graphite, asphalt, floral berry, black cherry and oak are harmonious and inviting. This wine feels juicy and rubbery, while black-fruit and plum flavors come with herbal notes and overt barrel notes. A fresh, juicy, zesty finish is pure Graciano.",Spain-Northern Spain-Graciano

"This opens with aromas that suggest orchard fruit and citrus. The zesty, straightforward palate offers white peach, nectarine and green apple alongside bright acidity.",Italy-Central Italy-Verdicchio
"Too sweet and oaky, with sugary vanilla and pineapple jam flavors. Could be a Starbucks drink. Saved a bit by crisp acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Smoked beef, tart cherries and dark berries show on the inviting nose of this hearty bottling from winemaker Paul Clifton. The palate is both heavy duty and elegant, with blackberry and black-cherry fruit resting on a spicy backbone of ginger, clove, bay leaf and aromatic chocolate, leaving the tongue singing for quite a while.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This interesting wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with a drop of Cabernet Sauvignon that seems to give it a bit of needed power. Still, it's soft and melted. While the currant, red stone fruit and licorice flavors are delicious and complex, it lacks structure. Drink up.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Floral and black fruit aromas are punctuated by spicy notes on the nose of this wine. The delicious palate delivers juicy black-cherry, white pepper, mint and sage along with big but ripe tannins and edgy acidity. Give it a few more years to fully develop.

"This coastal Chardonnay is ripe and forward in apricots, orange and mangoes, bright in acidity and strong in oaky flavors of buttered toast.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This older vintage Chardonnay has a flinty, saline quality to it and a faint taste of waxy apple. Medium in body, it's savory and surrounded by citrus tones with a high note of acidity. Clean and integrated it's a nice reminder of how Chardonnay can be just as fresh and alive five years on as upon first release.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Calling this big-boned brew potent may be understating things. This is brawny Tupungato Malbec in full armor. Early oak-driven aromas of hard cheese and char support muscular black fruit scents, while the palate is ripe and sweet as it offers blackberry and cassis flavors. Comfortable on the palate and well balanced overall.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec

"This Graciano-based rosé smells oily, a bit funky and like chewing gum, with no specific fruit scents. A high-acid palate reflects the high-acid base grape, while this tastes salty, tangy and pickled, with vague fruit flavors that turn briny on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Rosado
"Dry, streamlined and acidic, with suggestions of peaches, apples, vanilla, cream and cinnamon. A decent everyday Chardonnay with a touch of smoky oak.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This blend of 57% Syrah, 35% Grenache, 6% Mourvèdre and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon shows black plums, roasted figs, cinnamon stick, uncrushed clove and star anise on the nose. That great nose doesn't translate yet to the palate, which is sticky with dark plum skin tannins, and proves a bit too leathery for drinking right now. Wait awhile and this one might work better.",US-California-Red Blend
"Made by longtime Napa winemakers Bernard Portet and Bob Pepi, this Cab is a complex study of bittersweet chocolate, cedar and herb. Juicy, it features a well-managed use of oak and medium body and weight, finishing with a sense of elegance.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Cab-based Bordeaux blend is very dense in fruit and also very Tannic with a capital T. Such is the astringency that it may never go away before the blackberry and black currant fruit drops out. Nonetheless it's dry and savory and, in its own Rockpiley way, classic. Drink with superrich barbecue, well-marbled grilled beef and such. Tasted twice.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Ortman reaches into this Central Coast county to produce this slightly awkward wine. It's dry and rich in cherry pie filling, mocha and spice flavors, but has too much acidity, giving it a chile pepper burn.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Deliciously drinkable now, with very dry but ripely opulent flavors of black currants, cherry marmalade, mocha, root beer and caramelized oak. Could have greater structure and a longer finish, but lovely with a charbroiled steak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Here's a simple and correct Valpolicella that opens with vibrant tones of cherry and ripe raspberry. There's not much depth here, but that's not the point of this wine. Employ it as an easy-drinking red to pair with home cooked pasta.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Forward and nicely rounded off, this brings spicy cherry and cranberry fruit front and center. There are well-integrated streaks of herb, a dash of stem, and a dusting of white pepper. Give it an hour or two to breathe, or better yet, decant before drinking.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Generous and creamy perlage opens the stage for deeply fragrant tones of tangerine skin, white flower and peach. The wine is soft and soapy with load of bubbling in the mouth.",Italy-Piedmont-Moscato
"Perfumed aromas offer notes of white flowers, mineral and pink grapefruit. The flavors are dry and elegantly styled with a lingering finish. It will drink well at the dinner table.",US-Washington-Riesling

"This wine is very young, with its bright purple color, spice and wood aromas and firm texture. Although the wood is still integrating, its ripe blackberry fruit and rich texture show it has great potential and needs to age. Drink from 2020.",France-Southwest France-Malbec-Merlot
"This is not a shy wine—it is concentrated and powerful, with ripe tannins and dense black fruits. Coming from vineyards in the Douro Superior, this shows the region's the heat and harsh growing conditions, giving a compact, firm wine with a mineral texture to balance the juicy fruits. It will need several years, so drink from 2017.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This is Drouhan's second vintage of handling the vines, wines and marketing in partnership with the Hospices de Belleville charity. This open generous wine is packed with ripe red fruit and given shape by light tannins. There is a fresh crisp aftertaste that gives the wine a great lift.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Bright berry and red-currant aromas. Lighter in style than Cabs being produced by other LI wineries. The finish turns tough and leathery, not a good match for the delicate fruit.",US-New York-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Solid, luscious and silky smooth, this white wine from the northern Friuli region is one of the most beautiful expressions of the Pinot Bianco grape you'll find. Stone fruit and nutty tones are rich and penetrating and backed by more fruit and white flowers. Half the wine sees four months of oak to shape its creamy consistency and heightened complexity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Bianco

"Brooding aromas of herbs, dark cherries and flowers are followed by supple, polished dark-fruit flavors. It's a promising wine from this young growing region.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc

"Crafted from estate-grown fruit—a marriage of Pommard and Swan clones—Golden Mean comes from three distinct vineyard blocks, the Pommard fermented whole-cluster. It opens with dark, ripe layers of lush cherry-vanilla, the wine concentrated and rich in oak yet balanced in acidity. On the finish is a mix of leather, licorice and wild herb. Tuck it away through 2020–2022.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Notes of poached pear, peach and spice lead to elegant, lightly creamy fruit flavors and a lemony finish. The concentration is light but what's there possesses a good sense of balance.",US-Washington-Chardonnay

"Topel uses the Syrah Noir clone that was originally sourced from M. Chapoutier to make this tasty wine. It's packed with spicy red fruit and smooth, silky tannins. On the finish, it has a leathery tobacco note, with the richness of a cinnamon roll. Enjoy this with meaty dishes.",US-California-Syrah

"One of the first ‘99 Pinots to come out, this puppy from the Napa side of the American Viticultural Area is young and promising. It shows classic notes of plum, sautéed mushroom, vanilla and smoke, and something earthy, midway between chocolate and leather. The aroma is deep; you can inhale it and feel it in your head. Also heady are the flavors, which are sumptuous, rich and complex, with plenty of fruit and spice, very dry and velvety. This workhorse release is quite good, and a fabulous omen of future ‘99 North Coast Pinots to come.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Made from Cold Creek and Wahluke Slope fruit, this pure Syrah is compact and dense, and it reveals blueberry and boysenberry flavors that are set in a frame of coffee-flavored tannins.

"From Shauna Rosenblum, the daughter of Rosenblum Winery's founder, comes this pyrazine-forward bottling, which may wow sommeliers but could confuse the public. The nose is both grape-y and peppery with garden herbs, and then the palate is tart and tangy, which is odd for a Cab. Yet the high-acid approach makes for a bright, stylish and savory wine, worth seeking out a sip.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A dried herb kick is the hallmark of wines made by this producer, and this bottling may wear that note best, its fresh-pressed blackberry aromas accented with thyme and oregano. The palate blends those savory tones with light purple fruit and caramel and coffee touches, finishing on peppery spice.",US-California-Syrah

Lingering in freshness, the acidity is remarkable and memorable, supporting a full-bodied concentration of great flavor.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Almost equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon (with slightly more Merlot), this is a reduced and approachable wine. It's slightly syrupy-thick on the palate, juicy in clove, plum and blueberry.

Cloves, nutmeg, allspice and white pepper are just a few of the spices that tantalize the cherry, orange and cola flavors. The wine feels wonderful in the mouth, rich and long-lasting. Ageable, too, with a window extending beyond 2012.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"There's plenty of cherry pie, red currant, mushroom and sandalwood flavor in this dry Cab Franc, which was blended with a little Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot for complexity. It feels stylish, yet there's a tough, astringent mouthfeel that seems unlikely ever to go away.",US-California-Cabernet Franc

"Crystal-clear aromas of green apples and minerals come with a slight dash of oak.

It's a treat to sip and savor.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Using Grenache sourced from the moderately cool Lonesome Springs Vineyard, this is slightly leafy, with notes of forest floor, blueberry and blackberry.

Good now, after a brief decant.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is pure Cabernet from Red Mountain's Klipsun vineyard; there is nothing subtle or gentle about this wine. It's a powerhouse, sharp and astringent, with edgy flavors of berry and granite.

This wine could go on for another several years at least. Drink through 2021.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Carricante

"Very dry and fairly tannic, it's severe on first sip and hard to appreciate, although there are some good black cherry, cola, leather, oak and black pepper flavors. It's complex in its own way, and gets better as it breathes in the glass. Give it a good, long decanting, and drink it now through 2018. The blend is Mourvèdre, Grenache, Syrah and Counoise, in that order.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"There's a grace and purity to this Pinot Noir that make it particularly recommendable. It's so light and silky, it just glides like a butterfly across the palate.

Delicious now, but it should prosper over the next eight years, at least.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This brawny red conveys aromas of wood shop, oak, spearmint and coffee. The one-dimensional palate displays oak extract, dried red berry, and roasted coffee bean alongside drying wood tannins. It doesn't have enough fruit richness to balance the oak and the heat of alcohol is evident on the midpalate.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"This barrel-aged Godello is about as elegant and elevated as they come.

There is a solid boost of acidity to the tip of the sip and a tantalizing structure, with flavors of Granny Smith apple and lime rinds. This is a full-bodied, even aggressive Sauv Blanc.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

A beautifully lithe and fluid synthesis of ripe and tart orchard fruits is leavened by bright citrus, green pear, Cox's apple and pure ripe Amalfi lemon. There also is a fine hint of discreet herbal lift—chamomile and chervil can be glimpsed here and there. What an aromatic, statuesque beauty.

The acidity, tannins and lightly tasted herbal notes are in perfect proportion. On balance it's a fruit-packed little gem that is immensely enjoyable.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Ripe cherry and blackberry fruit stars in this easy-drinking wine, with oak providing toasty sweetness. It's an everyday, cheeseburger-friendly Merlot.",US-California-Merlot
"Cedarville takes a lot of pride in its Cab, and this definitely screams mightily of its mountain, granite-soiled origins, with a rich mouthfeel and rocky minerality. Fully fruity, though restrained, this Cab has plenty of leathery plushness in the midpalate ending with a finale of dense, dark chocolate.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Chewy, tannic, with a streak of burnt rubber and plastic. The fruit is thin and the wine smoky.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Brambly cassis and raspberry aromas are warm and a touch cooked. This is bullish, heavy and grabby in feel, with big tannins. Blackberry, cassis, herb and chocolate flavors finish ripe and dark. Drink through 2017.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Light, fresh crisp wine, showing a lively series of green fruits, bright acidity and a texture of tight apple skins. A deliciously light, vivid wine. Screwcap.",Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
This wine has smoky wood and rich fruit already well in balance. It offers ripe acidity from its strawberry and red-currant fruits along with a rich texture. The wine is already delicious although it will develop much further. Drink from 2019.,France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Named after the chapel of Château la Gordonne, which is an historic monument, this wine is a rich rendition of ripe red fruits and a generous texture. It is concentrated, with a tannic edge that gives bite to the aftertaste. It could even age a few months and will be great with the Thanksgiving turkey.",France-Provence-Rosé

"Open and ripely fruity, this has fresh acidity, with tight and tangy flavors of lemon zest. A warm, rounded character to the wine puts it firmly as an apéritif.",France-Provence-Rosé
"A beautifully perfumed wine from one of Volnay's top vineyards, this delights with its aromatic red fruits, ripe tannins and balancing acids. It is still settling down and will certainly round out over the next years when its more sumptuous side will come forward.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Herbaceous on the entry, this Cabernet Sauvignon-majority blend has traces of each of the other red Bordeaux varieties. Blackberry and tobacco follow suit, building to a full-bodied experience of highly walled tannins that mellow to a smooth finish.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A blend of 83% Merlot and 17% Cabernet Sauvignon, this robust red is juicy and smoky, offering tastes of blackberry, cassis and mocha. Dusty tannins give a heaviness, accented by black licorice on the finish.",US-California-Red Blend
"This is a soft wine, ripe with apricot and melon flavors. It shows the warmth of the vintage, round and gently fruity. Almonds and a tangy aftertaste give a crisp finish.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"The cherry and berry aromas are friendly and ripe. It feels flush, edgy and a little tannic, with a fresh berry flavor that's bundled with a touch of herb. The tasty berry flavor holds form on the medium-length finish.",Spain-Central Spain-Tempranillo
"There is a bounty of herbally inflected red fruit on the nose of this bottling, with hints of tea, mushroom and pepper, which make for an intriguing but somewhat odd expression. The herbal flavors on the palate are reminiscent of chewing on bay leaves.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sharp, tart and thin, with biting green apple fruit flavors. From a high-acid year in Washington, this definitely shows it.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"One of the best California Tempranillos of this or any vintage, Longoria's '07 establishes a new benchmark for the variety. Finally we have a dry, crisp and complex Tempranillo, filled with cherry, red currant, tobacco, spice, vanilla and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into polished tannins. A delicious, medium-bodied red wine to enjoy with lamb chops, game, or even roast salmon.",US-California-Tempranillo
"This blend of Montepulciano and Sangiovese opens with initial aromas of wet earth and blue flower, along with hints of berry and vanilla. The palate delivers ripe blackberry layered with chocolate, alongside dusty tannins. Not very complex but enjoyable and ready to drink now.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"While there is a herbal character to this wine, its main interest is in the ripe orange and apricot fruits. They cut easily into the acidity and the mineral edge of this attractive ready-to-drink wine.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Dense fairly bold blackberry and dark plum aromas are backed by a plump palate that's braced by a beam of core acidity. Earthy berry flavors come with notes of vanilla, wild herbs and tobacco, while the finish is full and weighty but also juicy. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Coming from the cool 2010 vintage, this wine seems a bit overwrought, with aromas of stewed herbs and cherry. The flavors are full bodied, backed by chewy tannins.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is another of the producer's intellectual exercises in experimental winemaking, made in tiny case-production numbers. It offers so much to think about, from its lemony-crisp and tangy palate to its chalky tannins. Full bodied, it merits attention, veering from herbal to chocolaty in one sip.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"No doubt on the sweet side for a trocken (or maybe just with relatively low acidity), this is medium bodied, with aromas and flavors reminiscent of crushed stone, orange blossom and peach. Drink it over the next several years.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"From a small parcel of 19th-century vines planted on the hill of Saint-Mont, this is a finely structured rich wine. It has dark tannins and dense black fruits that are balanced by acidity. Rich, spicy and full, it still has tannins that will begin to soften shortly. Drink from 2018 until 2024.",France-Southwest France-Red Blend
"Despite some rich blackberry and currant flavors, a rich overlay of oak and smooth tannins, this Cabernet is a little off in texture. It's gritty in the mouth, but it is nicely dry, and has a certain complexity.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"It conveys the purest scent of cut green pears, a crisp but cushioned body, and zesty, citrusy freshness. It's very complete and for immediate consumption.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"Viader has a long history of producing great Bordeaux-style blends grown at a high elevation on Howell Mountain. This 2010 is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, with almost the same percentages as the superb 2009 bottling. The wine is rich, dry and complex. It shows a fantastic array of blackberries, dates and dark chocolate, with fascinating notes of lavender and dill. The tannins are gorgeous, the acidity fine, and the application of oak is deft. It's hard to describe just how good this wine feels in the mouth. Drink now, after decanting, or within the next 20 years.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This 50-50 blend of Marselan and Merlot opens with aromas of raspberry-cran-apple juice and underripe cherry. The light palate offers lithe tannins and a tart, fruit-skin astringency that lingers through the close.",France-France Other-Red Blend
"Distinctive aromatic qualities mark this afforable bottling, an exclusive for Hawaiian supermarket chain Foodland from the team at Terravant Wine Company in Buellton. The aromas recall chaparral scrub, mint tea and black sage. The herbaceousness continues on the palate, with a sticky tannic structure. Not exactly the wine for those seeking a red fruit experience, but good for those seeking the savory side of the grape.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The best Sassicaia of the last 10 years, the 2004 vintage is an outstanding achievement. Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc highlight the beauty of Tuscany and portray the region in terms of thick chocolate fudge, succulent cherry and currant, exotic spice and vanilla seed. Beyond those big aromas are little teasers: blue flowers, Mediterranean herbs, cola and light mineral shadings. It's lush and full in the mouth and will hold 20 or 30 years.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"An aromatic wine with notes of spice, lychee and grapefruit. It's medium sweet with the fruit flavors a bit wanting in concentration.",US-Washington-Gewürztraminer
"Dark and extracted, this has firm, dry tannins. It's hard edged, but the potential of the black currant fruit is apparent. Give this structured wine at least five years for the rich fruit to surface.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This Tempranillo is a heavy, saturated number with rubbery plum and berry aromas. It's totally Argentinean in style and shares little to nothing with Spanish versions; it's full bodied but not showing much in the midpalate, while generic berry flavors offer chocolate notes and finish short.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Tempranillo
"An intriguing blend of grapes with both Bordeaux and Gaillac origins has produced a wine that has a softly herbal character as well as richer white stone fruits and an attractive perfume. It is a pretty wine, ready to drink and very fruity.",France-Southwest France-White Blend
"The hinted lushness of passion fruit plays intriguingly around the straight-laced acidity of this classy Sauvignon Blanc. The body is light but profound. Very refreshing on its own or with light, delicate foods.",Austria-Südsteiermark-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine is so ripe, rich and generous in flavor it's almost jammy, but there's no denying the appeal of all that fruitiness. Full body, velvety texture and soft acidity make it plush on the palate, helping the rich finish linger. Although it was aged in French barriques—two-thirds new—it's by no means an overoaked wine.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Developing well already, this is a textured, steely, very mineral wine that has also has rich stone fruits that give the wine weight and flavor density. Apples and fennel lend freshness and spice. It should age longer, so wait to drink until 2015.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Leonetti's 2010 Reserve includes 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 9% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec—a more complex blend than the 2009. It opens with a lovely floral aroma—a bouquet of clover and white flowers—then heads for the dark side, with black cherry and cassis. It's a big, tannic wine, beautifully crafted, and clearly differentiated from the winery's regular Cabernet bottling.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This smells like plums and blueberries, tastes smooth and rather rich, showing light spicy, oak accents over the plummy flavors. It's medium bodied, rather light on tannins and acidity, so it has a soft texture overall.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Rosemary-marinated steak, roast pork roll stuffed with prunes or dark chicken or turkey meat would make perfect paring partners to this red blend from southern Tuscany. Aromas of spice, mature cherry and leather are soft and penetrating.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"Charred, toasty oak aromas lend a note of maple to the nose of this pulling, tannic, high-acid Tinto Fino. Lemony oak, plum, wild berry and savory, saucy flavors finish with scraping tannins. Drink this single-vineyard ball of power 2019–2030.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"New oak (38%) vies with green apple butter and pineapple crême brulée flavors to dominate this wine, with neither winning out, suggesting that it's balanced. It's a very pretty, creamy, slightly sweet Chardonnay, balanced with brisk acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Mocha, raspberry, sour cherry and spice are the focus of this plucky red from Skouras. The wine has focus and a masculine edge, and should pair well with dried meats, spicy pasta sauces and salty cheeses.",Greece-Nemea-Agiorgitiko
"This opens with dark aromas of leather, tobacco, cured meat, plum and prune. It shows soft tannins and loads of dark fruit on the finish.",Italy-Central Italy-Montepulciano
Red fruits and banana aromas lead to a wine that has a lightly tannic touch over bright cherry fruits. Intense acidity and a herbaceous character come from grapes that are barely ripe. Drink now.,France-Beaujolais-Gamay
There's a certain elegance to this Dolcetto that distinguishes it in a crowd. The fruit element is bright and strong and the wine shows generous layers of raspberry and cherry on the close.,Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto

"A light style, with straightforward citrus and green apple fruit, this widely available Chardonnay is clean and generic, unoaked and bone dry.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"This is a medium-sweet wine, very fresh while also with some richness. A creamed-apple texture is given a more exotic touch with white peach flavors and freshened with bright acidity. It would be good with Asian food. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"A delicious Sauvignon Blanc. Make it drier, and it would be perfect. As it is, it's a little too sugary sweet in pineapples, lemons and oranges, but crisp acidity and a firm minerality help to restore balance.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Tremendously delicious, this bottling combines hedonistic flair with elegant depth, satisfying both carnal and intellectual desires. Waves of hot cherry pie with vanilla ice cream and cola spice show on the nose, but the sip grows more dry and refined. Black cherry is enhanced with crushed nutmeg, black pepper and a pinch of dill, balanced via underlying acidity and a leathery tannic frame.",US-California-Merlot
"With the potential of a good structure and fruit, this is a warm ripe wine that has concentration and dense black fruits. The acidity at the end gives it a lift. Wait until 2019 to drink this Hervé Lhuillier wine.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is the softest of the three single vineyard wines from Château de Fuissé. It has a warm, rich character, generous and full in the mouth.

"This bottling from neutral barrels is reserved on the nose, showing dust, light red fruit and earth aromas. The flavors are equally light, evoking red mulberry fruit and turned earth. Clean and quaffable, but not very exciting.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A wonderfully aromatic nose of blossom and Conference pear is very appetizing. The palate comes in with pear-fruited generosity and an almost oily mouthfeel that speaks of the power of this concentrated wine. There is a pleasant edge of pithy bitterness that acts as a counterpoint to the inherent richness and ripeness of the fruit alongside fresh acidity. This is balanced and rounded and just off dry with a lovely, fresh structure that echoes long. There is great aging potential here. Drink 2017–2030.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"This white from southern Italy offers a delicate fragrance of yellow flowers with a hint of tropical fruit, vanilla and spice. The palate delivers creamy golden apple, citrus and lemon drop along with crisp acidity.",Italy-Central Italy-Trebbiano

"Pouilly-Fumé is often the source of wines for the Sancerre producers. This wine is ripe, full in the mouth with its yellow fruits. There is a spicy character from the oak aging. The wine could age a little longer so drink from 2018.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc

The mouthfeel is chewy, velvety and succulent and the wine will appeal to those who enjoy hot climate reds.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"This collaboration between American winemakers Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton and Japanese entrepreneur Takahide Sugimoto is stunningly high-toned and buttoned-up at first, with sour cream, yogurt, crushed ant, gunmetal, flint and quinine elements on the nose. The palate is complex and fascinating, with chalk and cement minerality bolstered by lime blossom, kumquat and tonic that opens graciously with time. Drink 2016–2026.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This Barbaresco offers remarkable aromatic intensity and complexity that takes the form of white chocolate, small red berries, cola, road tar and red licorice. Based on the boldness of the nose, you'd expect the mouthfeel to be pulpy and fat. Instead, it is elegantly linear and tightly packed.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Clarissa Nagy, whose main job is making wine for Riverbench, sources grapes from the nearby Garey Ranch Vineyard for this bottling. It shows strawberry, plum blossom, beet juice, rose petals and cola on the nose. The palate is light and easy, with flavors of pencil lead, Earl Grey tea and brisk cranberry juice.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Grassy, lightly weedy aromas set up a palate with sweet citrus and melony flavors. This is sticky and a touch mealy come finishing time, with a fleshy, unctuous feel and only modest structure and acidity.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Torrontés
"Intense but rather muddled aromas of Stargazer lily and air freshener lead the nose along with brief dashes of hay, mature peach and apple. The unusual flowery aroma carries through and dominates the lean palate.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sämling, this gold straw colored wine is about freshness and acidity as much as about sweetness. That gives this ageworthy wine a great delicacy and poise, balanced and fresh, the honey botrytis texture attractively layered through this delicious wine.",Austria-Burgenland-Austrian white blend
"The nose on this bottling shows fresh boysenberry and primary grape scents, with lots of sweet rosemary and purple flower nuance. The sip is not overly complicated, with tar at first and then waves of blackberry and boysenberry fruit, lifted by thyme and peppercorns.",US-California-Syrah
"From the eastern vineyards of the Douro, in Douro Superior, this estate wine is heavily structured while showing rich fruit and impressive tannins. The texture is strongly mineral, complex and hinting at the concentration from fruit grown in this hot, dry climate. Drink from 2016.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"From the historic family-owned vineyard down a ways on Westside Road, this Bacigalupi wine is richer and more layered than some of the producer's other vineyard-designates, providing a meatier, more tropical edge of fleshy butter and nuttiness. The aromatics balance things out, sharing whispers of orange blossom and caramel.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A lovely example of Pinot Noir from one of the rare places in Washington that can do the flighty grape justice. It is a 50/50 blend of the 2008 and 2009 vintage—a crafty winemaker decision that has worked beautifully. The wine strikes a perfect balance, neither too young and sharp, nor too soft and fruity. Light touches of cedar and smoke wrap around fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry pie. It stops a little short at the moment, but that might just be a function of limited bottle age.",US-Washington-Pinot Noir
"Ripe and lush, this off-dry Gewürztraminer shows remarkable balance between its acidity and ripeness. It has abundant rose petal, spice and musk tones, and the exotic spice note intensifies on the midpalate, before extending toward the jasmine-tea-flavored finish.",US-New York-Gewürztraminer
"This is a very lush Cab, made in the modern style. All the elements of cult Cab are there: the soft voluptuousness, the finely ground, sweet tannins, the immensely ripe currant, blackberry and cocoa flavors, the coating of fine, smoky oak. I don't think it's an ager because of the softness and ripeness.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Green apple and honeydew melon aromas carry right through to the fresh, fruity flavors in this light-bodied and round-textured wine. It has touches of butter and vanilla as well as all that fruit, plus a good balance between crispness and ripeness.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Dark chocolate notes join acidity and ripe black fruit flavors. The wood is dominant in this relatively soft wine, although the fruit juiciness comes through well to finish.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
This sparkling wine has a delicate fragrance of spring flowers and flavors of white fruit. Simple but well made and refreshing.,Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Cherry flavors turn a bit syrupy, with a sour cherry candy appeal. Acidic and slightly volatile, this tight, chewy wine spent 14 months in 40% new French oak barrels.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Tantara's take on the historic Chalone AVA, which is full of limestone marl and clay near the Pinnacles National Park, kicks off with dusty aromas of red earth, light menthol and raspberry-flavored Smarties candy. Strawberry, dried cherries, sage and herbs combine for unique, memorable flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"A blend of Syrah and Alicante, this opens with aromas of underbrush, toasted wood, espresso and a whiff of exotic spice. On the palate, the fruit is almost completely dried up, leaving prune and oak-driven sensations of coffee and licorice alongside drying tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"A sweet nose of oak spice, almond marzipan and cherry cola makes for a nice first impression. It boasts loads of balsam intensity with cola, ginger and black licorice. It's ripe, chewy and covers the palate while delivering tight structure on the long finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Crushed bricks, rose petals, red currants and grape syrup are sprinkled with elegant black spices in this blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot by Steve and Chrystal Clifton. The palate is silky, redolent with mulberry and tart plums skins, amped up by sagebrush and thyme. It's perfect for a variety of foods.",US-California-Red Blend
"It was barrel-fermented, using wild yeasts, and aged on the lees. The vineyard is in the coolest part of Napa Valley, and in this cool vintage, acidity is the most important part of the wine. Crisp and biting, it lends structural authority to the Meyer lemon, lime, tangerine, fig, mineral, vanilla and white pepper flavors. The alcohol level has been kept to a modest 13.8%. A welcome addition to California's Sauvignon Blanc pantheon.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Made entirely from Cabernet Sauvignon, this stylish wine opens with aromas of red berry, Mediterranean herb and cedar. The juicy, elegantly structured palate doles out red currant, black raspberry, licorice and white pepper alongside silky tannins. Drink now–2024.",Italy-Tuscany-Cabernet Sauvignon

"The wine is soft, creamy and ripe. It has white fruits and just enough acidity. With its lightly perfumed character, apricot and green fruits in balance, it is ready to drink.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese White
"Good and complex, but smells a little candied, like mint cherry-scented toothpaste, and tastes sweetly jammy in cherries. This all-Pommard clone Pinot may be going through a mute phase. Try holding for several months.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Intense in herbal cranberry and cassis, this Livermore Cab Franc has a touch of spiciness and a leathery finish.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
It's well-suited for supplying a big party where there are lots of different tastes to please. A soft texture and almost sweet butter and apple flavors make this a light confection.,US-California-Chardonnay
"Bold fruit layers of red cherry, plum, blackberry, spice, cola and chocolate mark this wine. The quality of the fruit is still raw and bright and could use several years of cellar aging.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"The winemaker left in a little residual sugar, which gives this pleasant wine a pineapple jam, green apple pie, vanilla sorbet and honeysuckle taste. It's balanced with crisp acidity. From the Los Alamos region, which should have its own appellation status.",US-California-Chenin Blanc
"Equal parts Syrah and Merlot with a dash of Mourvèdre and Cabernet Franc (3% each), this wine brings notes of biscuit, cherry, dill and dried cranberry. Like many wines from this vintage in Washington, it's quite tart out of the gate, supported by chewy tannins.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"A rainy cement minerality on the nose of this sweet wine manages to cut through the sugared oranges, honeysuckle and ripe, tropical white fleshed fruit, from peach to cherimoya. The palate is full of honeyed apples, white peach and pineapple, but the decent acidity and chalky element stops it short of treacly.",US-California-Gewürztraminer
"Quite spicy, with cinnamon and peppery cherry, raspberry, black currant, anise, tea and plum notes. Smooth, silky tannins frame it all, with a mellow finish. Quite nice. Editors' Choice.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Fairly heavy and full, with a powerfully spicy and chocolaty nose. Dark-fruit and herb tastes are accented by a strong shot of coffee from the oak. The finish is tannic and drying, with more of that coffee and also some notes of licorice. Perfectly chunky, in the Napa/Oakville style.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is as lush as apricots, pineapples and peach juice, but with refreshing acidity. Ample honey and buttered-toast notes from oak give it warmth. It's a very good Chard for drinking now with rich shellfish dishes, or a buttery wild mushroom risotto.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A bit heavy and sweet, with big lemon-lime aromas followed by cloying pear and mango flavors. It's more creamy and sticky than desirable, but the core flavors are admirable and you can't take issue with its purity. Would be better if it were more agile.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Torrontés
"This well-crafted wine is reflective of the vintage, which brought its share of challenges. Tea-leaf flavors run throughout, along with quite light red fruits and plenty of acid. The finish is on the green side, but not so much that it's detrimental. Drink this wine while cellaring the bigger wines from riper years.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This single -vineyard Syrah, from an AVA known for doing especially well with that grape, has a lightly meaty varietal character with accents of earth and tobacco. The core of cherry fruit holds up through a medium-length finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Hot and Porty, with baked cherry and chocolate flavors in a heavy texture. A Rhône blend based on Syrah.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"While this wine is dark and packed with tannins, it has the fruit weight potential to compensate. It is a firm wine, solid with ripe tannins and blackberry flavors. The acidity at the end promises a good future, so drink from 2022. Lucien Lurton took over Bouscaut in 1979. Since 1992, has been in the hands of daughter Sophie Lurton and her husband Laurent Cogombles. Investments include vineyard renovation, a barrel cellar in 2010 and a B&B in 2013.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"A dense wine, powerful while also elegant. It shows all the best character of a grand Margaux, with fine tannins as well as dense structure. It will age well.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Here is a lightly sweet, fresh wine that has crisp red-currant and raspberry flavors. It's bright, clean and ready to drink now.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Rosé
"Oak, yellow apple and butterscotch aromas open on the nose. The structured palate offers toast, mineral, oak-driven spice and a confectionary note but it's shy on fruit richness. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the close.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"A wine that has good concentration from the very old vines along with red cherry fruits and some tight, mineral acidity. The banana character does spoil the overall ripe, full effect, so give the wine another year for this to disappear. Acidity and tannins do promise this aging.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This may not be as potent or complex as Colombier's Cuvée Gaby, but it comes close, which makes it an excellent value. Meaty, savory notes are ideally suited for accompanying autumn game or winter stews, yet the tannins are supple, making it approachable already.",France-Rhône Valley-Syrah
"Hailing from Conner Lee Vineyard, this barrel-fermented wine was aged in two-thirds new French oak. It has aromas of toast, char, nut oil and lemon. The flavors seem faint by comparison, with the concentration not all there.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Soft notes of straw and honeycomb grace the orange and red apple fruit tones. The mouthfeel is round and a touch flat on the midpalate, finishing with a bitter almond flavor. Drink now.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Chenin Blanc
"A nicely structured wine with a sizable component of Petite Sirah and 3% Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers a density of oak and tannin on the entry, offset by a juicy backbone of blackberry and cherry. Full bodied, it has the elements to last, being completely drinkable now through 2020.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Very pure notes of Conference pear rise from the glass and promise freshness. The palate reprises the same fruitiness but streamlines it with grapefruit zest and juicy bone-dry concentration. This is bright and sprightly, energetic and invigorating, slender but packed with flavor. The finish is uncompromisingly fresh and dry.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"Aromas of ripe black currant, spice, pressed violet, scorched earth and a whiff of cedar emerge on this boldly structured red. The full-bodied palate delivers dried blackberry, raisin, licorice and chewing tobacco, accompanied by firm, chewy tannins. A black pepper note signals the close.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"The new oak on this Cab Franc is strong. So is the fruit, which suggests red cherries and blackberries so ripe the juice runs down your chin. But the wood and fruit haven't come together. They're slugging it out for supremecy. No reason to have to choose between them. Give it 6–8 years in a good cellar and let everything come together.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"This wine has a tight structure that's laced with wood. The complex fruit is still settling into the structure, promising richness. Age this for at least five years.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A sweet smell of honeysuckle and grapefruit candy permeates the nose of this bottling, along with cut honeydew melon and apple blossom. Sugary mandarin juice is the primary flavor on the palate, but it's properly offset by acidity a chalky texture.",US-California-Riesling
"On the reserved side, this trim wine has subtle fruit and vanilla aromas, mild apple and butter flavors and a good balance between acidity and ripeness. It's a good value and a great choice for a non-showy wine.",US-California-Chardonnay
"An easy wine, with ripe citrus, apricot, apple and honey flavors, brightened by crisp acidity.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"This opens with delicate aromas of white peach, vanilla and toasted oak that carry over to the palate along with candied lemon drop and apple. Zesty acidity gives it a tangy finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"There's a new wave of rosé in California, of which this is a good example. It's dry, delicate and crisp, with subtle orange tea, pink grapefruit, spice and mineral flavors. Winemaker Emily Richer has done a great job taming the Cabernet Franc for this rosé wine.",US-California-Rosé
"Honeyed pear and caramel scents inform the nose of this wine from the cool climate subdistrict of the Russian River Valley. Creamy in texture, it's full-bodied but not overbearing, with a focus that never veers, the finish awash in salty tones.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Two thirds Boushey Vineyard, and one third Red Willow, this pure Sauvignon Blanc has not yet completely knit itself together. There's a solid core of clean and tangy ripe lemon, citrus and pineapple fruit. The finish is where it lacks some focus, and may benefit from another year or two of bottle age.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"Toast and mocha scents and flavors surround a core of tart red berries. More barrel influence comes out as the wine breathes—clove, spice and smoke—as it rolls into a tightly-wrapped, tannic finish. Give this a lot of aeration, or tuck it away for another five or six years.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine reflects both the challenge and some of the enjoyment of the cool 2011 vintage in Washington. Aromas of green herbs intermingle with barrel spices. It's elegantly styled with abundant vanilla, coffee and cherry flavors.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is rich, almost unctuous, in terms of mouthfeel. That roundness, coupled with the bright golden hue, suggest that this wine may have been barrel aged. Some aromatic traces of talcum powder remain, drifting above chunky fruit flavors of pineapple and peach. The finish is full bodied and lightly toasty.",US-Oregon-Gewürztraminer
"One of the drier, crisper white Rhône-style wines out there, and hence one of the best. These Viognier, Grenache Blanc and Marsanne blends tend to be too sweet, but this one's firm and minerally. Brisk acidity highlights zesty lime, pear and white flower notes.",US-California-White Blend
"A soft wine, favoring warm fruit, pear and peach flavors, the minerality coming later. The wine is crisp and fresh, with an intensity of acidity rare in 2009. That suggests it will age, although it is already fruity and refreshing.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Made by a Rhône-based winery, this wine is smooth and ripe. It has generous strawberry and light spice flavors along with a rounded aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Pepper, lavender, cranberry and iodine aromas lead the nose of this easy-drinking blend of 41% Petit Sirah, 40% Syrah, 10% Mourvèdre and 9% Grenache. The palate is tense and tart, its dried red fruit melding with graphite, nori and black pepper flavors.",US-California-Red Blend
"A touch of dried apple skin and cinnamon stick open the nose of this hearty, red dessert wine. It presents tight tannins, with a sweet, chewy chocolate aftertaste.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"A great effort, with mountain-grown fruit, high-altitude acids that give the flavors shape and cut, tightening up and brightening up the sharp, wild berry fruit. Iron filings and stone add a strong mineral element as well; this is the best yet from Dumas Station.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Earthy aromas of tobacco, olive, tree bark and lemon peel are herbal and a bit green. This is a blend of Cab Sauvignon, Merlot, Carmenère and Lagrima Christi; it's fairly minty on the flavor profile, with olive and overt oak leading the way. A resiny, green-tasting finish is drawing but fair.",Chile-Maule Valley-Red Blend
"This crisp wine is packed with delicious fruit and balanced acidity. It shows some of the richness of the vintage, but goes more in a tangy, mineral direction. With lively acidity, it is refreshing and ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A blend of Syrah and Mourvèdre, this is a lovely, polished and serious red wine. It impresses not just for the well-ripened cassis, cherry, cocoa and cedar flavors, but for the overall balance, and the smoothness of the texture.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This light, easygoing Pinot Blanc is fruity with apples and white fruits, while gently creamy and balanced with some spice. The soft fruit and the bite of spice give some complexity at the end.",France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"Ripe, rounded peach flavors with an earthy edge on the nose give way to a tingling, peppery, grassy and grapefruit-driven palate full of zing and crispness. This is tingling and fresh. Drink soon.",Austria-Burgenland-Sauvignon Blanc
"Typical aromas of ripe peach, melon and white flowers are elevated on the nose. A slightly oily palate houses floral tones up front, leading to juicy nectarine on the midpalate. A playful, fuzzy feeling round out the finish.",US-Virginia-Viognier
"All varietal from one of the state's most highly regarded vineyards, this wine offers aromas of dark raspberries, green herbs, vanilla and barrel spices. The fruit and barrel flavors show concentration and depth, with a light chalkiness to the tannins.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Gavin Chanin's wines manage to pack a stunning array of elements behind a veil of restraint, here showing sea salt, lemon skins, struck flint and smoked nectarine on the nose. The palate is alkaline and botanical in presentation, offering lime skin, chalk, dried butter flakes, cement and a salty acidity. The wine tastes like foggy sunshine.",US-California-Chardonnay
"88—90 Barrel sample. Somewhat lean, more of solid tannin than fruit. But there is also some fresh acidity.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This opens with aromas of blackberry, truffle and forest floor. The firm palate offers ripe black cherry, plum, espresso and clove alongside round, chewy tannins. It's already accessible and will also offer lots of near and mid-term enjoyment.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Opens with a complex nose of cherry, plum, cocoa and leather elements that promise much. On the palate, however, it turns much more tart—even sharp—with mild cherry fruit and a light body. Finishes with modest length and a sour cranberry-herb note.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Minty, earthy aromas suggest Christmas spice and fruit cake. This is saturated but a bit soupy and drying. Flavors of prune, plum, raisin and spices are a touch stewed, while this finishes ripe but short on freshness.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This earthy wine features aromas of truffle, ripe plum, leather and just a whiff of barnyard. The palate offers black cherry, crushed raspberry and notes of baking spice alongside assertive tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"The vineyard sits at nearly a half-mile in elevation, and you'll find true mountain concentration to the blackberry jam, black cherry, raspberry, licorice, pepper and molasses flavors. The alcohol is quite high, but the wine feels rich and balanced.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Pointed, toasty aromas of black fruits and graphite are lemony, woody and not bashful. A giant palate with rock-hard, piercing tannins is drying but generous. Flavors of wild berries, earth and oak finish toasty and tannic, with lasting acidity. Drink through 2023.",Spain-Northern Spain-Mencía
"This straightforward wine is crisp and refreshing. The nose is charming, with aromas of apples and lemon. Light on the tongue, it shows a pure fruit expression unencumbered by excessive oak or butter flavors. Try with grilled seafood dishes.",US-Virginia-Chardonnay
"Milk chocolate, blue berries, caramel sauce and sweet wood aromas create the impression of a somewhat reduced and confected Shiraz. But the palate comes forward with more vibrant and fresh fruit flavors of raspberry, plum and cherry to keep the sweetness from going overboard and overwhelming the wine. Overall, it's balanced and approachable with a solid, clean finish.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Shiraz
"This is full bodied and creamy textured, but still retains a sense of vibrancy and freshness. Black pepper notes help in that regard, spicing up the flavors of plum, mocha and roasted meat. It's plush, rich and long on the finish. Drink now–2025.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"It's a treat to find an aromatic wine that's this dry, light-bodied and steely in character. The wine has white peach flavors, great acidity and a truly appetizing texture that fits the classic definition of an aperitif: something to whet the appetite.",US-California-Gewürztraminer
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Malbec, this wine exudes complex aromas of leafy herbs, pencil lead, black licorice, citrus peel and dark cherries. On the palate, the blue and red fruit flavors are front and center, well framed by lively acidity and lick of tannins.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Cascina Saria is a relatively new producer in the Langhe, although the family has been growing grapes for generations. This Barbaresco shows tart aromas of berry fruit and white cherry, but it also offers accents of red apple, spice, wet earth and smoked bacon. There's more heft and consistency in the mouth, and the fruit flavors show the thick and chewy qualities of a hot vintage.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Extremely flavorful and wonderfully exotic, this full-bodied wine has intense fruit flavors like raspberry and rhubarb, with a host of interesting accents recalling cedar, white pepper and clove. The mouthfeel is warm and rich, tannins are soft and easy, and the finish lingers nicely.",US-California-Grenache
"This gorgeous Barolo has a penetrating, dark color and generous aromas of black cherry, tar, leather, tobacco, spice, black truffle and Spanish cedar. The intensity and power is impressive, and the mouthfeel is packed tight with ripe fruit flavors and a bold structure. Hold for 10–20 years to let those tannins evolve.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Vermentino makes a great companion to sushi, Mediterranean fish dishes, light pasta salad or chicken salad. There's a zesty touch of fresh sage or rosemary on the nose followed by peach, citrus and melon aromas.",Italy-Tuscany-Vermentino
"An aroma of pure lychee announces a wine that is attractively balanced. It wears its richness easily; it's ripe and fruity, with a good level of acidity. With a medium-sweet character, it is a great wine for Asian cuisine.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"A fresh, high-acid wine, with flavors of raspberry and apple. It's crisp, with fruit that is barely ripe. Needs plenty of chilling.",France-Provence-Rosé
"A bit too pungent and sweaty to score higher, with pronounced and aggressive nettley aromas and flavors. It's round in the mouth, finishing herbal and green. Some will no doubt praise it for these same qualities.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Delicately redolent of pear, melon and stone fruit, this is a fresh and direct Pinot Grigio that leaves a nice trail of zest over the palate. This wine also has nice consistency and structure that is immediately recognized by the thicker trails of glycerin it leaves on the glass: It offers full fruit flavors and bright acidity on the close.",Italy-Veneto-Pinot Grigio
"Offering aromas of sweet peach, this is a round, full Sauvignon Blanc with a pleasant texture. Light in alcohol but rich on the finish, it just begs for shellfish or melted goat cheese salad.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Cabernet Sauvignon (37%) and Cabernet Franc (34%) make up the majority of this wine, with the balance Merlot (16%), Malbec (8%) and Petit Verdot. The aromas are quite locked up, with light notes of barrel spice, herb and assorted dark fruit. The palate has light tightly coiled fruit flavors. It needs time to reveal its charms. Best after 2021.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A majority of Cabernet Sauvignon is blended with 22% Merlot in this woody, somewhat herbal and robustly intense red, impacted in subtle ways by oak. The finish is meager.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Again in 2009 this barrel selection from Adelsheim's best estate vineyards is a standout. Though still quite young and tight, the mix of ripe fruits, brown spices, cedar and smoke make for a beguiling nose that promises a long life ahead. Silky and elegant, but let it breathe or better yet cellar it for another half decade.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This is a raisiny Cabernet, tannic and slightly coarse. Drink it now with barbecue or beef stews.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Quite yellow in the glass, this bottling shows cohesive and familiar aromas of buttered toast, jasmine, orange marmalade, sandalwood and smoke on the nose. The palate packs lemon and butter together with walnut oil, proving quite rich and even heavy at times.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Shows the hallmarks of a fine Mount Veeder Cabernet, namely immediate succulence, intensely concentrated mountain fruit, and yet an almost certain capacity to age. Lush, ripe flavors of blackberries and crème de cassis lead to a long, soft finish. Drink now–2018.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The flint and chalk nature of the soil shows in this wine. From old vines well situated in the Premier Cru of Montmains, it has concentration and a tight, young texture that will need to develop. It is fresh and full of citrus now, although a riper, creamy character will be coming through as it matures. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Char, clove and rubber aromas dominate what's otherwise leafy and herbal. A tight, hard-tannin palate features peppery, bitter flavors of black fruits in front of a pinched, narrow-feeling finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is the most attractive and successful of the winery's three releases of 2007 Pinot Noir. It's dry and crisp in acidity and very rich, with oak-inspired waves of cherries, cola, mushu plum sauce and smoky sandalwood. Drink this elegant wine in the next year or two.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A juicy wine, it has soft tannins and gently stalky fruit textures. Black currant fruits accompany fresh, tangy acidity. Not for aging, so drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A delightful blend of cracked black pepper, blackberries and hung game aromas lead into a surprisingly plush mouthfeel that's laden with cherry and berry fruit. The finish blends in some dark coffee flavors for extra complexity.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Fresh pressed blackberry and boysenberry scents meet wet clay and gravel on the nose of this bottling from one of Paso Robles' cooler corners. Vibrant acidity shows on the palate, with light tannins that frame its plump berry and graphite flavors.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Overripe, jammy fruit aromas and flavors spoil this wine. It's oddly balanced: soft on the one hand and tough on the other.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A co-fermented blend of 97% Syrah and 3% Viognier, this wine has a bouquet of black cherry, chocolate covered espresso bean and rose petal. It is a nicely crafted wine that offers flavors of blackberry, cranberry, sambuca and sage. Velvety tannins persist through a long lasting finish that is punctuated by bursts of fresh fruit.",Israel-Galilee-Red Blend
"The savoriness of yeast still lingers on the nose of this wine. The palate brings herbal and sage-like notes to the fore, highlighting its concentrated, rich flavor. Citrus overtones herald the finish, while the saltiness demands you take another sip.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"Gorgeous fruit aromas and flavors fill out this plush-textured and softly balanced wine. It offers ripe black cherry and raspberry tones and a full body, but has a delightful, light touch on the palate. The finish lingers nicely, too.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Bright and dense, totally packed with dark fruits and aromas, this young and brambly blend brings tart, wild berry, cassis and smoky espresso into play full force. There's black licorice also, coffee grounds, and powerful tannins, along with the acids to age.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This is a tasty and fruity wine. It's front loaded with a juicy mix of apple and fresh sliced pear. Fermented entirely in stainless steel, it fills the mouth with flavor and a pleasing, textural grip.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Initially earthy, this needs a few minutes to blossom into an elegant, structured wine, with black cherry flavors, firm dry tannins and a smooth finish.",France-Loire Valley-Cabernet Franc
"Soft and ripe, it has attractive peach and pear fruits and a lively shot of lemon acidity. It's rounded, rich and ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc

"Black-cherry fruit shows on the nose of this bottling by Silicon Valley veterans T.J. and Valeta Rodgers, but it is deftly hidden behind layers of earth and herbs, from dark clay and black pepper to budding violets and rosemary. The acidity is slowly simmering on the palate, unleashing flavors of dark chocolate, cinnamon, more rosemary, blackberry and pencil-lead minerality.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This light, clear wine is varietal in approach and silky texture, also offering a tension of high acidity, forest floor and nervy, cool-climate fruit. From a vineyard overlooking Freestone, it speaks to site and taste with classy effectiveness.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Cranberry, baked plum, black pepper and cigar play against secondary characteristics of black licorice in this well-crafted, balanced wine. Thick, yet structured, it juggles a layering of minerality against a richness of fruit, each complementing the other.",US-California-Syrah
"This wine has a compelling earthy funkiness that's both varietal and fun, a tangle of red fruit, sassafras and cardamom that's light and bright. It makes a great companion to food.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"From vines nearly 30 years in age, this is Pinard's immediately attractive, drink-now wine. Fresh lemon and grapefruit flavors are lightly herbal in character. Juicy, lively and crisp, it's ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc

"Hints of honey, caramel and spice lend extra richness to tropical citrus and mango flavors in this bold, barrel-fermented Chardonnay. It's a plush, sunny wine with forward, fruity appeal and an orange-rind finish.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Funky yeast still holds sway on the nose. Underneath that are notions of ripe juicy pear and a soft hint of vanilla. The palate strikes a sonorous balance between smoky vanilla and gently peppered pears. There is concentration and promise. The finish is nutty and very long. This is still tightly closed and needs to unfurl, but will become a great gastronomic wine. Drink 2019–2025.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"Complex aromas and flavors of blackberries, leather, roasted meat and coffee show plenty of class, and this wine appears to firm up in the glass, offering more structure than its initial suppleness and amplitude suggest. It may close up for a few years, so try it now, or hold and try it after 2012.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Bright, generous and straightforward, Soave Classico San Michele makes a perfect pairing partner to white asparagus or spring peas. The wine delivers pretty aromas of honey, peach and grapefruit.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"This Bordeaux blend, based on equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is softly opulent and ripe, in the way of many Paso Robles red wines. It floods the mouth with blackberries and currants, with spicy complexities from oak, and is fairly tannic, although not so much that a good steak won't cut through it. Best Now–2012.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Shows all the hallmarks of the modern style of Chardonnay, with lots of ripe citrus and oak. The wine has too much oak, though, and is dominated by caramelized wood and sweet vanilla flavors that swamp the fruit.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The fruity, jammy forwardness of this Pinot makes you think it will develop in the cellar, but it's a little too soft for extended aging. So give it a good decanting, and enjoy the raspberries, cherries and opulent new oak over the next year or two.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Freesia and tangerine rind scent this bright, aromatic wine. It's dry in style, yet luscious and ripe, streaked with tones of honey tangerines and peach. Bristling lime acidity lends cut and vibe to the finish.",Germany-Rheinhessen-Riesling
"Leaping Lizard is turning out good value wines that show true varietal character. This Sauvignon Blanc, which doesn't seem to have any oak, shows crisp, bright flavors of pineapples, apricots and spices. It's a bit on the sweet side, but with good balancing acidity.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Restrained both aromatically and on the palate, this Riesling offers modest hints of green apple and pear combined with a slightly herbal note. There's not a lot of complexity or concentration, but it's a brisk, refreshing wine.",US-New York-Riesling

"This gorgeous, full-bodied and compelling wine is made from 84% Chardonnay and 16% Pinot Noir. It has a rich golden color, slightly earthy aromas, plus bread dough and white-peach scents that lead to very opulent, sophisticated and nicely aged flavors that range from toasted walnut to honeyed peach to white pepper. While it's already nine years old, this will easily age through 2022.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"The Shea designate brings a complex mix of red fruits, along with threads of nougat, graham cracker, toast and caramel. It's so well integrated that it's completely seamless, with outstanding length and focus.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This crisp, delicate Blanc de Blancs is full of white fruit, but steely and citrusy on the palate. Taut, tight and complex with a layered acidity, this is a nervy, textured wine. Although it is ready to drink now, a few more months in the bottle will make it even better.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
2011 was a great year for Sauternes and this second wine of Rieussec shows great botrytis weight and richness as well as a floral and fruity character. Bitter orange marmalade and honey give this still-youthful wine its sweeter and fruitier side. Drink from 2016.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Flavors of pear and white peach drive this clean, fruity wine. It has a tang of citrus and acidity that adds a lively edge. Ready to drink now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese White
"This is a hugely dense wine, still firm with its dusty tannins and solid with concentrated black fruits. Despite all this power, the wine has style and a sense of elegance that will stand it in good stead as it matures. It is certainly not yet ready and should be aged until 2019.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"The Freedom Hill selection from Ken Wright has never been better than this exceptionally rich, dark and dense Pinot Noir. Black cherry, smoke, earth and chocolate intertwine in a remarkably smooth, long, complex and extended finish. A sensational wine to enjoy right now.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Made entirely with Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of toasted oak, scorched earth, underbrush and a balsamic whiff of eucalyptus. The dense palate offers blackberry jam, licorice, cured meat and a confectionery note alongside chewy, close-grained tannins. It's a bit shy on freshness, so drink sooner rather than later.",Italy-Tuscany-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Stiff and steely, this herbal and tannic Cabernet has an interesting dusty component like a simpler version of a Rutherford (Napa) red. But rather than developing further complexity, it quickly fades away.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The name and packaging scream “concept wine,” but what's in the bottle will win you over. It's full and rubbery, with pleasant yet generic berry aromas. The palate is racy and fairly hefty and tannic, with black raspberry, plum and mild herbal flavors. Grabby, with good acidity on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's a touch of ripe fruit followed by prune and dark tobacco. This Nero d'Avola is smooth and soft on the palate, with a touch of ripe fruit, plus notes of prune and dark tobacco. It would pair well with spicy chicken wings.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"Acacia, honeyed nut and yellow stone fruit aromas lead the nose. The medium-bodied palate shows surprising depth for the cool wet vintage, offering yellow apple, pear and bitter almond alongside zesty acidity. A mouthwatering saline note wraps up the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Vernaccia
"Red berry and spice aromas make up the bouquet on this limited-production wine. Herbal flavors of olive and berry finish oaky, blackened and minty.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"Semi-sweet and tasting like cherry-flavored cough medicine, this Merlot leaves a lot to be desired. But it's serviceable.",US-California-Merlot
"This attractively crisp wine is full of fruit with just a touch of caramel. Light, bright and very dry, it finishes with intense acidity.",France-Southwest France-Rosé
"Wood-aged wine that shows pedigree and style. It has red berry fruit flavors, firm tannins along with acidity and a dry core. It's a serious wine, for aging over 4–5 years.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Apple, pear and spice aromas lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors that manage to remain light on their feet. The finish seems a bit clipped but it still delivers enjoyment.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"The slightest hint of lemon zest on the nose leads into the light, crisp, dry palate. If it weren't for the friendly lemon notes, this would almost be neutral, but also clean. Slight spritz makes this slimline wine very easy to enjoy. Drink soon.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"Domaine Houchart is one of the top estates in Sainte-Victoire. This ripe while deliciously fruity and fresh wine is full of raspberries, ripe red currants and a refreshing line of acidity.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Soft notes of earth and gentle red fruit appear on the nose. The palate is very soft, smooth and centers on autumnal earthiness rather than fruit. Its pleasing backbone of freshness gives direction to the softness.",France-Alsace-Pinot Noir
"A barely-there glimpse of lemon bids you to step closer and take a sip. The palate unfolds in a still tightly contained bundle of lemon zest and juiciness. There is an undertow of riper texture, reminiscent of bitter orange zest and just as full of aromatic promise. This is wiry and slender but will mellow into seductive freshness and slick, almost cheeky tartness. With this concentration, it has all the makings of a flavor bomb and is something to really look forward to. Drink 2018–2030.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"Only 100 cases of this vintage-designated oloroso were made, and now it smells mature, nutty and oily. A full, elegant palate shows the right weight and acidic cut, while salty flavors of peanut and caramel finish long, nutty and a touch hot due to 22% abv.",Spain-Andalucia-Sherry
"Subdued red fruit is kept fresh by moderate acidity in this boldly dense and grippy wine rich in violet aromas. Soft, integrated oak adds a spiciness of black pepper and vanilla, while the overall experience is balanced and relatively lean.",US-California-Malbec
"Sugary-sweet and Porty, with high acidity and flavors of candied blackberries and cherries.",US-California-Malbec
"Saint Clair's Pioneer Block wines are always worth trying for their expressions of Marlborough's subregional characters. This one, from deep clay soils at the foot of the Dry Hills, features a bold cherry aroma and flavor, backed by ample vanilla and baking spice notes. It's big and slightly chunky in style, but it seems likely to smooth out over the next 12 months as the dusty tannins subside.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"Thank goodness this rosé is bone dry for a change, when so many California blushes are sugary sweet. It also shows a bite of acidity and tannins. The flavors range from mineral and rose petal to cherry and herb tea.",US-California-Rosé
"Creamy and powdery on the nose, with sweetness and leesy notes. The palate is round, smooth and not terribly cutting, while the flavors lean toward honey, melon and another shot of lees. Finishes long and classy, with elegance. Drink immediately before it loses its vitality.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"A Pinot Grigio that hits the mark on all counts. The aroma and flavors are apple and pear. The palate has a silky mouthfeel and good structure, with just the right amount of acidity, and a long finish. This is what more Pinot Grigios should taste like.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Airy and light on the nose, with citrus and tropical fruit aromas. Feels juicy, high in acidity and pointed, with tangy citrus flavors, particularly lime and lemon. Finishes tight, pithy and ultimately a touch bitter.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Chardonnay
"Juicy, fresh and lively, this is a light-bodied effort with a big presence on the palate in terms of rich mouthfeel and velvety tannin. Blueberry, cherry and a pronouncement of forest floor play well together to offer both savory and fruit-tinged sweet.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"An elegant expression of Tannat, with plum skin spice and a delicious juiciness showing well. The acidity, the wood and a smoky flavor add complexity. Age this balanced wine for another 2–3 years.",France-Southwest France-Tannat
"Dominated by Grenache, this rounded and full-bodied wine offers ripe red and white fruits. It is smoothly textured to give a wine that's attractive, elegant and for food. There is a light spice at the end, as well as acidity.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This smells basic and clean, with black fruit aromas of cherry and plum. It feels rugged, grabby and tannic, with a dark, chocolaty flavor of baked berry leading to a toasty and spicy finish that delivers strong tannin. It reflects the cool conditions of 2010.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This brut nature is citric and bubbly on the palate after opening with aromas of weeds and spring onion. Flavors of lemon, herbs, onion and mustard coalesce in front of a bitter finish.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"This wine was made from very specific Pinot Noir clones planted in a small block of the estate vineyard. It's exceptionally ripe with raspberry and cherry flavors, and plenty of new oak. A big wine, it's dark in color and impressive in weight, yet maintains a complex lightness of being. Drink now–2017.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This suave and sophisticated wine is so smooth to sip that its depth of flavor is a little deceptive. A subtle potpourri of clove, cinnamon, black tea and blackberry aromas swirl around a great core of mild acidity, fine-grained tannins and many layers of concentrated fruit flavor. The texture is velvety and the finish lingers for at least 30 seconds.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This could be classified as a red wine—it's as dark as some Pinot Noir. But the winery recommends chilling it, so we'll call it a blush. The blend is not disclosed. The flavors are rich with strawberries, persimmons and limes.",US-California-Red Blend
"Inviting aromas of vanilla, black-skinned berry and a touch of new leather come together on this full-bodied red. The concentrated, hearty palate delivers ripe blackberry, raspberry jam, coffee and tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2022.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"Off-dry, this succulent wine has you smacking your lips rather than puckering them. The natural acidity buoys up the sweet fruit, a mix of peach and apricot principally, and the wine has an excellent focused core that trails off into suggestions of honeycomb and lemon custard.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"First bottle corked. Second bottle sound, but rather one dimensional. The fruit is simple green apple and green berry; but there is a distinct earthy undertone that carries into the finish. If new oak barrels were used, they are not evident.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"This generous wine opens with aromas of ripe dark berry, ground pepper and graphite. The round, juicy palate offers mature black cherry, blackberry jam, menthol and licorice alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2021.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Lagrein
"A simple, rustic wine. It shows Pinot's silky texture, with racy acidity and subtle cherry, pomegranate and cola flavors. But it's chunky and clunky in the mouth. Seems to contain some unripe grapes.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Bone-dry although not shatteringly so, this is a crisp, tightly fruity wine. The aromatic character gives a fresh, green-apple-laden flavor reinforced by lemon zest. Drink now.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"This wine requires decanting, as it seems to have entered a dumb phase. But there is clearly a good core of blackberry and black cherry fruit, lightly dusted with fresh herb.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Menthol, new leather, white pepper, fig and forest floor are just some of the aromas you'll find on this fantastic wine. Smooth and structured, the full-bodied palate evokes dried cherry, licorice, baking spice, raspberry compote and a salty mineral note. Firm polished tannins provide smooth seamless support. Drink through 2031.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"The immediate impression is of savory umami aromas pierced with pine needle and sage highlights. Red and black licorice, along with sweet cured meats, bring complexity to fruit flavors of berry, cherry and plum. Toss in Provençal spices, coffee grounds and the classic Cayuse earthiness that continues through a deep, firm, beautifully defined finish. Drink now through 2030.",US-Oregon-Syrah
"Black plum, blue flower, oak, espresso and chocolate aromas waft from the glass of this densely structured wine. The palate delivers blueberry extract, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and spice alonside tightly packed wood tannins that generate an astringent, mouth-drying finish. Give it time to unwind. Drink 2018–2030.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"The oak—a mixture of new and used French and American—takes the lead on this wine, with aromas and flavors of vanilla, cocoa and coffee out in front of plum and dark fruit. There's a pleasing mixture of richness and lightness. The variety gets a bit subsumed but there's still much to enjoy.",US-Washington-Malbec
"Complex notes of bee pollen, saffron and caramel lend nuance to zesty apple and citrus peel aromas on this dry-style Riesling. It's a richly concentrated yet invigoratingly crisp wine marked by sun-kissed tangerine and lime flavors. The finish lingers long, accentuated by layers of crushed chalk and slate.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Lemon and apple aromas are basic, while the palate is spongey and offers only mild acidity to boost slightly mealy citrus and persimmon flavors. Finishes flat as a board.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Chardonnay
"Gravenstein apple, honeysuckle and jasmine aromas show on the relatively boisterous nose of this bottling from a large vineyard on Highway 46 east of Paso Robles. There is compellingly grippy texture to the sip, with ripe flavors of pear and honeydew melon. A salty acidity takes it to the next level.",US-California-Grenache Blanc
"Latex, tire rubber, sauciness, mocha and cotton candy all share the nose, while the palate is forward, a touch scratchy and filled with bold black cherry and plum flavors. Shows some toast and burn on the finish, and overall it's a good Malbec with some mild bite and abrasiveness.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Fresh apricot, melon and grapefruit abound from nose to finish in this brisk yet delectably fruity Riesling. It's dry and lithe in body yet penetrating and juicy. Zesty lime acidity lingers brightly on the finish.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Aged in oak, this blend of Chardonnay and Insolia offers bold aromas of white rose, honey and stone fruit, with a soft, round palate. The creamy finish would pair well with a crab cake or a spicy Thai mango salad.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"From the Alcamo area of western Sicily, this organically-farmed Nero d'Avola opens with slightly raw, vinous notes of cherry and fresh plum. The wine presents a bright, ruby color and offers flavors of toasted pistachio and spice on the close.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"This is an easy, gentle wine to drink now. It's softly tannic and dry, with cherry, red currant and cocoa flavors. Shows enough complexity to warrant pairing with an upscale steak.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"The blend is Syrah, Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon. The alcohol is very high, to the tune of 16% by volume. And the flavors are like Port, with incredibly rich chocolate and spicy red currants. This is a barbecue wine if ever there was one.",US-California-Red Blend
"Spicy on the nose, with dry, woody aromas and berry notes. The wine has a full, soft body and deep, basic flavors of black plum, baked berry and spice. Things darken on the finish, leaving chocolate and grapey thickness.",Chile-Maule Valley-Carmenère
"The Wallula vineyard, set high atop a bluff overlooking the Columbia river, gives grapes that bring dark, roasted flavors to the large-scale wine. The fruit tastes as if it has been pushed, perhaps a bit too far, and the impression it leaves tilts toward the raisiny side. It's a wine that could go in a positive direction with cellar time, but it is impossible to tell right now, as it cuts off quickly once in the mouth.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This has zest, personality and depth, with layers of red fruit, spice, leather, pipe tobacco and dried rosemary emerge that emerge on the bouquet.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"The very gentle but seductive notion of sun-ripened red-cheeked mirabelle plums radiates like sunshine from the glass. With a further sniff there also is peppery greenery: yarrow and hay. The palate also unites this friendly fruit with the savory spice of these herbs and comes in a light-footed, compact and fresh package that just dances on the tongue. This is deceptively frivolous Grüner with a seriously delicious concentrated core.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"A small-production Pinot that's earthy in just-picked strawberry, this offers light color and smooth, soft, silky tannins that have integrated well, though the wine remains young and fresh in the glass. It becomes weightier on the finish, expressing just the right amount of oak.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Deep garnet to the eye, this wine has a nose of strawberry and tart cherry with a hint of resin. Flavors of cherry, pomegranate, eucalyptus, anise and a soft touch of leather are suspended in a web of well-moderated tannins. Expect a lasting sense of coolness with a burst of brightness on the finish.",Israel-Galilee-Shiraz
"Redolent of mushrooms and forest-floor aromas, this barely hints at fruit, and what is there could be any thin, generic red wine.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A floral nose of violets offers an intriguing start to a wine that's both a value and a fun find. On the palate, red wild berry, spice and smoke are balanced, and though this has a rusticity that tells of its terroir, overall, it's simply pretty. Imported by Cape Wine Ventures, LLC.",South Africa-Western Cape-Shiraz
"Attractive aromas of fresh berry fruits are vital and announce a plump but punchy palate with toasty, blackened flavors of wild berries and lactic oak. A toasty finish stops just short of bitterness, while pouring on the power. Drink through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Pure Petit Verdot has a loyal following, and fans of the unadulterated varietal version will find this a spot-on example. Scents of violets overlay dark red and black fruit aromas; flavors follow with earthy tannins well-modulated through a medium-long finish.",US-Washington-Petit Verdot
"A peppery wine, all spice, nutmeg and black pepper. The tannins are tight, slightly green, but the juiciness is all there. Very fresh, very fruity.",Austria-Burgenland-Zweigelt
"With light touches of wood aging, this delicate, honeyed wine has all the poise and style of Jurançon, in the foothills of the Pyrénées mountains. Lightly stepping between freshness and rich, ripe, sweet fruitiness, the wine is full of apricot, sweet apple and lime acidity. It is delicious, but it would be a shame for the taste Sébastien and Isabelle Bordenave-Coustarret created not to age it, so drink from 2019.",France-Southwest France-Gros and Petit Manseng
"Along with the typical warmth of an Alentejo wine comes an earthy character that is less attractive. There are juicy rhubarb and redcurrant tones, but they are engulfed by its rustic character. Drink now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Crunchy fresh notes of red cherry dominate aromatically. The palate is light, juicy, crisp and very refreshing. This is rustic and ready, but also full of charm with its animating red fruit. The finish is dry and invigorating.",France-Alsace-Pinot Noir

"This wine is a blend of Riesling (70%) and Gewürztraminer. It brings aromas of pear, lychee and white flowers that are followed by an off-dry palate. It needs some more acidity to pull it all together.",US-Washington-White Blend
"Honey, jasmine, salted nectarine, yellow melon and plumeria flowers pop on the nose of this bottling that indicates Roussanne may do well in Temecula. There's solid yellow-grapefruit-pith grip to the palate, a touch of tart tangerine, slate minerality and some botanical elements. It's bright and tense for an often oily, easily over-ripened grape.",US-California-Roussanne
"Smooth and appealing, with ample fresh citrus flavors and a supple mouthfeel, this isn't so assertive that it gets in the way of the conversation or the food. Sourcing good quality grapes from non-premier regions keeps the price down.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"This wine is ripe and concentrated. It's packed with red fruit while also having solid tannins that give a firm structure. Acidity shoots through at the end to give a fresh lift, although the wine needs to age. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"With vineyards to the east of Saint-Émilion itself, this chateau has produced a structured, obviously wood-aged wine. It's a wine still in development, bursting with young black-currant and black-plum fruits as well as acidity. The wood is a strong background presence and will soften over the next few years. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Sensations of mature black plum are layered with notes of chocolate and roasted coffee bean. It's ripe, dense and evolved, with a markedly sweet finish. Drink now.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese

"Another solid showing from one of importer Fran Kysela's stable of Rhône producers. This offering shows plenty of rustic leathery aromas, along with a blend of cherries and blackberries. Not overripe or heavy; the fruit and tanned-hide notes come together in a velour-textured finish.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"For the price, this blend of five varieties is a pretty good value. It's oaky and full-bodied in blackberries and cherries, although a streak of green unripeness runs right down the middle.",US-California-Red Blend
"This perfumed wine discloses hints of apricots and white peaches as well as ripe lime juice. It is balanced, fruity with a good touch of minerality to give texture. The aftertaste is all about fresh fruits that will soften over the next few months. Produced by the Ducourt family, first in Bordeaux in 1858 and now one of the largest independent producers in the region. Philippe Ducourt handles the vineyards and Jérémy Ducourt makes this wine.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend

The texture is both smooth and crisp at the same time, and the long finish denotes quality.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Smooth and rich, this has creamy flavors of buttered toast, golden mango, Key lime pie and honey. Balancing all the sweet richness is fine acidity and a steely minerality. It's a bit dialed into the modern style, but there's no denying the opulent deliciousness of this Chardonnay.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The nose is rather shy but eventually reveals aromas suggesting wet underbrush, wild herb, new leather and a hint of woodland berry. The slender palate is rather raw and diluted, offering hints of tart sour cherry and star anise alongside brisk acidity and angular tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"White-peach aromas meet with vanilla butter and honeysuckle on the nose, yet there is a tension apparent amid the ripeness. The sip starts with an edgy texture and crisp acidity that cut across flavors of nectarine and apple.",US-California-Viognier
"This is a lovely vineyard-designate, floral and crisp in tangy grapefruit and tangerine. With plenty of complexity to its breadth and depth, it maintains effortless acidity throughout, finishing with just the right twist of lemon peel.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A compelling mix of cherry, plum and spicy aromas spell out Cabernet Sauvignon in block letters. This feels full, but also juicy, fresh and agile. Core berry flavors are lightly toasted and chocolaty, with coffee and lingering spice notes aiding a well-comported finish.",Argentina-Other-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A full six years old, this aromatic wine from Crawford Vineyard unfolds with baking spices, raspberries and cranberries along with a whiff of volatility. It's full bodied, sweet, rich and extracted with abundant red fruit flavors, sweet oak accents and a warm finish. The alcohol rides a bit high but overall the wine holds it well.",US-Washington-Syrah
"With its supple tannins and expansive mouthfeel, this wine has some real positives working for it, but there's also a definite clove and rubber edge to the aromas and the flavors show more leather and spice than fresh fruit. Turns crisp on the finish.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Sourced from the Teldeschi and Ramazzotti vineyards, with 12% Petite Sirah and 6% Carignane, this impressively bold, inky wine is undeniably pretty on the nose, recalling strawberries and cherries.

"From a handful of Napa Valley vineyards, this Cab is blended with Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot, producing a classically elegant wine dotted in cassis, cedar and white peppercorn. Chalky and buoyant in acidity, it drinks lean and supple, the finish darker in smoky, coffee tones.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This has somewhat acrid aromas of animal and farmyard, while the palate offers a very ripe plum flavor that's just short of being overripe, as well as vanilla and chocolate sensations. It finishes on a bitter note.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Light aromas of red fruit, game and vanilla are followed by quite tart puckering fruit flavors. It needs food to counteract the screaming acid.",US-Washington-Barbera
"There's a blanket of dusty-pollen over notions of underripe peach and green apple on the nose. The initial shock of citrus on the palate turns to juicy peach tones that ultimately turn sour. Bridging on the sweeter side of the dry category, this would be an easy quaff as an apéritif.",US-Michigan-Riesling
"Boasting one of the prettiest hot pink-meets-purple colors imaginable in wine, this offers aromas of freeze-dried strawberries, ripe raspberry and a bitter tinge of pink grapefruit and cranberry. The flavors reflect those aromas exactly, particularly the raspberry fruit.",US-California-Syrah
"A bit sweet and candied on the nose, palate and finish, but good if you like creamy, sweet, vanilla notes in your Cabernet. The feel is sort of soft and soupy, while flavors of candied, gummy red berry and prune maintain enough vitality to bring things home. A lot like a cherry-cola ice cream float.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A Cabernet with 12% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot blended in, all from Sonoma Valley's Rancho Salina Vineyard, this wine is medium in weight and viscous.

"Lots of new oak brings buttered toast flavors to this Chardonnay. Sur lees aging adds notes of sour cream. The underlying fruit veers toward intensely flavored green apples and limes. Tasted in January, the components haven't come together. Give it until the fall of 2013.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Bone dry and crisp, this Sauvignon Blanc shows fresh, savory flavors of lemons, limes and grapefruits, with richer notes of pineapples, vanilla bean and honeysuckle. A firm minerality helps add structure and finesse. It's a great restaurant wine, especially at this price, but will be hard to find, with only 140 cases produced.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Just a tad honeyed, but crisp acidity helps to provide balance. The apricot, tangerine, lime and vanilla flavors are easy to like.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

"Dark, inky extraction opens this Barolo and segues to bold aromas of mature berry fruit and spicy oak renderings. The wine feels plush, rich and generous in the mouth but the tightness and astringency of the tannins suggest that this wine will be ready in 5–10 years.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"Made in the traditional method, this is a blend of base wines from the 2011 and 2014 vintages.

The palate is slender, light footed and dry, the finish is whistle clean and wonderfully appetizing.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"A buttery aroma leads to rich butterscotch flavors and a buttery finish, too. But then there's more with each sip.

Made with certified Biodynamic grapes.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This young wine is packed with a mix of fruit flavors, including apple, pear, touches of citrus and other light tropical tastes.

"This inexpensive Chardonnay has a fair amount of oaky depth to it, unexpectedly since only 5% of it was aged in American oak, the rest in stainless steel. Nonetheless it has toasty vanilla flavors and aromas of lime, apple and cantaloupe and tastes refreshing and clean.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is soft, forward and fruity, with a somewhat flat mouthfeel. Soft, buttery oak rounds out into a smooth, silky finsh. Very seductive and caramel flavored, long, satiny finish. A drink-now bottle, not for aging.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Made in the winery's style, which is ripe, full-bodied and rustic. This one's extracted in jammy blackberries, plums and currants, with some raisins on the finish, which is dry and spicy.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Freshly pressed apples and pears are touched with honey on this juicy medium-sweet Riesling. Brisk, brash lemony acidity jolts the midpalate, extending to a sweet kiss of peach on the finish. Refreshing and quaffable.",US-New York-Riesling
"This impressive wine has a perfumed character, almost smelling and tasting of the wild garrigue and forest that makes up much of the La Bégude estate. It also holds a well-wrought tannic side, dark and solid, packed with black currant and berry fruits. It will age for many years and should not be drunk before 2019.",France-Provence-Provence red blend
"A perky little white wine, dry as dust, with lemon and lime flavors that are boosted by bright acidity. Spreads over the palate with a tart pepperiness, an ideal food wine. It's also a good value.",US-California-Fumé Blanc
"Unusual for Vinho Verde, this wine was aged in wood for nine months, resulting in a rich, full-bodied character. It's ripe, full of yellow fruits and crisp pear flavors, shot through with lemon acidity. What it potentially lacks in freshness it makes up for in intensity and depth of flavor. Drink from 2016.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Alvarinho
"The wine is all about fresh fruit. Blackberry fruit jumps from the glass with its light tannins and lively acidity. The structure, with just a touch of dryness, is just right to support the boisterous fruit. Drink from 2017.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"This wine is a blend Viognier (60%) and Roussanne. Aromas of almond butter, lees and spice are followed by a broad palate with a creamy feel. The finish lingers.",US-Washington-White Blend
"To get the best results, you'd better chill this one down. That way you'll get more of the refreshing apple and pear element of the wine and less of its fat, chunky body and rough, unpolished edges.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"This well-made wine has the classic fresh herb and gooseberry aromas, followed by tangy acidity and bright lemon and grapefruit flavors. It's a lively one: light, dry and well-balanced, not to mention very affordable.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This forward, full-bodied Rosso opens with aromas that recall resin, mature black plums, incense and spearmint. The one-dimensional palate delivers black cherry and vanilla alongside velvety tannins. It closes on a sugary-sweet note.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Extremely ripe and fragrant aromas of strawberry preserves smell quite quaffable on this decently priced wine. Flavors of raspberry, anise, rhubarb and clove-like spice are nicely rounded and finish up with smoky bacon fat elements.",US-California-Pinot Noir
Wheaty white-fruit aromas lack pop and clarity. This feels round and fairly juicy due to its acidity. Lime flavors are tempered by a bready yeasty note and fall off quietly on the finish.,Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of meat juices, peppercorn, underbrush and game lead the nose. The palate delivers dried cherry, prune, clove, grilled herb and anise. Tightly knit tannins lend support but still need to unwind. Drink 2017–2023.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Here's an interesting Brunello that recalls moist notes of forest floor and white mushroom, backed by cherry and wild berry. The wine opens with dense concentration and a dark ruby color. It ends with a long, polished feel.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
This wine comes from the heart of the Dão region. It is firm and dark with tannins and a concentrated texture. Fine acidity cuts through the black-fruit character. The wine is ready to drink.,Portugal-Dão-Portuguese Red
"There's a lot to like in this effort: ample dark fruit, complex notions of tea leaves and dried grasses, and a richly textured, long finish. The wine is medium bodied and not very tannic, making it easy to sip repeatedly. Drink it over the next 8–10 years.",Australia-Western Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is 100% Roussanne from Red Mountain, whose heat gives the grape plenty of ripening. Here it reaches into high-toned, tropical and candied citrus fruits, accented with pungent aromas of spun sugar, fruit candy and a whiff of diesel. Complex, forward, juicy and just a little hot in the finish.",US-Washington-Roussanne
"Tropical fruits, flowers and citrus lead this appetizing Chardonnay from Peconic. On the palate, the wine has some depth, with lemon/grapefruit citrus, pear and apple. A good everyday white.",US-New York-Chardonnay

"A powerhouse, but one that shows a certain degree of lushness to its robust blackberry and mint flavors. Finishes long and minerally, bolstered by slightly drying tannins. Should be more approachable by 2015 and last for three decades beyond that.",Portugal-Port-Port
"This Tavel rosé contains six grape varieties, although 80% of the blend is Grenache and Cinsault. Despite ample weight on the palate, the result is a bit chalky on the finish, with flavors of underripe berries and melon.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé

"In 2000, this was still the property of Lily Lacoste, who also owned Pétrus. Latour à Pomerol was sold  in 2001 to a Catholic charity. The management, then and now, is with the Moueix family who make the most of the fabulous vineyard. The 2000 is a hugely opulent, velvet textured wine, but it retains hints of the elegance that is the hallmark of this property.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Intensely floral, this opens with aromas that recall air freshener and lilies past their prime. The floral aromas carry over to the lean, rather diluted palate along with a note of candied nectarine zest.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Ribolla Gialla
"A rich, dry young Cabernet, with fresh blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, brightened by a burst of citrusy acidity. The tannins are strong, however, giving the wine a sandpapery astringency.

Black plum and dark spice notes are lightened with refreshing acidity on the finish. Age for five years and more.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Pomegranate, dark plum and slate show on the simple nose of this appellation blend. The palate is light, with hints of strawberry and plum as well as pencil lead and mace. It's a great option for chilling a bit and drinking on the beach.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"This ripe, perfumed wine is an opulent blend of Touriga Nacional with smaller proportions of Tinta Roriz and Alfrocheiro. It is juicy, ripe, concentrated and dense, with abundant black fruits.

"A spicy wine, with nutmeg and allspice as well as peppered plums. Against this exotic background, the tannins are solid and concentrated, suggesting good aging potential.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

Shows freshness along with simplicity, with finishing herbal notes of sage and tarragon. Contains 10% each Merlot and Cabernet.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend

"A pronounced jolt of backyard compost jumps out first in this wine, followed by thin layers of cranberry, quickly wrapped up before there's much to say about a finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"With some earthy aromas, this is a rich wine. It has weight, layers of wood and attractive strawberry flavor. The fruitiness is contained within a firm tannin shell that suggests the wine could age.",France-Alsace-Pinot Noir
"Cherry and plum aromas come with a dusty note, however things turn sharper and more brambly with airing. It feels citrusy and choppy, with sweet-and-sour flavors of raspberry and red plum. Juicy, but fiery on the finish.",Spain-Levante-Monastrell
"Wild red berries, crushed pepper, lilacs and a frame of asphalt show on the exuberant nose of this bottling. The palate is loaded with meat, smoke, cedar, charcoal and easy boysenberry flavors, the perfect pairing for a hamburger. It is a tad light in body, especially since it hasaged for so many years.",US-California-Merlot
"A full-figured cuvée from older vines, this wine is estate-grown, bottled and left unfiltered, a grand concoction of butter, baked pear and crème brûlée. Given almost two years in 50% new French oak, it's intended to offer richness and concentration, and does it well.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This unique blend of Chardonnay, Viognier and Marsanne by Bob Lindquist is priced to sell.

"Coconut oil, lime blossoms, fermenting citrus, kaffir lime and cold steel aromas show on the nose of this bottling of a grape rarely planted on the Central Coast. That coconut richness shows briefly on the sip, but it tightens up quickly to reveal restrained touches of lime skin and tangerine mousse.",US-California-Grüner Veltliner
"Sheer on the nose and palate with flavors of lemon and lime juice accented by hints of salted nuts and brine. These flavors are savory and clean, but could use a boost of concentration and depth.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Thick, soft and heavy, this Merlot has medicinal cherry and blackberry flavors.",US-California-Merlot

"Maduro cigars, cedar, beef char and pipe ash highlight the nose on this blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Cabernet Franc and 20% Merlot from a longtime producer. It's relatively lean and light on the palate, with black peppercorns and roasted pork elements. The Cab Franc shows strongly.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"A richly opulent blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon. It is rich, almost too rich due to its low acidity, but with some attractive melon, green plum and peach fruits. The spice from wood adds interest.",France-Southwest France-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This wine's new leather forest floor, menthol, pressed rose and exotic spice scents emerge in the glass. Full-bodied and focused, the palate delivers layers of cherry, pomegranate, crushed herb, licorice and cinnamon flavors. Bright acidity and youthful tannins provide balance and an ageworthy structure. Drink 2023–2038.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Supposedly Doña Paula's top selection for 2005, and while the wine shows some earthy darkness and plenty of fruit on the bouquet it doesn't follow up with the mouthfeel or overall balance that it should. It's ripe for sure, but also aggressive, with a disjointed acid-to-tannin ratio and an almost syrupy mouthfeel.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This full-bodied wine is complex and detailed from the spicy perfume to the finish, and rich and satisfying in the middle. Aromas like black tea and rhubarb lead to ripe and deep cherry and slightly tangy raspberry flavors that are lifted by moderate tannins and linger on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Leathery berry aromas are comported and spicy. This feels grabby, tannic and tight, but good. Blackberry, toasty oak and integrated spice and herbal notes conclude with a compact tannic grip and a lasting note of oak.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This is a wine that comes from a parcel of 15 acres, grown on pink granite rock. Vines that are 67 years old have given this firm wine its concentration and density. Generous, full of black fruits, the wine is developing although it needs more time. Drink from late 2017.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"A layered, somewhat delicate nose of rose petals, purple flowers, cola spice and raspberry-laced chocolate serves as the introduction to this bottling. Cherry, cranberry and raspberry emerge subtly on the sip, lifted by potpourri and sagebrush that fit into a chalky and tight structure. This will age very well.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Mourvèdre dominates the 2008 Lia, with Grenache, Counoise and Syrah filling in the rest. Fragrant and plummy, it's a mouth-filling Rhône-style blend, with smooth, lightly chocolaty tannins.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend

"This rosé is dry, crisp, tart and complex, offering raspberry, cherry, herb, white pepper and vanilla flavors.",US-California-Rosé

"Rich blackberry purée, blueberry jam, raspberry pie, cherry tart and cedar flavors in this Cab. Rather direct in its appeal, and a bit too sweet, but its solid New World style will appeal to some.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Reduced and green on the nose, with an overriding aroma of beet juice. Thick and almost cloying, with a jammy, stewy, stemmy set of flavors that finish herbal and green. Has darkness and weight but little more; 50% Tempranillo and 50% Garnacha.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Rich and modern, with dense extraction and raw notes of cherry, blackberry and spice, this wine is very representative of the new face of Barbera d'Alba. There are sweet fruit notes followed by equally sweet oak tones of cinnamon, chocolate and spice.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"Soft, lightweight wine, with gentle tannins and a thin fruit character. There is plenty of acidity to give freshness. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Here's a simple but genuine rendition of Brunello with measured aromas of cherry, wild berry and Indian spice. There's more personality in the mouth, however, where the wine shows a soft, supple and smooth texture.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Toast, plum, dark berry, ground pepper, tilled soil and coffee aromas come together in the glass. The chewy palate offers fleshy black cherry, juicy blackberry, licorice and tobacco alongside smooth, velvety tannins and bright acidity.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"Tasty, tart red berry flavors abound, from cranberries on up, with a suggestion of dried herbs. The finish turns a bit chalky.",US-Washington-Red Blend

"Forward and fruity, this offers flavors of berry and plum. It feels a little flat on the palate, with some peppery tannins and a quick fade.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Grassy floral aromas are aromatic but unrefined. This sparkling Chardonnay tastes of lime and wild flowers, with bitterness to the back end of the flavor profile. A sulfuric note of scrambled egg rises up on a bitter finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Sparkling Blend
"Among McCrea's Rhône-inspired white wines, this is the most complete and complex. It's rich and dense, with honeycomb, lychee, lemon rind, pineapple and lots of stone—lovely and lingering. It seems to gain strength as it rolls through a sensational finish.",US-Washington-White Blend

"This enjoyable wine's fruity black-skinned berry, violet and baking spice aromas leap out of the glass. The full-bodied palate doles out mouthfuls of juicy black cherry and ripe blackberry flavors alongside polished tannins and fresh acidity. Thanks to succulent fruit and freshness, the alcohol is seamlessly integrated.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"The character of this wine, a straight line of tannins and black currant fruit flavors, is the model of a classic Pauillac. It has all the structure as well as some austerity and severity at this stage in its development. But the fruit texture is rich enough, dried fruits and spice followed by licorice and bitter chocolate. Age for five years at least.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"In a sea of dense, dark-fruited Barossa Shiraz, it can be a refreshing change to find something with a little more elegance and high fruit tones, even if the aromas venture a slightly into soap territory.

"This opens with aromas of black-skinned fruit, soil and grilled porcini mushroom. The dense palate delivers black cherry, tobacco and mocha set against firm tannins and the heat of evident alcohol. Drink through 2020.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Definitely shows its Leyda roots via citric, oceanic aromas and flavors of crisp celery, bell pepper, grapefruit and mango. It's a bit softer on the palate than some coastal SBs out of Chile, but it's still full of verve and clarity. A very good wine that shows the Leyda style with Sauvignon Blanc.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, purple flower and a whiff of grilled herb float out of the glass. The chewy palate offers morello cherry and star anise alongside close-grained tannins and vibrant acidity.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Pure and soaring elderberry fruit with overtones of Morello cherry puts this in the darker fruit spectrum. Nonetheless, it has all the freshness and verve of red-fruited styles. This balanced and immensely enjoyable wine only reveals its seriousness slowly. Velvety texture and definite but gentle structure spell that this will also age well.",Austria-Burgenland-Red Blend
This is a creamy wine with soft fruitiness. The roundness is happily cut with acidity and with a citrus edge that lifts the melon and pear flavors. The aftertaste is tangy and zesty. Drink now.,France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

The sleek, easy palate doles juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and mocha alongside supple tannins and fresh acidity. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"Roasted, floral, candied aromas precede a zesty, medium-weight palate of red plum, cherry and herbal flavors. The palate is juicy and acidic, with racy red fruit and scour and scrape to the finish. Straightforward Carmenère without much softness or richness.",Chile-Central Valley-Carmenère

"A solid effort, in the mainstream style that you'll find on many restaurant-chain wine lists. Apricot jelly—not jam—flavors carry through all the way, with a clean, crisp, well-balanced finish. The residual sugar is just under 30 g/L.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Produced in the foothills of the Pyrenees mountains, this structured Tannat-based wine is dense and firm. Its tannins though are just the beginning, the entry point to the rich black fruits and concentrated texture. The wine, from a good vintage, is powerful, dense and needs to age. Drink from 2018.",France-Southwest France-Red Blend

"Zesty lime pith and lemon notes abound in this lively off-dry Riesling. It's feather-light in body yet radiant, offering loads of pristine tangerine and apricot flavors. It's juicy and approachable yet effortlessly elegant. A widely appealing sip to enjoy from now to 2021.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Generally considered the best of the best single vineyard Pinots from Sineann, this new Resonance is—to quote the late, great Robert Palmer—simply irresistible. Fresh fruit flavors of strawberry, raspberry, sweet cherry and more roll into a lingering aftermath with nuances of cinnamon, cola, chocolate, nougat, coconut and caramel. None of this is overwhelming; the fruit rules. But the finesse and length, which sneaks up on you, are impressive.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"With a soft mouthfeel and upfront cherry, blueberry and blackberry flavors, this Cabernet puts all its chips on sheer deliciousness. It's a winner, but not an ager. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

Sugary and bit cloying from start to finish, but good acidity keeps it in balance.",Spain-Northern Spain-White Blend

"This is a lovely wine to drink over the next 3–4 years, from one of Napa's masterful winemakers.

Give it an hour or two in the decanter before serving.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A severe edge of dried herb and savoriness in this single-vineyard Cab evolves into juicy black currant and cassis midway through. The tannins remain tightly wound and thick on the palate, before the wine finishes dry and concentrated.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Di Giovanna (an organic producer) shows a nice portfolio of easy-drinking white wines. This Grillo, for example, is redolent of passion fruit, lemon soda and vanilla cream.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Grillo
"All of the fruit for this wine comes from Catherine's Block at Dineen Vineyard. It shows bright fruit-forward aromas of blueberry pie, orange peel, flowers and smoked meat. The flavors are full yet show a sense of restraint, pulling up a bit on the finish.",US-Washington-Syrah

"This is gorgeous, structured and complex Cab: savory and Old World in style in some ways, revelatory in Napa richness and roundness in others. It conjures up visions of cherry crisp topped in vanilla gelato, with traces of smoke, dark chocolate and black pepper, the tannin integrated and persistent on the finish. This is a good choice for cellaring as well, through 2023.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Aromatic overtones of meadow flowers with just a touch of cotton candy hover over the lemony freshness. The palate balances mellow richness with taut acidity and creates a friendly tension between those poles. There is abundant apple fruit, both tart and sweet and a clean, dry finish that accentuates autolysis.",England-England-Sparkling Blend
"Underbrush, chopped aromatic herb, wild berry and a hint of new leather are the main scent notes.

Orange blossom and juicy peach figure on the nose and palate without the interference of oak or undue sweetness.",US-California-Grenache Blanc

"Too ripe and too oaky, and both attributes reinforce each other. The blackberry and currant fruit approaches Port in raisiny ripeness, while the oak accentuates the tannic sweetness.

"Nineteen months in 40% new French oak has left a strong mark on this wine, imparting it with notes of cedar, graham crackers, baking spices, toast and some drying, woody tannins. Cassis fruit backs up all those oaky sensations, but will likely remain a background player, so drink it while it retains a sense of freshness, now through 2025.",New Zealand-Hawke's Bay-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Light, lemony and crisp, this refreshing wine has some layers of complex herb midpalate and remains bright in acidity through the finish. From both the Miller Ranch in Yountville and Soda Creek Vineyard.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Soft, sweet and simple raspberry and oak flavors mark this rustic wine.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"While Argentine Malbecs aren't textbook cellaring wines, this one has enough spirit, tannin and structure to benefit from a few years on its side. Now, it's lush on the nose, with ripe berry, pencil eraser, vanilla and marzipan aromas. The palate is chewy but well built, with dense blackberry, cassis, coconut and chocolate flavors. On the finish, things only intensify. Will be at its best around 2015–2016.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A good Cabernet, rough and tannic, with blackberry and blueberry fruit flavors that finish a bit sweet and syrupy.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Light cassis and black currant aromas softly appear on the bouquet of this wine, with a touch of purple flower in the background for added interest. Low tannins and an approachable weight make this an easy-drinking selection that's ready for consumption now.",Israel-Galilee-Cabernet Sauvignon
"While the nose is focused on delicate lemon, apple and talc aromas, the juicy palate brings peach and crunchy red apple-skin flavors. Off dry in style, with vibrant acidity, this is a well-balanced offering from this northern Michigan producer.",US-Michigan-Riesling
"This is an unusual blend of Grenache and Pinot Noir, which are not often combined, neither in California nor in France. The winemaker is Jess Pisoni, and he has crafted a highly likeable blush. Pale in color and delicate in the mouth, it has ever-so-slightly lush flavors of orange tea, peaches and vanilla. The acidity is wonderful.",US-California-Rosé
"Pear, apple, hazelnut and crushed stone aromas unfold on this polished white. The aromas follow through to the full-bodied palate along with lemon drop and a tier of energizing mineral. Crisp acidity brightens the creamy flavors.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Bianco
"Terlato has mastered the art of crafting Bordeaux-style red wines that scream Napa Valley. The style is the modern one of exceptional ripeness, softness and sweetness, generously oaked and slightly high in alcohol. Here, you'll find deep flavors of blackberries, mocha, black currants, olives and toast. It's ready to drink now, and should develop in the bottle for at least 10 more years.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"There's something Alexander Valley-esque in the soft complexity of the tannins, and the slight herbaceousness that accompanies the black currants, cured tobacco and grilled meat. It's also a classic Petite Syrah, with that variety's inky black color and impenetrable tannins and dryness. This wine surely wants until 2020 in the cellar.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"This solid and powerful wine comes from a chateau right in the walls of Saint-Émilion. A dense texture brings out tannins and the wood-aging flavors. Spice, black currant fruitiness and a dark, dense character all promise aging. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Herb, wood spice, coffee and cherry aromas are followed by broad and generous black-fruit flavors. The tannins provide some grip and need time to settle in.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Opens with watery, citrusy aromas, and tastes of apples and grapefruits. Not much complexity or depth, but it's clean, with no flaws. On the soft side, and finishes with a little residual sugar.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Owned by the Cuvelier family of Léoville Poyferré in Saint-Julien and with Michel Rolland as consultant, this is a fine estate with an equally fine chateau. It is dense and richly endowed with black fruits and spice. At the same time, it has style and a way with its fruit and acidity that give it a lift. Drink this very ageworthy wine from 2023.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Made with Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon in equal parts, this opens with aromas of red berry, leather and tobacco. The juicy approachable palate doles out black cherry, vanilla, toast and graphite alongside fine-grained tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Structured and delicious, this opens with aromas suggesting underbrush, leather rose petal and a balsamic note. The juicy palate doles out raspberry compote, ripe red cherry, cinnamon and a sprinkling of white pepper. Firm velvety tannins provide the framework while a licorice note closes the lingering finish. Drink 2019–2025.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This Barolo from the Brunate cru shows gorgeous characteristics of mature fruit, spice, natural rubber, asphalt, tar and root beer. The wine's personality is marked by a comforting, almost familiar territory-driven feel that recalls the greatest Nebbiolo-based wines from Piedmont. Save this bottle in your cellar for 10 years or more.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"With its searing crisp character, this is a wine for food. Very textured, apple skins cut through the citrus acidity, creating a taut, nervy wine, although finishing with a richer, more yeasty character.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Quite grassy and brisk in style, this wine releases generous aromas of cut tennis ball, wet cement and sour limes. That citrusy acidity and sour-grass energy picks up lime pith, green-apple skins and a touch of white pepper on the palate, a very classic profile.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Not particularly varietal for a Chenin Blanc, but a pleasantly rich white wine to drink now. It's crisp in acidity, with sweet flavors of oranges, honey and vanilla.",US-California-Chenin Blanc
"Tight blueberry, hot blacktop and a flash of purple flowers combine for an earth-driven nose on this wine from a hot region in southern Monterey County. The flavors are quite distinctive, with barely ripe mulberries, cedar-edged blackberries, sandalwood shavings and a touch of graphite.",US-California-Tempranillo
"With brisk acidity and a tight, minerally feeling, this Pinot Noir is very dry, showing robust cherry flavors. It seems like an ager, but some raisiny overripeness might compromise it.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Appetizing notes of ripe Cox Orange Pippin apples, both in their fresh, crunchy state and in a more mellow baked version, characterize the flavors of this wine, with overtones of strawberry and sun-warmed stone. The juicy palate is concentrated and incredibly mouthwatering, with generous ripeness pitched against pure, zesty freshness. It offers concentration, liveliness and purity in one amazing package. Drink now until 2030 at least.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Mature dark-skinned berry, forest floor, truffle and chopped herb aromas unfold in the glass. The chewy palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry, licorice and an earthy hint of game alongside firm tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Melon, peach and tropical fruit aromas share the bouquet on this Malvasia-Xarello blend. A crisp, citrusy palate is lean, while tangerine, lime and melon flavors finish bright, with a moderate level of stony minerality.",Spain-Catalonia-White Blend
"This wine is still closed, lean and firm with its fruitiness masked by a strong mineral structure. It needs plenty of time to develop, so drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"With its inviting apple blossom aromas, this wine is fleshy and bright, showing balance and complexity from start to lengthy finish. Lemongrass, nutmeg and wild vanilla flavors tease in the background.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Although slightly off dry, it retains excellent tension and minerality. Pear, peach and pineapple fruit flavors combine in an elegant and long-lasting wine.",US-Washington-Riesling
"This wine has overlapping personalities. One drips richly in vanilla and honey, while the other is lemony tart and electric in acidity. They commingle on the finish, and will clearly decide whether to get along or part over time. Give the wine a good swirl.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This runs to the tart, lemony style of Pinot Gris, common in cool vintages. Citrus and gooseberry flavors are balanced against refreshing minerality, and the acidity is neither harsh nor simply sour.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Super-ripe wine that shows plenty of warm, aromatic Chardonnay fruits. White plums are balanced by intense spicy acidity with a more rounded core. The wine has a weight and richness that is cut by a grapefruit freshness. Screwcap.",Austria-Burgenland-Chardonnay
"Typical varietal aromas of wild berry and damp earth lift from the glass while the rather lean vibrant palate offers morello cherry, blackberry and star anise. Racy acidity and firm tightly packed tannins provide the backbone. Drink 2019–2026.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"With a fruity exuberance of crisp cranberry and red cherry, this wine delights in touches of nuanced herb and earth. Light bodied and refreshing, it maintains elegant complexity and depth, a lovely example of site and winemaking.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The winery's largest vineyard, Mount Richmond encompasses 105 acres, and yet just 752 cases of the vineyard-designated version were produced in this vintage. The demanding selection process worked wonders. This is a smoky and seductive wine with aromas of incense and Asian spice. Bright, ripe cherry fruit is highlighted with a dash of dark chocolate. Subtle and elegant, this is an all-star effort from a challenging vintage.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Light in color it's composed of violet and rose petal aromas, zippy in acidity, with layered dark cherry fruit and an earthy, herbal backbone. With texture on the palate, it has a buoyancy and electricity of minerality and finishes with the slightest suggestion of anise. Only 72 cases were made.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A slightly funky, earthy nose gives way here to a red that offers pepper, tobacco and a touch of tart cherry on the palate. The flavors and tannins are good and balanced, though the wine is simple.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
Smells like fruit juice. Overall it's raisiny and pruney. Drinkable but barely. Doesn't bring clarity or proper balance.,Spain-Central Spain-Tempranillo
"Dusty berry and plum aromas register as fresh but simple. This is similar on the palate: fresh and fruity, but not too serious. Flavors of plum and cherry are raw and drawing, while the finish sports supportive juicy acidity.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Red berry, dried rose, truffle and a hint of scorched earth aromas come together on this solid, no-frills Barolo. The straightforward palate delivers wild cherry, ripe strawberry and a hint of cake spice alongside firm, ripe tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2016–2021.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"Delicate but pretty aromas of violet, dark berry, brown spice and a whiff of sun-baked earth emerge in the glass. The firm, forward palate doles out ripe black cherry, licorice, mint, clove and tobacco alongside tightly knit but refined tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A light, ethereal quality ignites this wine's compelling high-toned acidity and subtle, integrated oak. Juicy orange and cranberry form its core, as roses permeate the nose. The texture is silky smooth and inviting.",US-California-Pinot Noir
This simple sparkler opens with fresh citrus and peach followed by bright acidity and smooth effervescence. Those easy-drinking and refreshing qualities make this Prosecco the perfect summer sipper.,Italy-Veneto-Glera

"An historic estate with an enviable winemaking past, Francesco Rinaldi is one of those wineries that sets the bar for everyone else. Its Cannubbio cru expression of Barolo shows deeply characteristic notes of wild berries, licorice and cola. The wine follows through to the palate with clarity, density and brightness. Drink after 2015.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Contrary to its name, this isn't exactly a 100-point wine, but it is ripe and full-flavored. Smooth on the palate and almost soft in texture, it's medium-bodied and very drinkable.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A nice Chardonnay to drink now, with rich tropical fruit, apple and pear flavors, enhanced with vanilla and smoky oak. One of the more successful Silverado Chardonnays of recent years.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Smells clean and mild, with peach and apple aromas. Rather foamy and rough feeling, with tangy flavors of stone fruits, green apple and pineapple. Light, juicy and fruity on the finish, but basic. Made from 100% Chardonnay using the Charmat method.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"This slowly reveals subdued aromas suggesting ripe black-skinned fruit, scorched soil, violet, dark spice and a hint of espresso. The palate is on the lean side, with a sprinkling of clove, white pepper and a coffee note adding interest to the core of dried black cherry. Dusty tannins grip the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Another sweet, oaky Chardonnay joins the ever-growing line. Not that it's an indifferent wine. This family produces nothing but impeccably tailored wines, and this one is among the best of class at this price point. —S.H.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This delicious Amarone has both structure and finesse. It offers a fragrance of pressed iris petals along with dark, ripe fruit and spice. The silky smooth palate delivers black cherry layered with cocoa, nutmeg and black pepper along with a hint of dried fig.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Too sweet and Porty. This mountain-grown Syrah has rich cherry-berry flavors and smooth tannins, but seems to have some residual sugar that makes it taste more like a dessert wine than a table wine.",US-California-Syrah
"This Pinot is all about fruit, which is both its strength and its limitation. Raspberries, strawberries, persimmons are there, alongside caramelized, buttery oak. The finish is tannic and dry. Drink by 2016, after decanting.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A wine with just the right Meursault opulence already the dominant character. The wine is fat, ripe, not losing sight of acidity or freshness, combining yellow fruits with a crisp, citrus final streak.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"A thoroughly honest effort, opening with lovely quince, apple and lemon fruit. The palate has a crisp lime edge and finishes with a kick of refreshing acidity. Drink now.",US-New York-Riesling
"Fresh and with a herbaceous background, this is a tight, taut and mineral wine. It presents a definite tang of lemon zest, steeliness and a crisp aftertaste. It can be drunk now, although it will be better from 2016.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of menthol, ripe berry, dark spice and a balsamic note lead the nose. On the straightforward palate, star anise accents dried cherry while firm tannins provide support.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This bodega always puts out a charred, roasted Carmenère, and this keeps the tradition going. Burnt, roasted aromas of coffee, campfire and blackberry lead to a full but angular feeling palate with vinegar-like acidity. Herbal, clipped flavors are mostly charred, while herbal black-fruit flavors vie with even more char on the finish.",Chile-Maule Valley-Carmenère
"This voluptuous, fleshy Shiraz seamlessly blends superripe berries with vanilla, coffee and cocoa notes. It's full-bodied, with a creamy texture that persists through the lengthy finish. Between the touch of warmth and ultrasoft tannins, smart consumers will want to drink this over the near term—now through 2015.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"While obviously not a “cult” wine, this full-bodied bottling has just what the varietal should offer in terms of ripe fruit, spice, a firm and moderately tannic texture, and a mouthfilling presence. Its strengths lie in good balance, tempting layers of flavor and a lingering finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Collin Cranor is a young, eager winemaker looking to make his mark in the Livermore Valley and this wine shows off his skill and ability to work with great fruit to make an interesting wine. Savory, this Petite Sirah has classic notes of chocolate, cherry and berry, though it benefits from a bit of air and time to open. Try it with meaty dishes; if they include bacon, all the better.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"This is a quiet, subtle and deliciously crafted white, moderate in acidity, that presents as crisp and dry. Meyer lemon shines brightest, providing a refreshing complexity as stony minerality adds texture.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Nutty in style, this classic wine shows the true intensity of dry Chenin Blanc. It's a wine with weight, concentration, toast, spice and an overpowering lemon and honey character. For long-term aging.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"At the age of more than eight years, this 100% Cabernet remains powerful with blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. It's just starting to show bottle complexity, with the tannins softening and the fruit gaining earthy tones. A criticism is the alcohol, which is high and doesn't seem to lose its heat. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
Floral cedary aromas and big berry-soaked flavors come together on a smooth but appropriately tannic texture as this full-bodied wine drenches the palate with blackberry and boysenberry richness. It combines power with complexity and has the grippy texture needed to carry all that ripeness. It was blended with 11% Petite Sirah and 5% Barbera.,US-California-Zinfandel
"Cherry and plum aromas are aggressive. This energetic Malbec is beyond snappy and juicy, while salty plum and currant flavors are racy and edgy. A briny aftertaste and peppery spice flavors dominate a tough finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This is the producer's proprietary Merlot-driven blend, the variety comprising 60% of the whole, with 30% Cabernet Franc and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. Like its other blends, it spent 21 months in French oak, 75% of it new. Sanguine in currant and plum, its thick structure holds richer notes of chocolate and coconut. Drink now through 2023.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"From the Oak Knoll District and estate-grown fruit, this 100% varietal wine has a substantial amount of vanilla and cherry at its heart. Medium bodied, structured and soft, it retains fine-grained tannins that should mellow in the cellar, through 2022.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is the first vintage of this blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc, named after the 16th-century abbess Rylint Formentini. Peppery in character, with rich, complex fruit, it has citric flavors, along with a sense of structure and acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend
"Slightly mealy apple aromas drive the nose. This wine is disjointed on the palate but contains lively citric acidity. Flavors of lemon, orange and briny gooseberry finish a touch bitter and tart.",Spain-Northern Spain-Viura
"More fruit forward than most Washington Cabs, it nonetheless has the structure and depth of pricier wines. Blackberry, black cherry, cassis and coffee swirl into a substantial finish. Tannins are tight and add just enough depth, while the riveting acidity and moderate alcohol make this more of a Bordeaux than a California style.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"William Church has outdone itself with this new Viognier, a mix of fruit from Conner Lee and Gamache Vineyards. A leesy, yeasty, textural underpinning complements the tangy lemon, lime, grapefruit and tangerine flavors. It's superfresh and delicious.",US-Washington-Viognier
"Lots of rich raspberry, cherry and cola flavors in this Pinot Noir. It has a delicate, silky texture and some true complexity, but is a little too soft to age. Drink up.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"An almost honeyed nose tells of the 2015 ripeness, but instead leads to a concentrated palate that intriguingly combines peppery spice, savory herbs and rich mellow yeast. All this richness is tempered by a streamlined lemony acidity. This is savory, so make sure to pair it with subtle, expressive food. What a joy.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"On the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge, the Celilo Vineyard is an exceptional site for Chardonnay. This was sourced from the 1983 planting, and the relatively old vines and cool vintage deliver a wine with excellent minerality, lift, drive and focus. The fruit is tangy and yellow/green, but perfectly ripe; the acid underpinning is fresh and lively. This has every chance of cellaring until 2024 or later.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"This young wine is already softening up around the tannic edges, and showing some early maturation of the plum and berry fruit flavors. A streak of mint and licorice runs into the finish, along with some not-quite-integrated oak tannins.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This mouthfilling red features lashings of oak, but the bountiful blackberry and blueberry fruit still shines, framed by notes of maple syrup and vanilla. The finish delivers a powerful finale of tannin, but the bold fruit powers through. Drink now–2015.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"There's a real clean and genuine quality that comes through thanks to aromas of peach, yellow fruit and Golden Delicious apple. It drinks well too—easy and forthcoming—and would make an excellent match to grilled chicken, spicy asian food or stay-at-home pasta.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Chardonnay
"This plump and fruit-driven Barbaresco offers nuances of ripe cherry and forest berry backed by lingering tones of licorice, vanilla, dark chocolate and clove. The wine is distinguished by a precise and focused mouthfeel that is shaped by acidity and firm tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"As you'd expect from this pioneering Oregon winery, this is a smooth, sophisticated, accessible yet ageable wine. Polished berry and cherry fruit is swathed in cola and cocoa highlights, running through silky tannins. Drink now through 2020.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"True to the variety, this pure expression of Syrah shows blueberry, cola, smoked bacon and milk chocolate aromas. The bouquet is a bit muddled compared to last vintage, but the wine is soft and smooth on the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Syrah

"Squeaky-fresh lemon and lime shine a spotlight against sweet melon and stone fruit flavors in this gossamer-textured spätlese. It's dancingly delicate, yet deeply penetrating on the palate, finishing on lingering notes of hazelnut and white flowers.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
This is an attractive blend of Braucol and Syrah which gives a ripe spicy wine. Red-berry flavors dominate with a rich texture and light acidity. The wine is perfumed and ready to drink.,France-Southwest France-Rosé
"With its ripe and perfumed character, the wine is not quite dry. It's already maturing, with its fruity acidity muted by almonds, ripe pear skins and a tight, mineral texture. This intense wine will be ready by 2015.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"This beautifully ripe and juicy wine adds a hint of menthol to the ripe black currant and black cherry aromas and delivers round, rich fruit impressions on the palate. It has a lush mouthfeel, mild tannins and a clean, fruity finish. Cabernet Franc makes up 40% of the blend, along with Petit Verdot, Malbec and Syrah.",US-California-Meritage
"A selection of the firm's best Vernaccia grapes, this offers delicate alluring scent of hawthorn and white stone fruit. The bright straightforward palate shows yellow apple and pear alongside fresh acidity while a bitter-almond note marks the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Vernaccia
"Red berry aromas and cherry and candied fruit are backed by spice, horsehide and tobacco. The mouthfeel is thinner, streamlined and still a bit raw.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Brawny, toasty aromas prop up a sturdy oaky nose with a familiar dark-berry core. This Malbec is tightly wound, with wiry acidity. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, spiced plum, chocolate and cardamom finish earthy and mellow, with a lingering note of exotic spice. Drink through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This wine from the one of the cool appellation's most historic and widely tapped vineyards offers savory aromas of blistered cherry tomatoes, paprika, marjoram, caraway and black pepper, with softer strawberry scents emerging over time. It's light and airy on the nicely flavored palate, with the Eastern European goulash elements prevailing over stewed plums and other cooked red fruits.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Fruity with black cherry and cassis, this includes 22% Lemberger; both grapes sourced from Kiona. It's peppery and herbal, with a slightly pickly character, likely from aging in 30% new American oak.",US-Washington-Malbec
"A soft and light-footed rosé, this offers notes of melon rind, tart cranberry and pithy citrus that are laced with an herbal overtone. Ample acidity helps to keep the palate fresh and the finish short yet clean.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rosé
"Nutty and dry, this Chardonnay-only sparkler tastes of almond paste, dried apple, dried citrus peel and toasty oak. It's vibrantly balanced and fulfilling.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A well-made Malbec that should please almost any fan of red wine. The nose is concentrated and full of black fruit, so it delivers what you'd expect. The mouthfeel is balanced, with medium weight and easy tannins. Black-fruit tastes of all types make for a solid flavor profile, and the finish offers mocha and cleansing acidity. A rock-solid wine for beef and pastas.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Franco Pacenti's brooding Brunello offers coffee, prune, ripe fruit and a thick, brownish color that all point to a ripe vintage. You'll get a distinctly sweet aroma of vanilla or maple syrup and the wine offers medium length on the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso

"Gorgeous from head to toe, this opens with cedar, maple, blackberry and the essence of schisty minerality. On the palate, it's tannic and firm but not overpowering. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, fig and vanilla finish with chocolaty notes and more than enough leftover berry fruit. Hold until 2017, then drink through 2024.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"There is as much intense acidity in this wine as sweetness. Opulent yet fresh in character, the wine is developing into a full-bodied wine with powerful richness and promises long-term aging. Drink from 2017.",Austria-Burgenland-White Blend
"Uriah is Spring Valley's Right Bank-style blend, with Merlot and Cabernet Franc sharing the lead. It's lively and fine-tuned, with a lovely mix of red fruits, spices, and fresh acidity. It spent 21 months in 65% new French oak, to good effect.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This Sonoma Coast Pinot is dry and simple, with raspberry, strawberry and oak flavors, accented with mouthwatering acidity. A bit of oak adds smoky complexity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Starts out rustic and leathery, with hints of smoke, leafiness and earth along with baked berry and spice. This four-grape wine has good density and mouthfeel that frames leather, earth and slightly baked berry fruit flavors. Finishes chocolaty and sweet, with just enough acidity to maintain balance.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"An unusually vivid gold color is the first indication that this medium-bodied wine will turn up the dials on flavor. Aromas resemble wood smoke, nutmeg, sandalwood and vanilla, while flavors are subtly fruity but largely oaky in the form of marzipan, toasted bread and other savory nuances. It is gorgeous in a voluptuous way.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Gritty, piercing aromas of herbal, leafy red fruits do little to set this wine on course. In the mouth, it's high-toned and acidic, and thus the flavors are tart, choppy and short.",Spain-Central Spain-Tempranillo
"Santa Rosalia is the quintessential pizza wine with bright fruit integrity and a touch of piquant spice on the close. The wine is fresh, firm and keeps the palate clean.",Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto
"The nose opens with a concentrated hit of ripe clementine peel, underneath this notions of mirabelle and pear shimmer. The palate is concentrated and full but appears much lighter—a combination of fresh acidity and an alluring touch of residual sweetness do their best to add a spring to the step of this unusual but captivating wine. Scintillating hints of mandarin peel, honeysuckle and kumquat make this incredibly moreish. The finish is off dry to medium sweet. Lovely now, but it's sure to last. Try with cheeses or spicy Asian dishes. Drink 2017–2027.",France-Alsace-Alsace white blend
"91-93 Barrel sample. Sweet, plummy wine, its tannins coming from spiced wood as much as fruit. There is a dry core, but the fruit is so opulent and ripe.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Subtle smoke hovers above earthy notes and the nose only holds the faintest suggestion of citrus. The palate comes forth with a vivid, leafy purity that suggests herbs, freshly turned earth and pure, lifted citrus. All we get right now are the flavors hovering above the core which is still firmly closed. A wealth of apple and citrus fruit is evoked which will awake with time, this is too young to be opened. Don't touch before 2018 and then drink until 2030 or even beyond. This is dry, delicate and yet powerful with a supremely clean finish.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"A green wine showing fruits that are underripe. While it has some soft flavors, red berries and simple tannins, that green underlay is a major downside.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Despite herbaceous aromas of eucalyptus and thyme, this choppy, grating blend of Carignan, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec offers forward bold plum and currant flavors along with can't-miss herbal notes. This is aggressive on the finish, with mild heat and raw tannins.",Chile-Central Valley-Red Blend
"This gorgeous wine from southern Italy shows the true potential of native grape Aglianico. It opens with an intense fragrance of black cherry, leather, truffle, underbrush and spice.

Drink through 2027.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico

"For this well-made, robust wine, the producer taps into multiple vineyard sources, including William Hill and Monte Rosso. Hung around a focused structure, it offers classic elements of dried herb, clove and graphite, with significant tannin that persists through a lengthy finish of toasty oak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A good, sound wine, but far from a success for the Artist Series. In fact it shows rustic tannins and the slightly sweet softness you might find in, say, a Paso Robles Cab. Disappointing.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

This is rather young but the fruit is very pure in crisp green-apple notes and fresh, tangy lemon. The palate is absolutely dry and very taut and fresh. Some yeasty notes also swing along on the palate. This certainly needs bottle age but promises to become a lemon-scented, fresh and linear marvel. It certainly has bags of tension and freshness.

Soft tannins and bright acid hold it together.",US-California-Red Blend
"The fruit is perfectly ripe and succulent, a juicy mix of berries and black cherries. It's set against firm but ripe and polished tannins, which provide muscle and add some spice as well.

"Hazy aromatics of sautéed apple and baking spice mark the nose, with notes of toasted nut and dill that surface on the palate. It feels full, round and supple, gaining some lift toward the close.",US-Virginia-White Blend
"The aromas bring immediate appeal, with notes of brown stems, herbs, crushed flowers, smoked meat and black pepper. The flavors don't disappoint, showing purity, focus and generosity with a spot-on sense of balance and a lengthy finish that kicks it up a notch. Give it time to open up.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Here's a beautiful interpretation from the 2008 vintage that shows balance, harmony and intensity all zipped up into one tight package. That seamless integration, followed by rich extraction, gives the wine momentum overall. Although this is a different wine from past vintages, the quality is just as high. Hold 5–10 years.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"A deep gold color sends up warning flags, and the flavors bear that out. Has simple apple flavors with a touch of shellac and no depth. Kosher.",Italy-Veneto-Pinot Grigio
"This powerful wine has considerable structure and considerable acidity that will shine as the wine develops. The fruit is delicious, showing great potential. Drink from 2020.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Enticing perfumed berry, violet, new leather and a truffle scents emerge in this textbook Brunello. On the savory, full-bodied palate, licorice, clove and chopped herb flavors accent a juicy core of ripe black cherry fruit. Firm, refined tannins provide structure. It's already tempting but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2020–2032.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Bready apple and spice aromas are layered, mildly complex and appealing. In the mouth, this is dry, leesy and tastes of toasted apple and nectarine. The finish hits the spot with proper weight, balance and lively acidity. Excellence in Cava may be fleeting, but this makes the grade.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Lovely green notes of lime zest and greengage rise from the glass in this wine. The palate is light, juicy and fresh, with a dry and zingy finish. Ready for a summer party.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"From delicate grapefruit to lychee and guava, fruit flavors gain concentration from nose to palate in this rich almost tropical Gewürztraminer. Bold and lusciously textured, it's slightly warming on the palate yet balanced, finishing with sizzles of spice and lemon-lime acidity. Drink now through 2020.",US-New York-Gewürztraminer
"On first take, this hefty Carmenère smells almost entirely of massive oak and related vanilla and maple, although airing calms things down. A dense, heavily oaked palate is extracted and full in body. Charred oak and coffee flavors cover blackberry and cassis notes, while this is flush on a huge finish.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"The winery's third vintage from this cooler-climate vineyard offers a mix of bright red cherry, wild, dried herb, rose and anise aromas rising to the fore. Lingering acidity keeps the firm tannins at bay—the two opposites finding a peaceful balance, allowing a freshness of citrus to succulently creep in on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The aromas bring high-toned, somewhat unusual notes of herbs, vanilla, toffee and tire rubber. The berry flavors are ripe, with nutty accents and a squeeze of tannins.",US-Washington-Tempranillo
"On the first pass the wine smells rubbery and minty, with a note of green herbs poking through. Gets jammier and fruitier with airing, and in the mouth it's blocky and resiny, with herb-infused flavors of berry and plum accented by lactic oak. Finishes sweet, muscular and sticky.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Typical passion fruit and gooseberry aromas turn tropical and almost rich on the palate. This is weightier than many Sauvignons, lushly ripe and maybe even a touch sweet—serve it well chilled for best effect.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Recognized for its good value, Saint-Romain is particularly strong on white wines. This wine, from old vines, shows some concentration and rich fruits that are balanced by toast flavors. It is a ripe wine with a strongly refreshing feel at the end.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Apple and citrusy aromas of lemon and lime are pure and clean. This feels crisp and citric, with zesty, tangy lime and tangerine flavors. In general, this is a simply presented Albariño, but one with class and clarity.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Fresh lime peel and kumquat aromas meet with lemongrass and a slightly yeasty touch on this bottling. Flavors are very tight and crisp, with citrus peel and wet riverstone. It's not an overly complex wine, but its freshness is compelling and lasts long once opened.",US-California-Chenin Blanc
"This leads with aromatic herb, wild berry and oak-driven spice notes. The tight, taut palate offers licorice, clove, baking spice, crushed sage and dried black cherry flavors but lacks fruit richness. It's framed by firm, close-grained tannins and vibrant acidity.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This wine is ripe, smooth and rich. It has a generous feel to it, although never far from the more mineral, steely, terroir-driven character that makes good Pouilly-Fuissé. The top of the range from Château de Fuissé, this wine is selected from 30 different parcels giving an harmonious balance between richness and structure. Age the wine and drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Rich black berry flavors lead in this delicious blend of 80% Montepulciano and 20% Sangiovese. The juicy fruit carries over to the palate, with notes of balsamic herbs alongside big, ripe tannins. It's a straightforward wine for everyday pleasure. Drink now.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"Very solid and deep, with a bouquet of delicious black-currant and dark-cherry fruit and toasty, buttery oak. Very comfortable mouthfeel. Full, with layered fruit and a long and elegant finish that sports big but not sharp tannins. Tight now; hold for three to six years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"You never quite know what you're getting with Barbera. Imagery's is absolutely dry and quite firm in dusty tannins, with a complex array of berry, herb, tobacco, cured meat and spice flavors. It's pretty much as sophisticated as California Barbera gets.",US-California-Barbera
"This wine is stylish, with layers of wood, black currant notes and a structure that will allow the juicy fruitiness to develop relatively quickly. It's balanced, with fruit, texture and acidity all coming together. Drink from 2016.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
Subdued baking spice and black-skinned fruit aromas mark the nose of this wine. The simple palate delivers blackberry and white pepper flavors and round tannins. Drink soon.,Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto

"Very ripe, soft and sugary sweet, this Cab has flavors of blackberries, cherries, mocha and caramelized oak. It doesn't really taste like the kind of tannic, ageworthy wine you expect from Diamond Mountain. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"One of the best unoaked Aussie Chardonnays I've come across, this is surprisingly full bodied and lush, boasting ample pineapple and peach fruit. If it lacks a bit of texture and complexity for not having any oak, the price more than compensates. Drink it over the next several months.",Australia-Western Australia-Chardonnay
"Soft, plush and bold, this is a modern and elegant wine. It opens with bright notes of cherry and blackberry, but also offers loads of toasted almond and dark chocolate on the close.",Italy-Southern Italy-Primitivo
"Blended with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this wine offers barrel-dominant aromas, with notes of coffee, vanilla and woodspice. The raspberry and cranberry flavors are quite ripe and luscious.",US-Washington-Sangiovese
"Tarry aromas of blackberry and freshly applied asphalt set up a full-bodied palate with sandpaper tannins. Blackberry and toast flavors taste a little burnt, while an oak-based blackened element is present on a stout finish. Drink this blocky and lusty Malbec through 2023.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Honeysuckle scents and flavors of pear, papaya and cucumber lead into a fresh and delicate wine, with plenty of acid behind the crisp fruit.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Clean and fresh, this features largely neutral, mineral-driven aromas that hint at white fruit and melon. Citrus, particularly white grapefruit, is the lead flavor, while background notes of pith, melon and green banana make appearances. Fresh, crisp and nice on the finish.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Composed on the nose, this has a berry aroma and a controlled herbal-olive scent. It feels solid and round, with berry and herb flavors. The finish shows a hint of oak and chocolate.",Chile-Curicó Valley-Carmenère
"This is richly concentrated and dense, showing an inky dark color with blackberry, leather and cured meat notes. A soft chocolate tone appears on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This juicy blend of Gewürztraminer and Riesling sports a lush mix of melon, citrus, orange peel and grapefruit, with spicy highlights.",US-Washington-White Blend
"This is the casual sipper of the Château de Nages rosé pair, offering slightly briny, fumé notes on the nose, but following them up with peach and melon fruit flavors that finish long, crisp and dry.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"Some years ago, Willamette Valley Vineyards purchased the Tualatin Estate vineyards and winery founded by Bill Fuller in 1973. To mark the return of Mr. Fuller to winemaking, the new cuvée celebrates his 40th vintage. A tawny gold, it's scented with honeycomb and pineapple. Potent and focused, it carries those flavors into a finish rich with bee pollen and preserved lemon intensity.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"There are some exquisite flavors in this Cab Franc: cassis, cherries, raspberries, cocoa, smoky oak and a rich array of dusty crushed brown spices. The wine is fully dry, with finely meshed tannins, but the main quibble is that it's too soft to be completely balanced.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Made with 60% Sangiovese, 30% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with delicate aromas of black-skinned fruit and a whiff of baking spice. The no-frills palate shows mature red plum, toast and a hint of bell pepper alongside rather astringent tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Complex fruit flavors that are focused and intricate bring a lot of life to this medium-bodied, lively and intriguing wine. There are touches of ripe apple, honey, mango and an underlying light layer of vanilla and cream, all supported by fresh acidity and a smooth but slightly tangy texture.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Produced by the Baron family, this nonvintage blend is soft and as balanced as the other wines in the range. It has a ripe feel to it, creamed apple and green plums giving the fruity element. Drink this attractive wine now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"The winery's grand statement of the year, this blend of 73% Cabernet Sauvignon and 27% Cabernet Franc is sourced from several vineyards, including the Tonella site in Rutherford, Stagecoach atop Atlas Peak and Frediani Vineyard in Calistoga. Thick, rich and dusty, it exudes Rutherford's magical dust, followed by chocolate and black licorice, just a trace of fennel on the lengthy finish.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Offering one of the more creative gimmicks yet, this bottle comes with a small pencil to decorate the mostly blank front label. The wine inside conveys aromas of lemon rinds, light peach and salt that give way to flavors of pineapple, apple blossom, yellow pears, sea salt and appropriate tanginess.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A wonderful bouquet, like that of a well-aged wine, helps this spicy, fruity bottling stand out. It has gorgeous floral, tamarind and cola aromas, generous fruity flavors and a smooth, lightly tannic texture. An unusual and delicious twist on the variety.",US-California-Barbera
"Blueberry and boysenberry aromas blend with graham cracker and cardamon scents to give off an exotic nose. In the mouth, this is hard, narrow and tannic, with a grating overall feel and earthy, baked, limited flavors of blackberry and toast. A long, tannic finish is choppy in feel and monotone in flavor.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A delicious Syrah in the classic mold of Columbia Valley fruit. Solid and sappy, it's a mouthful of bright berry flavors, penetrating into layers of licorice, coffee and chocolate. The liquorous finish is rich and balanced, with a hint of heat.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Chocolate, espresso, plum and black currant are backed by smoky nuances and natural rubber. This muscular wine offers polished tannins and firm structure to the end. A bit of wine from the 2005 and 2006 vintages is blended in.",Italy-Southern Italy-Red Blend
"Close to the Listrac vineyards and with the same ownership as Cap Léon Veyrin, this estate is on some of the same limestone soil as that appellation. The wine is structured and tight with firm tannins. The 55% of Merlot does suggest a juicy character although this will take time to develop and fill out. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The Grand Estates Merlot holds center court in the vast Columbia Crest portfolio. This new release, which has received extra bottle age, is seamless, smoky, supple and seductive. Exotic sandalwood and Asian spices weave from the nose into the palate, wrapped around broad black cherry and blackberry fruit flavors. A darker streak of black olive and licorice runs into a finish replete with tannins that are tight and hint at stem.",US-Washington-Merlot
"This was the last vintage at Clos Fourtet under the ownership of the Lurtons. They made fine wine, but the potential of the property was never quite realized. The wine just fails to excite: it is rich and concentrated with ripe tannins and some sweetness, but at the same time, there is a layer of acidity and structure which gives the wine a firm, solid shape.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a beautifully ripe, smooth wine. The wood aging adds a touch of vanilla to what is rich blend of Aragonez, Trincadeira and Touriga Nacional. Black berry fruits, rich tannins and just the right amount of acidity make a wine that will be ready to drink in the medium-term. Drink from 2016.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Fruity, ripe and round, this is simple Chardonnay that gives pleasure from its warm texture and softness. The apple flavor leads to a gentle finish.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"Slightly sour orange-cranberry aromas meet with a touch of sagebrush on this wine from an increasingly popular vineyard at the eastern edge of the Sta. Rita Hills. The even-keeled, very drinkable flavors surround tongue-tantalizing spice, light red fruit and a little caramel on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Stalky aromas infiltrate schisty plum and berry scents, while in the mouth this Garnacha-led blend of five grapes is jammy feeling. Stalky, roasted berry flavors are strong, while the finish is stalky tasting and gritty in feel.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"This puckering, tannic and brawny wine has a lot of body and a shyness of fruit, lingering in clove and tobacco.",US-California-Merlot
"Sumptuous and hedonistic, this perfumed single-vineyard bottling shines a spotlight on luscious grapefruit, guava and pineapple flavors. It's decadently fruity, but crisp acidity and a delicate crushed-mineral undertone keep it fresh and invigorating.",US-New York-Riesling
"Features pleasant but slightly simple flavors of candied cherries and cedar, with a smooth mouthfeel and just a hint of tannin on the finish. Drink now. Imported by Walca International.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"With 100% Touriga Nacional, this is a finely perfumed, ripe yet elegant wine. The wood aging still shows in the spice and vanilla, although this will certainly diminish as the wine ages further. This small production wine just needs a few more months and will be ready from 2018.",Portugal-Dão-Touriga Nacional
"The question is how much oak can you handle? If you like a heavily toasted, resiny type of full-bodied Chardonnay, add two or three points. If you absolutely hate that style, then subtract a few points. For those of us in between, look for resiny, toasty, heavy aromas on top of a thick, chewy palate full of baked apple and tons of wood spice. One-dimensional but well made.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"Even Carrick's entry-level wine has turned out well in 2013, offering a sturdy, robust mouthful of dark fruit. Plum, espresso and dark chocolate mingle on the nose and palate, while the finish is long, faintly dusty and mouthwatering. Drink 2017–2025.",New Zealand-Central Otago-Pinot Noir
"From the winery's most pebbly five-acre section of vineyard atop Diamond Mountain, this is dark black-purple in color. The tannins are soft but powerful, eager to age through 2025–2027, while the fruit lies on the currant and plum side of things, with a bit of cedar lurking through.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A pinch of hard tannins gives this bone-dry young wine an astringent toughness. It shows very fine, concentrated black-cherry, cocoa and crème de cassis flavors. Aging in almost 100% new French oak adds notes of toast that the fruit easily tolerates. Nearly all Merlot, it's a wine of considerable volume, but nowhere near ready to drink. Give it at least six years in a proper cellar, and it could be one of the rare Merlot-based California wines capable of extended aging.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Slightly foxy on the nose, with rubbery aromas of cherry and cassis, this offers a tight, tannic palate with hard, elastic tannins. Flavors of cherry and cassis are pleasant, while the finish is ripe, warming and healthy.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This smells oaky and tastes ripe and pure, like crushed blackberries and raspberries. It feels plush and smooth in the mouth, finishing on the soft side. While medium bodied, it has just a touch of tannin to balance the ripeness and make it appetizing to drink.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A blend of predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with 10% Cabernet Franc, this opens with black-skinned berry, scorched earth and cooking spice aromas. The concentrated palate delivers black currant, mocha and licorice flavors with a hint of black pepper, all set against a backdrop of fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2021.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"From selected parcels of the Ollières estate, this wine is impressive. It has weight but that is balanced by the acidity and the generous black fruits and acidity. This is certainly a wine that has been well aged, although it would pay to wait another year before drinking. So drink this very fine wine from 2018.",France-Provence-Provence red blend
"The highlight of a thin lineup, Cave B's Sauvignon Blanc brings tart fruit flavors of lemon and lime, grapefruit and melon. Thankfully, no oak was applied; this winery has a heavy hand with barrels. This new bottling is young enough to retain the crispness and liveliness of the natural fruit.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"Spicy, smoky oak aromas dominate this dark-colored and full-bodied wine. Cherry and raspberry emerge as the flavors. The texture is plush but not quite soft, as firm tannins and moderate acidity give it good structure.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A juiciness of cherry and vanilla spark the opening of this wine, a celebration of the vintage, appellation and in this case, fruit-forwardness of the variety. With a backbone of oak and cedar, it has smooth tannins and medium weight, finishing in mocha chocolate. Drink now through 2022.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Excellent concentration impresses here, with a full-throttle mix of citrus, apple, pear and peach fruit. Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this spent five months on the lees and offers length and balance.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris

"From the far north of the Vinho Verde region, the rich and creamy wine balances acidity, green plum and crisp minerality. Aromatic, elegant, fresh.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White
"This is a ripe year, but this vineyard designation isn't quite as tropical as their Côte Sud. It's more of a precise style, but there are also some hints of grass, onion and herb. Interesting, but very slightly off.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"96–98. Barrel sample. This is a structured, ripe wine that also has a great sense of freshness—vibrant blackberry flavor and lively acidity. The finish retains the same delicious freshness and brightness of this vintage.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Composed and not the least bit pushy or punishing on the bouquet, this has gorgeous berry and spice aromas. It feels a bit racy and high in acidity, but that will only serve the wine well in the long run. Plum and boysenberry flavors lead to a racy, high-acid finish. Drink now–2020.",Spain-Levante-Monastrell
"This young wine needs some time in the cellar. Released at the age of two years, it's mouthwatering in acidity with fresh, juicy cranberry, raspberry jam and persimmon flavors that finish spicy and long. The alcohol is refreshingly low, adding to the delicate mouthfeel. Drink 2017 and beyond.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Two fistfuls of Merlot help soften this wine, along with 5% Petit Verdot. These grapes contribute to the full-bodied spirit and youthful tannin make-up that becomes plush and lush as it goes, revealing sizable elements of mocha, black currant and vanilla-tinged oak. Drink now through 2020.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A nice Cabernet to drink now. It has very ripe, upfront cherry and blackberry pie flavors, with firm tannins and a sweet vanilla note.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Rarely do you come across something like this: mature and complex Malbec from Cafayate. Earthy aromas of plum, prune, raisin and tobacco give this an Old World bouquet. Saturated but with enough acidity to maintain balance, this tastes rooty, chocolaty and earthy, with mocha, toast and toffee flavors on a heady finish. Drink now.",Argentina-Other-Malbec
"Beefy aromas and flavors complement ample blackberry and cranberry notes in this firm-textured, well-balanced and nicely layered wine that's based on Zinfandel and Syrah. It's concentrated without being too full bodied, with good length on the finish.",US-California-Red Blend
"This beautiful wine is austere at this very young stage. But what pent-up power—the richness comes from glorious ripe fruit, tempered with a core of steel and wrapped with pure lemon, apricot and toast flavors. Age for 10 years at least.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A delicious Pinot Noir. Set it beside more expensive bottlings and it stands up well. Silky and rich, with raspberry and cherry purée, cola, sweet vanilla and sandalwood flavors, and a long, spicy finish. Production was 26,000 cases.",US-California-Pinot Noir
Brisk red-apple flavors govern nose and the crisp palate. A lemon backbone of freshness brightens everything. The finish is clean and appetizing.,France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"Smells like corn stalks and also of oxidation. The palate is wet but shapeless, and the flavors are waxy and jumbled. It's yet another pass-it-by, underperforming Mendoza Chardonnay.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"89-91 Barrel sample. Fresh and juicy, this wine exudes blackcurrant juice flavors, the wood a background hint. It is has an attractive light touch, with fine final berry tastes.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Bold and red on the nose, with only mild herbal aromas. That slight herbal character extends to the palate, where red plum and red currant flavors take over. With adequate size and plenty of fuel in the tank, this is no wallflower of a wine. But it is a bit limited and tangy, and the acidity seems amplified.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"Dilute red fruits and a tomato paste flavor are the story here, with no varietal character. Some earthy, roasted barrel flavors come up but are not well-integrated.",US-Washington-Syrah
"A raisiny and ultraripe Bordeaux-style blend, two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon. It has apparently been given a lot of time in heavily-toasted barrels, and the layers of smoke, espresso, cinnamon and tobacco dominate. A wine for those who like the blockbuster, oaky style.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a serious, structured wine with a great future. It has weight, tarry black tannins and dense berry fruits. Spice, toast and ripe fruitiness are all melding well together, although they need time. This complex, concentrated wine will be ready to drink from 2018.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Barolo Colarej is characterized by dark concentration, powdery tannins and bright aromas of forest fruit, cola and exotic spice. The wine presents a compact, streamlined style with a blast of fruit intensity on the finish. Pair this beautiful wine with game hen and black truffle.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"The wine is structured with firm tannins as well as ripe fruit. Juicy and concentrated, it has a spicy character that comes from the wood aging. In the Mayé Eymery family since 1854, the wine is from six parcels on the estate. Give this fresh as well as rich wine until 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is quite rich and complex, and while it's not without flaws, it shows tremendous promise for future vintages. The wine is dry and full-bodied, with ripe blackberry, smoky leather, dark chocolate and white pepper flavors. But the best thing is the tannic structure, so fine and dusty, almost Napa-esque in quality.",US-California-Syrah
"Fermented in 100% stainless steel, this priced-to-sell Syrah has some red fruit and violet character. On the finish it tastes slightly burnt.",US-California-Syrah
"The nose on this basic Sauvignon is likeable, with moderate citric bite and zing. It's smooth and tasty in the mouth, with lime, tangerine, passion fruit and minerality. A cleansing, smooth finish confirms the wine's quality. It says a lot for the potential of Chilean SB.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"With its superripe aromas of honey, melon and spice, this is a mouthfilling, sweet wine. It's round, without any sharp edges, yet maintains German Riesling's unique minerality and cut on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2020.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"While it certainly has bright acidity and green fruit flavors, this is quite creamy in texture for an Aligoté, its angles softened and rounded. The finale is fresh, with a more citrus character.",France-Burgundy-Aligoté
"This lovely blend of Sangiovese (60%), Cabernet Sauvignon and Canaiolo shows the super Tuscan side of a storied wine region like Montalcino. Indeed, Castello Romitorio is one of the best Brunello producers and this wine shows their expertise with other grape varieties. Blackberry, soft spice and fruity fullness characterize the mouthfeel.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Perfumed in dried herb and cigar, this is a supple, round, high-toned wine, made from largely Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Dolcetto. Red cherry dominates, almost like a kirsch, while the restrained oak makes it easy to enjoy now.",US-California-Red Blend
"Hovey's Petite offers mountainous tannins that are still soft and structured, mellowed by the bright red raspberry and blackberry fruit encased in baking spice.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Truffle, new leather, coconut and spiced plum aromas come together in the glass. The taut, full-bodied palate delivers mature black cherry, licorice, coffee and ground pepper set against a backdrop of fine-grained tannins that give it a firm texture. Drink 2019–2027.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Reuling is humming its way toward continued greatness in working with its own coveted fruit, crafting a coming-together of earthy fruit and lush texture.

"This is a southern Rhône-style blend, with a fruit mix falling on the not-quite-ripe end of the spectrum. Tomato leaf and rhubarb flavors run into chewy tannins and a quick, short finish.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Blended from undisclosed grape varieties, this wine offers a myriad of citrus fruit, peach, vanilla and honey flavors.",US-California-White Blend
"This is a curious but successful blend of basically equal parts Zinfandel, Malbec and Tannat. Rich aromas of blackberry and blueberry meet with pine, cigar box and wet rocks on the nose. The berry fruit that shows first on the sip is elevated by a woody backbone and lifted with crushed clove.",US-California-Red Blend

It is finely structured with yellow fruits just supported by the toastiness. Drink the wine now.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"The northernmost Beaujolais cru of Saint-Amour is also the smallest, giving wines that are structured like this.

The wine will be ready to drink from late 2017.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Bergevin Lane's wines show a rich mix of herbal and earth flavors, with ripe but not overly sweet fruit. This 100% varietal Syrah is herbaceous and aromatic, with rich scents that mix the purple fruits with intimations of herb, chocolate and cracker. It's elegant and tight, and should be decanted for several hours. Once it breathes open, it's perfectly balanced and drinkable right now.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This solidly good block selection shows shy aromas of dark red and purple fruit with a touch of earth and asphalt. The palate is tart and tight, with a bit of sagebrush nuance.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Expressive and bright, this has raw fruit and cherry aromas followed by touches of barbecue and teriyaki. The mouthfeel is plush, rich and slightly chewy, and the tight tannins need a few more years to soften.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Made with southern Italy's most noble white grape, this structured wine conveys subtle aromas of white and yellow spring flowers accented by whiffs of beeswax and slate. The juicy palate delivers white peach, cantaloupe, pink grapefruit and mineral alongside fresh acidity.",Italy-Southern Italy-Greco
"This assertive wine is one of the few rosés made from this bold grape variety. It has a medium red coppper color and vivid, tart cherry and rhubarb flavors. Meaty, spicy accents emerge on the finish, so it will add a little drama to any meal.",US-California-Rosé
"Certainly denser and richer than the regular bottling. Still, it is not a lot to get excited about. Berry-cherry flavors are well-oaked and framed in silky tannins. Feels easy and slippery in the mouth, but lacks the depth you want, especially at this price.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This blend of 64% Cabernet Sauvignon and 36% Merlot is focused on cedar, crushed dried herbs and cracked, hot blacktop aromas, but also shows blueberry and boysenberry fruit on the nose. The savory palate coincides, with pencil lead, dried sagebrush and juniper, oregano and thyme and the ever-so-slight hint of dried New Mexico chile.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Fat red cherries and red plums are laid across slate and star anise on the nose of this bottling based on a historic clone. There is solid tension to the sip, with rocky, grippy minerality framing hibiscus, pomegranate and chaparral flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Raisiny aromas are accompanied by a chocolate note on the nose. This Garnacha is rough and punchy on the palate, with tart currant and plum flavors that run counter to the nose. Prior to an abrasive but energetic finish, this tastes herbal and oaky.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"This dry wine has a medium-dark color with a mahogany rim. It offers strong berry, black pepper and clove aromas and flavors, and a broad, smooth texture. It's full bodied, mouthfilling and spicy.",US-California-Grenache
"Only the second released vintage of this wine for Felton Road, and already the improvement is noticeable. The black cherry fruit is bold, the vanilla-laced oak assertive, and the overall impression is one of power rather than nuance. Maybe that will come with age.",New Zealand-Central Otago-Pinot Noir
"It's important to not drink this Merlot right out of the bottle, because it's pretty tannic, and thus it's hard to appreciate the wine's beautiful fruit. Give it some time in a decanter to reveal the complex flavors of blackberry, cherry jam, grilled prosciutto, cassis, red licorice, cola and spice. It's unclear if this will age for a long time, but it can certainly be enjoyed over the next five years.",US-California-Merlot
"A very fine value in a Cabernet that's dry, balanced and shows real Napa character. With firm tannins, it shows delicious black currant, mocha and oak flavors. Easily as good as Cabs twice as expensive.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made in a cooler, lighter-bodied style, this wine appeals with cedar and wild strawberry, integrating the oak and letting the tannins mellow in the background.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Made with organically grown grapes, this is a nicely textured Vernaccia with a supple, creamy feel and vibrant tones of stone fruit, melon and honey. Pair it with Indian food or fish.",Italy-Tuscany-Vernaccia
"Grown sustainably on land between the Santa Lucia Highlands and Carmel, this great-smelling wine shows light caramel apple and sea salt on the nose. There's a judicious touch of butter to the palate, where flavors of green pear and lemon zest leave the mouth watering with acidity long into the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Some lovely red wines are coming from the Montecucco wine region (located in coastal Tuscany) and Collemassari leads the pack of this new and exciting group of vintners. Soft cherry, leather, spice, and earthy mineral tones create harmony and momentum.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Not as successful as the winery's Cabernet, this Merlot is very dry and tannic, with only modest blackberry fruit flavors, but it has a certain elegance. Turns oaky and herbal on the finish. Probably best soon.",US-California-Merlot
"This medium-bodied wine smells sweet but tastes dry. Vivid fruit aromas and flavors, and a lively, tangy mouthfeel add lots of personality. It smells like apples and honey and tastes like crisp apples and citrus.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"Initially, this smells heavy, earthy, nutty and even a bit raisiny. In the mouth, this is chunky and rich, with pounding tannins. The flavor profile is much like a chocolate parfait, with sweet, nutty, spicy notes. On the finish, copious oak is reflected via clove, mint and wood-spice flavors. Drink this lush, sticky Carmenère through 2021.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"This blend of 60% Gamay, 28% Cabernet Franc and 12% Pinot Noir, sourced from widely separate vineyards throughout Oregon, is a surprising success. The flavors are ripe, recalling sweet mulberry and blackberry, and the polished tannins wrap it up nicely. Drink up.",US-Oregon-Red Blend
"Closed up and just hinting at its great potential, this wine is showing tannins and a dry, solid core. Slowly it reveals delicious, opulent red berry fruits and concentrated texture. It needs a lot of time before drinking; wait until 2019.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"The aromas pop on this 100% varietal, with notes of dark plum, mountain blueberry, vanilla and cream. The flavors are smooth and sultry, mixing fruit and barrel with a plush feel and a lightly astringent finish. The variety is hard to get but it delivers a lot of enjoyment.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"A nice, racy version, with lots of citrus and strawberry fruit that linger nicely on the finish. Crisp and light; a good match with grilled seafood. Drink now.",US-New York-Rosé
"Pale in color, this is a light-tasting wine. It does have just enough fruit to give some red-fruit flavors. Everything though is light—a crisp reflection of the light of Saint-Tropez. Drink now.",France-Provence-Rosé
This light-bodied wine is quite dry and nervy with acidity. Its fresh red cherry and cranberry flavors follow floral and black cherry aromas. Smoky-earthy complexity adds interest to its elegant personality.,US-California-Mourvèdre
"With a toasty character, this is a classic of its kind, with ripe fruit and an attractive slice of lemon. A mineral edge to this spicy wine gives a fresh texture at the end. It should age a few months, so drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Apple, citrus, floral and bread crust aromas lead the way on this savory wine. The bright dry palate presents lime, toasted hazelnut, pear and a hint of spice alongside fresh acidity.",Italy-Lombardy-Sparkling Blend
"A nicely textured if somewhat oaky Pinot Noir, with cherry fruit that just sufficient to support the plush coating of vanilla and cedar. Long and layered but oaky on the finish. Drink now and over the next couple of years.",Australia-Victoria-Pinot Noir
"This interesting blend holds 67% Grenache and 33% Tempranillo, although the results are a tad thin and reedy, with dried berries, hay, smoke and allspice aromas. The palate is relatively light, with oregano and cherry flavors.",US-California-Red Blend
"Aromas of black-skinned fruit, baking spice and mocha lead the nose while the ripe palate offers black plum, vanilla and tobacco. Assertive tannins and the heat of evident alcohol provide the framework. Drink through 2019.",Italy-Central Italy-Sangiovese
"The estate vineyard is in Calistoga, and the wine shows gorgeously ripe flavors but never loses its basic Napa elegance and balance. Filled with flamboyant blackberry jam, cherry, cassis, licorice, chocolate and smoky vanilla-oak flavors, it appeals immediately to the tastebuds, but has the tannin-acid balance to age for a decade.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Best known for their red Bordeaux blend, Rubicon also produces small quantities of this Syrah, grown on the Rutherford estate. The wine is spectacular and immensely satisfying. Thoroughly dry, its tannins are front and center, but they are very finely ground, and frame enormously complex flavors of cassis, cherry jam, grilled meat, sweet leather, lavender, crushed pepper, smoky vanilla and cinnamon spice. Drink this fabulous wine now and through 2010.",US-California-Syrah
"One of the ultimate expressions of Etna, San Lorenzo is an elegant, determined and sophisticated wine with a steady stream of delicate aromas—wild berry, crushed granite, smoke and cola—that build in momentum and evolve beautifully over time. The mouthfeel is firm and structured, with polished tannins and a bright berry endnote.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nerello Mascalese
"Firmer and more tannic than many Hawke's Bay Syrahs, this is nonetheless classy, with gentle cracked-pepper notes and ripe blueberries upfront, followed by layers of blackberries, black olives and spice. The lingering finish features bright berries underscored by coffee grounds. Drink 2018–2025.",New Zealand-Hawke's Bay-Syrah
"Light red cherry, dried sage, black tea and thyme show on the nose of this bottling from the iconic facility in the heart of its namesake valley. There is a lot of action on the palate, where tart cherry and plum skin flavors meet with dried mint and earthy shrub elements.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is dilute to the point of being thin, showing pale flavors of apple and underripe peach. A plastic note runs through it also. Tasted twice with consistent results.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Almost a repeat of the ‘05, in which the oak dominated everything else. Those waves of caramel and buttered toast taste good, and together with the pineapples and pears, give the wine an exotic taste of some creamy, spicy, honey-rich mashed fruit pudding.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Coming from one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine starts out quite aromatically closed up, with notes of brambly blue fruit and herbs, along with whiffs of orange peel and smoked meat. The flavors, in contrast, pop with electric notes of dark plum and huckleberry and lingering undercurrents of smoked meat and orange rind. Give it some time to open up and it delivers.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Shows off the reasons why Dry Creek has achieved a good reputation for this finicky variety, Merlot. The wine isn't made big, gooey Napa-style. Instead, there's an herbal earthiness to the cherry-berry fruit, and the dry tannins suggest pairing with rich fare.",US-California-Merlot
"A solid, well-made Sauvignon Blanc from RockBare that combines aromas of melon rind and underripe nectarine with flavors of stone fruit and citrus, this is a nice wine, albeit not one that solves the mystery of what Austin Powers was missing in The Spy Who Shagged Me.",Australia-South Australia-Sauvignon Blanc
"This blend of 44% Shiraz, 34% Merlot and 22% Cabernet Sauvignon boasts dense notes of black berry, cherry and raspberry on the nose and mouth, with soft hints of game, char and roasted cocoa nib. The mouthfeel is lush but lifted, with medium acidity and structured tannins that lend grip to the finish.",Israel-Judean Hills-Red Blend
"There's a disagreeable sharpness and harshness to this Merlot. Despite some pleasant cherry, berry and oak flavors and a lush texture, that rough tartness persists through the finish.",US-California-Merlot
"This is a straightforward, clean, fruity wine, with a green apple flavor.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Fresh blueberry, burned caramel, black licorice and sage scents show on the nose of this bottling of a variety that doesn't often get its own stage. The tannins are light but ever-present, framing black plum, elderberry, thyme and peppercorn flavors. It's not as rich or dense as similar wines but is nevertheless a nice sipper.",US-California-Petit Verdot
"White peach and spice notes billow aromatically in this soft, creamy textured wine. There is attractive acidity along with a touch of honey that softens and rounds out the acidity. It's ready to drink, although it will age well in the bottle.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"With sweet-and-sour cherry and blackberry flavors, this Cabernet tastes a bit like menthol cherry candy. It's a straightforward wine, but good for burgers and everyday fare.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a rich cru wine with red-plum flavors as well as tannins that are still young and forceful. Densely textured, the wine has plenty of potential. It will become a ripe and fruity wine while also remaining firm and structured. Drink from 2018.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This cloudy, unfiltered Sauvignon Blanc charts new territory for Argentina. Ripe flavors of peach, pear and melon turn more bitter on the finish, which isn't long due to modest acidity.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Sauvignon Blanc
"Oak plays a major role in this bottling from the owners' Mateo Vineyard, somewhat masking the variety's characteristically peppery hints, but it's lavish and delicious. Blueberry, blackcurrant, cocoa and warm pastry notes hit the nose, and the extremely smooth palate unleashes blackberry pie, dark-chocolate fudge and cappuccino flavors, without being sweet.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Expressive, not expensive, this has an appetizing mixture of spice, herb and smoke aromas, plenty of blackberry and raspberry flavors, and a soothing texture. It smells like black pepper, dried thyme and wood smoke, then turns more fruity in the mouth. It is medium bodied and slightly soft in balance.",US-California-Zinfandel
"With the exact same rating as the awesome 2004, this new vintage of Aurus is an unbridled winner. It's a little creamy and sweet on first blush, but time and air reveals its darker, more serious side. Flavors of blackberry, barbecued beef and fudge tell all you need to know about ripeness and richness, and among the new classics of Rioja, Aurus is one of the leaders. Drink now and over the next three years. It's not really for long-term cellaring.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Lush and round, floral and fruity, this only hints at residual sugar. The acidity makes for a bracing palate that offers highlights of clover and honeysuckle, plus rich notes of stone fruits.",US-Washington-Gewürztraminer
"Baked and heavy, this has prune, raisin and jammy berry aromas. The weightiness carries onto the palate, which is chewy and smooth. Flavors of blackberry, spice and jammy syrup lead to a finish with a chocolaty tone. Tasted twice, with consistent results.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"The nose blends overtly floral, fruity lead aromas with secondary notes of shoe polish and leather, but in the end it's a little mute. The mouth offers standard plum and berry flavors, while the mouthfeel is chunky and generally quite pure. This is not a thoroughbred, but it's more than a good plow horse.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Hailing from the cool 2010 vintage, the notes of coffee, olive and cherry here are light and sweet, backed by dry, chalky tannins.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"D'Arenberg's The Coppermine Road is always structured—sometimes to excess—but the 2009 vintage seems to have the requisite flesh to age successfully. Cedar, chocolate and cassis notes surround a firm core of dusty tannins. Drink from 2015–2025, and possibly beyond.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"From vines planted in 1955, this is a ripe, fruit-packed and mineral-driven wine. It has succulent green fruits, laced with lemon zest and firmly textured. It needs to age for several years to reveal its full potential. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Lovely delineation here, the berry/cherry fruit framed with coffee and chocolate from a 50/50 mix of French and American oak barrels. The surprise is the addition (via co-fermentation) of 6% Viognier, which stabilizes color and gives a pleasing, floral/citrus lift to the scents and flavors. Good balance and follow through.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Powered by intense botrytis, this wine is opulent and ripe, with spice, yellow fruit and honey flavors. It has just the right balance of acidity to maintain its shape and proportions. It's likely to age well over many years. Drink from 2024.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Suave and interesting on the nose, this bottling packs in a lot of magic. Pepper, blueberry, violet cake, dust, Sichuan peppercorn and chipped slate show on the nose. Finely grained tannins provide a chalky texture, while a rising acidity presents flavors of elderberry, underripe blueberry, tobacco and powerful florality in this great varietal expression.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"This smells forced and grapy, with murky undertones. Flabby on the palate, this organic red tastes nutty and earthy. An aftertaste of mulch and peanut is off base and highly questionable.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Carmenère
"This wine has rich Meyer lemon, lime, fig, date, green apple and spice flavors that are brightened by crisp acidity. But the sugary finish is too sweet.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This new vintage is sourced from a single block from the Dineen vineyard, and aged in 50% new French oak—the most ever. Black fruits abound, along with licorice, tar and a whiff of iodine. It's a tightly wound Syrah, with the stuffing and style to age for a decade or longer.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Aromas include black berries, coffee, espresso and grilled Mediterranean herbs. The one-dimensional palate lacks the essential fruit richness needed to support the bracing, astringent tannins that give a drying, bitter character. It also displays evident alcohol sensations despite the modest alcohol.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This especially ripe and deep style of Barbera grown at the Miraflores property looks quite dark, smells like dried fruit and tastes rich and full-bodied. It has admirable concentration, a smooth and layered texture and good length on the finish.",US-California-Barbera
"A wonderfully tender hint of Damask rose swirls into the nose, followed by a smoky, grounding earthiness. The palate plays with that rose flavor and adds a touch of peach and tangy citrus zest. The palate stays on the off-dry site and focuses on zesty spice and a wonderfully textured phenolic edge. It masters a wonderful high-wire act between richness and zesty vigor. The wine is beautiful, full-flavored and exciting with a long just-off-dry finish. Drink 2017–2027.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"A tantalizing  wine, at once rigid and austere, then yielding and generous. It's pale in color, with earthy smells of sun-warmed red brick, dust and an elusive hint of black cherry. Remarkably light in the mouth, like air, with silky tannins. Firm acids scream out for Italian food. —S.H.",US-California-Sangiovese
"This is an attractive, ripe red-fruited wine that is showing its best already. Soft tannins, juicy red berries and a light shot of acidity all come together easily and freshly. Drink now. Screwcap.",Austria-Burgenland-Zweigelt
"A really nice wine, refreshing and light, with delicate lemon-grapefruit flavors complexed with creamy lees. The acidity is very crisp and assertive. No discernible oak at all, and with this pretty fruit and structure, it doesn't need any.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Estate-grown and aged patiently for 30 months in American oak, this is a beautifully-balanced, medium-bodied wine. It has the kind of grip on the palate that's great with rich foods and a very agreeable cherry-berry fruit flavor. The tannin component is firm and the acidity is lively, so each sip cleans the mouth for another bite of food.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This pink sweet sparkling wine opens with sweet notes of raspberry, vanilla cream, cinnamon and a touch of white pepper. The smooth mouthfeel is supported by fizzy effervescence. Incrocio Manzoni 13.0.25 was created in the 1930's by Italian professor Luigi Mazoni and is a cross between Raboso del Piave and Moscato d'Amburgo grapes.",Italy-Veneto-Sparkling Blend
"This zesty dry Furmint leads the way with aromas of lemon juice and freshly cut pineapple. It has delightful flavors of apple, peach and Bartlett pear with a nice amount of heft on the palate. There's a great deal of minerality and the finish is creamy and brisk at the same time.",Hungary-Tokaj-Furmint
"Named after King Henri IV, this is a powerful, ripe and still-structured wine. Big, rich tannins push the structure forward and boost the full black-plum flavors. It is complex, dense and still needing time. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot opens with aromas of cherry liqueur and cassis, followed by accents of leather and toasted nut. The palate is tight and fresh, and it offers touches of citrus and forest fruit.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"From vines close to the Czech border, this wine is soft and yeasty in character, with juicy fruit, a ripe texture, citrus and bell pepper flavors. Age for 2-3 years.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner

"Aromas of tomato sauce and fresh green herbs set up true-to-Carmenère flavors of salty, herbal plum and berry. On the finish, typical varietal flavors of olive, herbs and spice are saucy.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Carmenère
"Herbal and fruity all at once with clean aromas of gooseberry, hard mango and green grass. Ctirus flavors dominate the lightweight mouth with crisp lime acidity charging through on the close.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Sauvignon Blanc
"A Cabernet Sauvignon that includes 8% Merlot, Silver Palm is dense and oaky, with round tannins and a big taste of cherry followed by a strong herbal and menthol component. Fairly priced, it's ready to be paired with rib roast.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is the kind of wine someone serves at a big party, maybe in paper cups, along with the canapes, and you're delighted because it's actually pretty good. It's dry, soft and chocolaty, with a rich undertow of blackberries and currants.",US-California-Syrah
"Not a cookie-cutter wine, this tastes very alive and exuberant. It offers an aroma like fresh-baked scones, with very tangy flavors like orange and pineapple. That also makes it lively in texture, with lots of bright acidity derived from the grapes. Slightly nutty nuances develop on the finish, which is exceptionally long. It's a rare wine that has no added sulfites.",US-California-Chardonnay
"“Bolle,” which is Italian for “bubbles,” plays up its cheerful and playful side with bright aromas of citrus, peach, passion fruit and green apple. It washes down easily thanks to the wine's natural acidity.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"D'Arenberg is better known for its red wines, but this promising effort from the Adelaide Hills is one to watch. Vanilla and custardy notes mark the nose, while the flavors turn toasty and cereal-like, backed by plenty of mixed citrus fruit. It's not overly rich or ripe, but has long, mouthwatering finish.",Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"A captivating Pinot Noir, soft, lush and sensual. It seduces the palate with appealing raspberry, cherry, currant, chocolate, anise and spice flavors that are so delicious. Equally likeable for the silky, easy texture. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Smoky, toasted oak aromas lead to strong char and butter flavors and a viscous texture that clings to the palate. Subtlety is not one of this wine's virtues, as its outsized flavors stand in stark relief.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This blend of Merlot, Syrah, Petit Sirah and Primitivo is aromatic and fruit-filled, with notes of confection, blueberry pie, plum, licorice and red fruit. The flavors are sweet, primary and direct with a smooth feel.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This rosé boasts slightly meaty aromas, plus a healthy dose of limes and berries. Feels big in the mouth and slightly soft, so maybe it's not totally dry, or maybe it's just an oversized rosé with relatively low acidity. Either way, it'll go down just fine this summer.",US-California-Shiraz
"Collin Cranor remains one of Livermore's most promising young winemakers and this wine proves the point, a blend from three vineyard sites. This has a very pretty raspberry nose and is well-balanced throughout, with blackberry, oak and black tea flavors giving it an intensity of purpose. Will age well over the next couple of years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"All biodynamically raised estate fruit comprises this marvelous Viognier, which spent four months in 40% new French oak. The full-bodied, perfect ripeness mixes apple, pear and apricot, with a gentle kiss of caramel from the short-term barrel aging. The length and balance set the standard for top-flight domestic Viognier.",US-Oregon-Viognier
"This opens with sweet aromas of red berry, vanilla, toasted hazelnut and white pepper. It has a feminine touch, with endnotes of blue flower and red currant. Drink after 2018.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Now completely mature, this is a toasty, while fragrant wine, rounded and rich. It brings out the warmth of the vintage without losing the right acidity and flavor intensity. It is now completely ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"There's an intensely rustic earthiness to this wine, complemented by white pepper and nutmeg. Medium bodied, it also offers sizzling acidity and tart red cherry. Lithe, it builds toward a robust, ripe end. Cellar through 2017–2020 or give it a few swirls before enjoying.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A taut, mineral wine with a domiNAce of Chardonnay to give the crispest citrus and a very textured feel. Definitely dry, the wine, not from a classic vintage year, seems still young and all fruit, so it would be worth aging for 3–4 years.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Intriguing notes of sandalwood and cedar meet with dark red fruit and a touch of black pepper on the nose of this wine. The palate is layered with interesting touches of sage, marjoram, gravel and tar, hints of black cherry and loamy earth, and a chalky mouthfeel.",US-California-Merlot

"There's something almost Grenache-like in the flavors here, which are focused, youthful and packed with ripe red fruits. It's tart and well-tempered, and lingers gracefully. Hints of orange peel lead into an impression of orange liqueur, framing the supple tannins. Drink now through 2025.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This has lots of bright red-cherry flavor, plus plenty of zingy Monterey acidity. The result is a clean, straightforward wine offering juicy drinking pleasure.",US-California-Cabernet Franc

"Easy to drink, this has enough sophistication to pair with rich scallop, tuna and lobster dishes. It's dry, although there's a lot of sweetly ripe orange, apricot and buttercream flavors, as well as caramelized oak. Brisk acidity fortunately brings a crisp, balanced edge.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Six months in French oak lend a rounded feel and delicate spice to pressed apple and lemon flavors in this wine. While less forward and fruity in style than most New York Sauvignon Blanc, its richer body and slightly salty, saline palate are enticing.",US-New York-Sauvignon Blanc
"A blend of Baga and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a powerful wine. Densely tannic and firmly dry, it is also rich and structured. The acidity from the black currant fruitiness shows strongly. It is not a shy wine, all guns blazing. It is a shame about the heavy bottle. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Bairrada-Portuguese Red

"A big, boldly powerful but elegant Zinfandel, full-bodied in the mouth and dry, offering waves of ripe fruits and spices.

Drink over the next six years.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Classically crafted, this impressive wine opens with alluring Nebbiolo aromas of mature dark berry, pine forest, leather, aromatic herb, baking spice and an earthy whiff of game.

"Noticeable oak-driven notes of toasted nuts take center stage and are embellished by delicate tones of stone fruit, chestnut honey and yellow flower.

Only 200 cases produced. Drink through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec

"This wine starts on the shy side but with several minutes in glass reveals delicate notes of lemon-lime, watermelon rind and grass along with a touch of butter in the background. It's the palate that's of real interest here. Prickly acidity is backed up with a chalky texture, a hint of spice, and a long lemony finish. This is a light and refreshing drop, with a hint of seriousness thrown in for good measure.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"While perfumed on the nose with aromas of rose petal and peach, a vein of green lingers throughout this blend of Muscat and Malvasia. It's dry and medium bodied in style, but delicately concentrated with soft, yielding acidity.",US-New York-White Blend
"Merlot heavily dominates this Right Bank-style wine, with Cabernet Sauvignon accounting for only 11% of the blend.

It's an easy-drinking wine, with some aspirations to complexity.",US-California-Meritage
"This is a powerful wine with complex structure, dense fruits and a solid texture. It's dry, firm, dark and still very young. The core of the wine is still tannin, the black cherry fruit giving so much richness before the fresh acidity cuts in. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir

Attractively perfumed this ripe wine has hints of the crisp acidity that is also there. It's a fresh wine with the potential of richness. Ripe pink grapefruit and tangy acidity are balanced by the warmer flavors of pear and quince. Drink from late 2015.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Super-fruity, with jammy flavors of pineapples, green apples, peaches and spicy golden mango. A bit sugary sweet, too.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Can Paso Robles grow Pinot Noir? This wine suggests yes, at least in the cooler Willow Creek and Templeton Gap zones. This offers aromas of graphite, pomegranate and plums, followed by a palate that blends dark purple fruits with eucalyptus-like herbals. This will be even better with some time in bottle.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Plum and cherry aromas are generic in nature. This feels jammy and candied, while heavy berry fruit and oak flavors combine to keep things basic and muddled.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"Cherry, leather, tobacco, licorice and chocolate-dipped strawberries combine into a heady nose on this single-vineyard bottling from the Grenache-focused winery. Tongue-tingling acidity runs through flavors of balsamic vinegar and strawberry extract, all held together by steady tannins. It's quite a full presentation of the grape.",US-California-Grenache
"All types of tea, from black to nettle to Greek mountain to chamomile, show on this wine's herbally powered nose, with bits of sagebrush and wild berries thrown in for good measure. Tea elements also power the palate, along with cranberry fruit and raspberry leaf, held together with grippy tannins, at least for this grape",US-California-Pinot Noir
"It's impressive what a small addition of Sauvignon Gris and Muscadelle can do to a Sauvignon-Sémillon blend—it turns this into an exotic wine, with spice and lychee flavors.",France-Southwest France-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Of all the Beaujolais crus, Morgon is the one for aging. This wine, with its powerful structure, exemplifies age-worthiness. It is weighty and dense, with a solid feel, plus juicy, opulent fruit that helps to balance the wine. Keep for 3–4 years.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"A full, fruity, slightly hot Chardonnay. The barrel aging—all French, 60% new—brings the expected toastiness. This is a solidly made, fruit-forward style, immediately ready for drinking.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"The producer blends 57% Chardonnay from the Maldonado Vineyard with 39% Sauvignon Blanc and 4% Viognier for this fresh, floral white. On the palate, apple and lemon flavors are buttressed by a core of laser-like acidity. A fresh pear note lasts long into the finish, proving the wine's ability to be both creamy and crisp.",US-California-White Blend
"Vibrant and savory, this blend of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Colorino boasts juicy black cherry, blackberry and raspberry flavors, while notes of white pepper and cinnamon add depth. It's balanced and delicious with fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2016.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend

"Dark-skinned berry, scorched earth, clove, worn leather and oak-driven spice scents present themselves to the nose. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and a green note of powdered sage alongside close-grained tannins that grip the finish and leave an astringent, tongue-drying finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A proprietary, nonvintage blend sourced from Lodi that's 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Old Vine Zinfandel and 10% Syrah, a wine with bright black and red fruit, good concentration and thick, oaky tannins.",US-California-Red Blend
"A tremendous Syrah, so rich and tasty, it makes you wonder why more people don't drink this variety. Shows intense, explosive blackberry, currant, bacon and black pepper flavors, with a savory hint of raisins. New oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. Dramatic and lush, this single-vineyard Syrah will provide good drinking over the next four years.",US-California-Syrah
"Here's an intense, nervy young Cab that impresses for its powerful oak and cassis flavors. It's a little sharp now, with an acidic jamminess and tea-like tannic structure that suggests moderate aging capability. Stash it until 2008, then open for a couple of years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Notes of honey and yellow fruit give this wine both sweetness and softness. It has weight and a rich mouthfeel, powered by a warm and rounded texture. There is just a touch of dryness at the heart of what is otherwise a medium-sweet wine.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"This unusual rosé is all Pinot Gris, picked for thick skins, chewy tannins, high acidity, and given a 36-hour cold soak prior to fermentation. It's a pale salmon/copper shade, full-bodied and juicy, with fruit flavors of peach and citrus. Highlights of hibiscus tea and floral aromatics contribute further complexity.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Strong scents of cola and chocolate come up quickly from the glass, and those flavors notes override the light strawberry and cherry fruit. With a bit of breathing time they all combine gracefully, crafting a full forward wine with a pleasing creamy texture.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"With exceptional dryness, acidic crispness and minerality, this Chardonnay can be described as Chablis-style. The structure is certainly noble, and nobody would ever accuse it of being a fruit bomb despite the rich pineapple tart and lemon drop flavors. Hard to predict its future, but probably best over the next four years.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Tender notes of orange peel and pear skin reach the nose. The palate shows a vivid note of orange peel, with an herbal hint of mint and a wonderfully light, fluid touch. There is concentration but also poise, absolute dryness and wonderful length. There is an elegant touch that makes this all the more seductive, especially on the tingling zesty finish. A total joy. Drink 2017–2030.",France-Alsace-Riesling

The wine is ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend

"An easy, fun rosé, with apricot, peach, orange and melon flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. The finish is nice and dry.",US-California-Rosé

"This is an easy-gulping, light wine with fruity aromas, nice cherry and raspberry flavors, medium body and a soft mouthfeel.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Beautiful now, with a lovely texture and delicious flavors, this could even benefit from a couple years in the cellar. The vineyard is very fine, and Lost Canyon has a good track record with it. The flavors of cherries, black raspberries, licorice, cola and spice are ever shifting, making you want to try a second, third, fourth sip. Best now–2009, before it loses vitality.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This big soft wine smells and tastes a little sweet, as an aroma like maple syrup leads to flavors of blackberry jam, cinnamon and butter.",US-California-Merlot
"This unusual and distinctive Zin has a silky texture and rich, finely ground tannins. The flavors range from classic black and red currants, mulberries, cloves and pepper to pastry flavors of coconut macaroon and fig cookie. Could easily develop over a decade.",US-California-Zinfandel
"White currants and fresh apricots dominate this fruity, fragrant wine. Bright acidity is enveloped by the generous texture and touch of toast. This rich wine is ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"For this sparkler, fermentation occurs inside of the bottle instead of large pressurized tanks like the majority of Prosecco. This is simple and fresh, with a bright, almost sour, citrus-driven finish.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Sweet-seeming oak aromas and flavors match well with the full body and ripe cherry and berry notes, giving a broad, mouthcoating texture and sense of warmth. Winemaker Elizabeth Grant-Douglas aged the wine in French oak barrels, 30% new.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Here's a young, strong, vigorous wine that needs cellar time. It's absolutely dry, and hits the palate with numbing tannins. But the blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors are intense and concentrated. Earns its high score by the wonderful combination of elegance and potency. Hold until after 2015.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Among the four Rieslings designated as off dry, this shows the most sweetness on the palate, with a slightly granular mouthfeel, like crystallized cane sugar. It accents the round fruit flavors of Meyer lemon and satsuma orange, which overflow the midpalate and run into a lingering finish with a touch of orange pekoe tea.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Damp forest and dried cherry with cranberry combine on the nose and palate in this wine, sourced predominantly from Monterey County. Soft and silky it risks veering off balance once the oak begins to unwrap, becoming quite burly on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"From one of the most esteemed vineyards in the denomination, this features aromas of oak, toast, black berry and a whiff of rubber. The palate offers plum, black cherry, roasted coffee bean, spearmint and vanilla alongside bracing tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Sweet with a burnt aftertaste, this wine cannot be highly recommended.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Full-bodied and generously flavorful, this is shaped and accented by oak influences, but still governed by rich, enticing flavors of ripe plum, dark cherry, blackberry and cinnamon. It features great depth of flavor, breadth in the silky texture and length on the finish. Best now through 2020.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The nose needs air but as it wakes up, subtle notes of fragrant baked peach rise. On the palate a streak of lemon freshness provides both frame and direction, alongside a lovely apple-skin texture. Made from a blend of Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewürztraminer this unites the virtues of each variety. This is full of life and impresses with its great precision and freshness. The finish is bone dry. Lovely now but will age. Drink now through 2025.",France-Alsace-Alsace white blend
"Fortified Tannat makes for a rich while also tannic wine. Its sweet, jammy fruit and the opulence that comes from the addition of spirit are tempered by firm tannins. It should be aged for another year or two and will be best from 2019.",France-Southwest France-Tannat
"Swathes of green herbs add a blast of freshness to ripe, rich stone-fruit and quince notes on this bone-dry, single-vineyard Riesling. It's remarkably complex, with layers of crushed-stone minerality, lime and lime-pith notes that reverberate on the finish.",US-New York-Riesling
"Smooth and simple stuff. It's quite fresh and clean, with more citrus and cherry than what you'd get from a Catalonian Pinot Noir. And that's because this is made entirely from the Trepat grape, which results in a racy, zippy personality. A refreshing cava for fans of leaner, crisper styles.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"This is a beautifully floral, high in acidity white made in small quantities that offers classically lean layers of wet stone and lemon. With a low imprint of oak, it remains structured on the palate and entirely pleasing from start to finish, its honeysuckle aromas singularly inviting.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Soft and warm, with toast and butter adding richness to the white peach and green plum fruits. The acidity and texture are very evident, giving this wine a certain nervous energy.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Nice floral, pear and vanilla notes waft from the nose. Its body is on the soft side, but the sweetish, white stone fruit-and-citrus profile (and its bargain price) are surefire crowd pleasers.",Australia-Australia Other-Chardonnay
"Gentle fruit notes of creamy citrus signal a restrained style. The palate is a mix of peachy, juicy richness and mandarin-peel freshness. This is a mild, off dry, gently perfumed and balanced wine.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"This is a crisp, minerally wine you could drink as an interesting alternative to Sauvignon Blanc. It's rich in citrus, apricot and floral flavors that finish with a honey, fruity flourish. Try with Asian fare.",US-California-Verdelho
"This savory red delivers aromas and flavors of mature black plum, juicy blackberry, licorice and a hint of tobacco. A note of bitter prune accents the firm, succulent finish.",Italy-Southern Italy-Red Blend
"Dusty, generic plum and berry aromas are highly regular. This Malbec is chunky in feel, without much precision. Oaky buttery slightly greasy berry flavors finish hot and creamy, with little to no elegance or cut.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This is a hugely flavored, extracted Pinot Noir, distinctly Californian in its ripeness and size. It's massive in cherries and raspberries, with hints of cocoa, anise, Indian spices and black pepper. With 60% new French oak, it's also pretty toasty. A bit ungainly now, but should gain in the cellar. Better after 2013.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Dry and intricate, with Zinny flavors of wild raspberries, nettles, thyme and pepper. Yet there are some overripe notes of raisins that give this dry wine a Porty taste.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This comes across as quite sweet and tannic at the same time, with plummy fruit and drying tannins warring on the palate.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Black olive, blackberry and smoky charcuterie make this an interesting Merlot. It comes from the cooler confines of Carneros, where it meets the sprawling Sonoma Coast. Austere, the midpalate delves into coffee and chocolate notes.",US-California-Merlot
"Really delicious, a rich, opulent wine that beguiles from first sip to last. It's sweetly caramelized and vanilla-oaky, with crisp acidity brightening ultraripe flavors of pineapples, golden mangoes and buttered toast.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Old vines give a solid structure for this firm wine that is concentrated and dense. With wood aging and rich berry fruits, it's a complex wine with a good future. The black currant and berry fruits have a fresh character as well as great acidity. Drink from 2017.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"A strong effort from Olsen Estates, this 100% Syrah has fine varietal character, in a rough and tumble style. Cured meats, herbs, earth and hints of sea salt mingle with the wild berry fruit flavors. It's balanced and fresh, with lingering and nuanced flavors threading through the gulpable finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Aromas of herbs, crushed flowers, peppery spice and dark fruit are followed by sweet cherry flavors that taper toward the finish. The volatiles are just in check.",US-Washington-Syrah

"Apple, lime and mineral aromas lend freshness to a mature nose. This feels round and plump, but well balanced due to fine acidity. Peach and citrus flavors are stony and finish with tropical notes of lychee and mango. Drink now.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Soft and luscious, this has just enough tannin and acidity to give structure to the delicious black-cherry, cocoa and bacon flavors. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Aromas of withered white rose, resin and dried stone fruit mingle with an unusual whiff of paraffin. On the sweet, concentrated palate, orange blossom honey emphasizes the dried apricot and citrus zest.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Moscato
"This wine has no added sulfur, giving crisp, clear and clean fruitiness. It also adds an light touch of oxidation that broadens the wine and makes the white stone fruit richer. Drink this impressively ripe wine from 2018.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine is lightly structured with tannins and shows red berry and cherry fruit, although with little varietal character. It's attractively juicy due to its acidity and perfumed aftertaste. Drink now.",France-France Other-Pinot Noir
"The distinctive aroma resembles tamarind, cranberries and new oak barrels. Flavors are bright and pure, and the mouthfeel is firm with tannins while staying smooth and velvety. This is very tasty and unique, made in a full-bodied style. Zinfandel and Primitivo make up 77% of it, along with Barbera and Petite Sirah.",US-California-Red Blend
"Polished and balanced, this elegant red opens with scents of rose, red berry, tilled earth and truffle. The firmly structured palate delivers juicy raspberry, crunchy red cherry, licorice and a hint of nutmeg alongside bright acidity and taut, refined tannins. Drink 2018–2030.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"There's a feral quality to this bottling by the trio of Brandon Sparks-Gillis and John and Steve Dragonette that makes it fascinating.

There is strong ginger and mace spice on the sip, giving intrigue to the light strawberry, red plum and pomegranate fruits.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A wine that is moving towards sweet, this is balanced and attractive. Honey and acidity frame the melon and ripe creamed apple fruits. With a touch of spice at the end, the wine is ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"Shows wonderful purity of fruit—green apple and lime, perhaps a touch of flower shop greens—and impreccable balance, being light in body, off dry, crisp and refreshing. Delicious.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"This full-bodied wine packs a lot of punch in terms of mouthfeel and flavor. The color is extremely dark, and the flavors resemble dark chocolate, black cherries and baking spices. It is dry in style, with lip-smacking, nicely astringent tannins that counterbalance all that richness.",US-California-Red Blend
"Light strawberry fruit carries an undertone of dried grass. It turns a little sour in the mouth, but it's fine for the price.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A firm and focused Cabernet Franc, with just 5% Merlot in the blend, this spent 18 months in 50% new American oak. It's a straight-ahead style, with a red berry flavor and polished, proportionate tannins.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"From an estate just to the west of Saint-Estèphe, this wine is structured and firm. A dry core of solid tannins balances the black-currant fruitiness. The wine is firm now although it will develop quickly, so drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Wood aging and ripe fruit combine to make a structured and rich wine that has good potential. It's solid, concentrated with all the minerality and texture of the Douro. With vineyards on the high plateau north of the Douro, the wine has a cool edge that keeps it fresh, despite the alcohol.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red

Just a baby now, this wine should have a long life ahead of it. Best after 2022.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This starts with aromas of rose, crushed violet, red berry and mint. The palate delivers red and black cherry accented with notes of cocoa and mocha alongside youthfully assertive tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"The nose is rather shy but eventually reveals suggestions of berry, aromatic herb and oak-driven spice. The assertive palate offers licorice, coffee and raw cherry alongside grainy tannins that clench the lean finish. You'll also notice a green note of powdered sage.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"This totally young, herbaceous wine is packed with fruitiness. Crisp lemon and a dash of grapefruit accent this local blend of Colombard, Ugni Blanc and Sauvignon Blanc. It's bright, ready to drink now.",France-Southwest France-White Blend
"This is smooth, round and Zinfandel-like in its fulsome toasty character and abundant chocolate and black fruit flavors. As it's aged in 100% new French oak for 17 months, the oak looms large and lasts a long time.",US-California-Petit Verdot
"Situated in the northern part of the Côte de Beaune, the vines produce soft, ripe wines. This wine is typical of this style with just enough tannins to bolster the rich berry fruits. It features a juicy backdrop along with touches of wood and spice. It needs time; drink from 2020.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir

Drink now–2020.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz-Viognier

"Blackberry syrup, vanilla, mocha and a flash of mint are cut by a rocky edge on the nose of this blend of 58% Tempranillo, 21% Grenache and 21% Malbec.

The lean palate is already evolved, showing yellow-apple skin, bitter almond and a hint of citrus zest alongside bracing acidity.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"This wine aims to call attention to the tendency of Clone 17 (also known as the Robert Young clone) to provide baked apple and ripe, almond flavors and aromas, which this bottling does, in spades. Caramel, oak and vanilla round out the rest of the experience, which is balanced, but big in ripeness and wood.",US-California-Chardonnay
One whiff and you can tell this leans towards overripe. Aromas of raisin and baked berry fruits are stewy and cooked. This feels much like it smells: heavy and baked. Flavors of raisin and prune finish similar.,Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Funky green aromas ride high atop stewed plum, cardamom and coffee grounds. This wine feels saturated and jammy, as if it were spreadable. Herbal berry and juniper flavors are borderline weedy, and it tastes green on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"What this Pinot lacks in opulence, it makes up for in elegance. The construction is as severely tailored as an Italian suit. Bone dry and quite tart in acidity, the flavors tread a delicate balance between ripe red cherries and persimmons to greener notes of heirloom tomatoes. Aging is doubtful, so give it a good decant.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Vanilla wafer, slightly mealy apple and citrus aromas open this slightly unfocused wine. The palate is flat, with flavors of green fruit and citrus that finish abruptly.",Chile-Maule Valley-Sauvignon Blanc

"A classic interpretation of a red Bordeaux blend, this holds almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, in addition to smaller amounts of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. The wine offers mint, sage and cedar that give a brushy quality around blackberry and cassis. With a juicy core, it's complex and lengthy, the oak subdued.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Owned by the Quiot family of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this is one of a pair of wines produced from the region of Sainte-Victoire. It is a full and fruity wine, rich with raspberries and freshened by final grapefruit acidity.",France-Provence-Rosé
"The Domaine cuvée spent 20 months in French oak, 30% new and another 30% once-used. The concentrated, well-ripened fruit sets up a chunky core of strawberry jam that plays nicely against defining acidity. It remains focused and pure through a driving, lingering finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Acids and tannins dominate, at the expense of fruit, giving this Pinot Noir a hard, rustic feel. The cherry flavors aren't strong enough to bust through the dryness.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Produced from Malbec and fashionably pale, this wine is named after Julie Perrin, daughter of owner Alain-Dominique Perrin. It is light and deliciously crisp and refreshing. Bone dry, it is certainly a food rosé, although with its light raspberry flavor it will also be good as an apéritif. Julie Perrin, an artist, worked on the blend and created the château watercolor on the bottle.",France-Southwest France-Rosé
"Parducci's '03 True Grit was a sensation. The '04 is a worthy successor. Dry, tannic and amazingly rich, it floods the mouth with blackberry, cherry, currant, leather, coffee, carob and peppery spice flavors that go on and on in the finish. Like any great young Petite Sirah, it will age for many years.",US-California-Petite Sirah

"With strong wood-aging flavors, this is a full, very ripe and concentrated wine. Coming from old vines, it has depth of flavor, both fruity and rich. Peach and pear flavors dominate, along with spice from wood aging. The wine needs some aging, so drink from 2015.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"A very light floral nose opens to an apple-cider and clove palate. The soft mousse and round mouthfeel set up for the clean apple and spice finish. A touch sweet, but it has a relaxed appeal.",US-New York-Champagne Blend
"Food friendly, this has soft tones of peach and melon. There's a touch of fresh acidity that helps to smooth out the naturally rich perlage.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"It's pure and aromatic, with black cherry hard candy fruit flavors. Tannins have been nicely managed; there's a sweet herb undertone without the bitter green edge.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"This medium-bodied wine has very subtle aromas and flavors, a fairly smooth texture, and an ever-so-slightly buttery accent. It offers a slim personality to enjoy.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"A firm, dry, foursquare wine that has power and structure rather than the immediate perfumes of La Mouline, the partner cuvée from Guigal. This is the wine for those who want power with big tannins, and they don't come more powerful or tannic than this. Its aging potential is enormous:  after 10 years there should be more sign of the perfumed fruit which is there, somewhere.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Crisp, coastal acidity dominates this wine, making it mouth-wateringly tart. May be too much for some folks, but it's quite elegant, with good cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors enriched with a touch of smoky oak.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Earthy aromas of fresh tarragon and burnt cedar make an intriguing start to this wine, whose soft opening on the palate veers quickly into heavy flavors of chopped oregano. A plum element emerges faintly on the midpalate, but this is a solid wine for herb lovers.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"A ripe, toasty wine, full in the mouth with a strong edge of tannins, complex spice and baked apple flavors. It is mature, not a wine likely to develop much further, now at its best, and a disappointment for this prestige wine from Pommery.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This opens with earthy—almost funky—aromas of game, truffle, leather, a hint of overripe dark-skinned fruit and a balsamic note. The palate offers black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and chopped herb alongside ripe tannins. An anise note closes the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"With 15.4% alcohol by volume, this is arguably Lail's ripest, hottest Cabernet ever. It certainly has flashy blackberry and cherry jam flavors, with plenty of toasty oak, but there's a raisin-and-prune, overripe finish. Could age, but it's more likely that the heat will pinch in within six years, crushing the fruit.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This bone-dry high-acid wine puts flavors of grapefruit flesh and rind front and center. It's a no-fuss summer sipper, perhaps not quite as rich as previous vintages, or maybe just exceptionally young. It's tangy, fresh and focused.",US-Oregon-Rosé
"An impressive wine from old vines. The 2009 has an extra depth of richness and full character. The black fruits go deep into the wine, hugely rich while still keeping a dark structure. Powerful and needing aging.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"There's an awkward touch of overripe apple and orange zest that blows off fast enough to reveal red fruit, cherry and Indian spice. The close is sharp and crisp.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Sweet and toasty, with overt oak, sarsparilla, raisin and coconut aromas. It feels supersaturated, with monster tannins. Flavors of black coffee, chocolate, spice, pepper and licorice are rich and deep, while the finish is chewy, meaty and long. Drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Oak jumps out first, both on the nose and on the palate, before waves of grenadine liqueur and raspberry take over. Velvety in texture, the wine is earthy, with well-integrated tannins and a lingering finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is one of those Zinfandels that needs food. On its own, it's a rustic wine, sweet in red jam and raisins, tannic, acidic and fairly oaky. It has considerable complexity, coming from a century-old vineyard that contains at least a dozen grape varieties barely grown anymore in California. Will be excellent with any form of beef stew, short ribs, Mexican beef-centered food, or a lusty lasagna.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah comes from adjacent blocks planted in 2002. It was aged in new French oak for 42 months, so the nose delivers rich aromas of sugar plum, gingerbread spice and black-cherry syrup. The palate is quite dry, with a dark-chocolate bitterness, woody juniper flavors and firm, structured tannins that give depth to the black-plum core and vanilla-pie-crust touch on the finish.",US-California-Red Blend
"Most Airfield Estate wines are single variety; this is their Bordeaux-style blend, made from five Bordeaux grape varieties. More than 50% Cabernet Sauvignon sourced from young vines, it's bright with fresh red berry and pomegranate fruit, set amidst a generous splash of brown spices. The wines spent two years in 50% new French oak, and should continue to improve over the next five years.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Raw, green aromas suggest underripe fruit, green tobacco and green herbs. Following the nose, this feels astringent and clampy. Herbal flavors of plum don't taste as green as this smells, while the finish is rugged and tannic.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Solid and structured, this shows the firm side of Fleurie. It is dominated by tannins that overlay the red berry fruit and the firm plum-skin texture. With its weight and concentration, this needs to age for another 2–3 years.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This open, fruity wine has a soft side. Apples and pears are prominent along with a touch of spice. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This vineyard selection offers a compact and clean aromatic package that hits all the right notes without being overdone. Blackberry, cherry, vanilla and spice chime in on the palate and help drive the wine's long, chewy finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
This austere Barolo opens with a ripe note of prune and blackberry followed by sweet spice and moist pipe tobacco. The wine is chewy and rich with a succulent quality of tannins.,Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Initially dusty mineral tones blow off to reveal an aromatic bouquet full of fresh lilacs and cassis. Tart blackberry and cherry flavors on the palate are bristling and spry, accented by touch of sage and delicate tannins on the finish.",US-New York-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of wild berry, espresso, dark spice and French oak take center stage while the firmly structured palate delivers raspberry jam, licorice, tobacco and coffee along with a slightly green note of powdered sage. Assertive fine-grained tannins provide an austere backbone. Drink 2019–2027.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"One of Temecula's pioneering vintners, Phil Baily takes his balanced wines seriously. This bottling shows lots of damp earth, black olive, concentrated mulberry, dried herbs and cardamom on the nose. Stewed black-cherry fruit meshes with Indian spice and well-integrated tannins on the palate that is built for aging.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lush, jammy black fruit fills the palate on this dense, boldly structured blend of Bulgarian Rubin and Merlot grapes. It's undeniably juicy and forward, but balanced by a streak of sharp acidity and soft, chalky tannins that linger.",Bulgaria-Thracian Valley-Red Blend
"Savory, earthy notes similar to soy precede plump and fleshy notes of almost overripe black cherry and plum. The palate is light and fresh but bouncy with full fruitiness and the slightest tannic texture and a lip-smacking finish. A summer red of sorts that could even be chilled.",Austria-Burgenland-Zweigelt
"Berries, citrus, even suggestions of tropical fruits (papaya, guava) anchor this supple wine. It's a wine that invites leisurely exploration, nuanced and refined, with balance and body enough to age for up to a decade.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"The small village of Auxey-Duresses is well known for its attractive, cool and fruity whites. This bottling is only lightly oaked, showing plenty of fine acidity and a crisp, clean texture. Not a wine for aging, drink now for its tangy character and bright aftertaste.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A wine that is dominated by wood at this stage in its development. But the structure and the fruit are all there, waiting to slot into place in the next 2–3 years. Spice and bright black berry flavors layer with final acidity.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of almond skins, pyrazines and spent white fruits struggle to draw you in. This vintage was wet and cool in Galicia, with frost issues, and this shows it. The palate is round but oily in feel, while flavors of saline water, pithy citrus and bitter melon finish peppery and soft, with low acidity.",Spain-Northern Spain-Godello
"Hugely sweet yet reasonably balanced given its enormous concentration, this is a tremendous example of the quality heights sweet Riesling can achieve. Golden raisin, dried apricots and candied pineapple all swirl together in a delicious haze of sugar-coma-inducing syrup that nevertheless goes down easily. Will age easily for decades.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Named after the winery's cellar master, the nose of this wine is deep and brooding in black cherry punch and spicy blackberry, accented by sawdust and anise. Velvety tannins frame the medium-bodied palate, offering substantial grip to a mix of tart mixed berries, with coffee and violet on the finish.",US-Virginia-Petit Verdot
"Deep garnet in color, this wine has a nose marked by black cherry and blackberry scents. It's soft on entry but brightens as it washes across the palate, offering blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Velvety tannins persist into the zesty, cranberry-tinged finish.",Israel-Galilee-Merlot
"There's good Santa Barbara character in this Chardonnay, with brisk acidity and minerality girding the tropical fruit and peach flavors. It's a little thin, but elegantly structured.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Soft, simple and sweet, with jellied raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. Tastes like an inferior dessert wine.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Oaky aromas like smoked bacon and rich, fruity flavors give this wine a lot of personality. It has a soft, thick texture and a hint of sweetness that rounds it out.",US-California-Red Blend
"Just pop the cork, let it breathe and enjoy it as it does its thing. One of the best Adelsheim wines this taster can remember. Full of red plum, raspberry and currant, with the right acidity for it to rock and roll. Healthy tannins round out this supple sipper, which hits its stride after a half-hour of airing and then gallops home.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Merlot and Cabernet, this offers aromas of cherry-berry and dessert spices that carry over to the palate, along with a licorice note. It's ripe and round but also a bit tired, with a drying, tannic finish.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"A combination of grapes from around the county has produced a complex, nuanced wine. It has that dry-sweet thing going on, with no measurable sugar but layers of fruity, flowery flavors, and quite bright acids. It feels fat and oily in the mouth, and even has a touch of spicy oak. Best Buy. —S.H.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"Rugged scents of wild berries and forest woods blend into intriguing aromas on this wine from the highest Pinot Noir vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains. It unleashes a rainbow of flavors, from acai and red fruit to rum cake and brown spices to mocha, tea, tobacco and Dr. Pepper.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"This big, rich wine is packed with dark fruit. After eight years, it is now showing maturity with leather tannins, dense structure and juicy black plum-skin flavors. Despite its age, it still shows well, with proper final wood notes, tannins and acidity. Drink now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"From one of the Napa Valley's most historically famous sites, this Cab delivers a testament to gamy blackberry and blueberry alongside complex cassis, clove and black licorice. Full bodied and richly concentrated, it's also soft and well integrated, entirely pleasurable now, with years to go in terms of structure and body. Cellar through 2027 and possibly beyond.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine offers a generosity of caramelized, toasty oak before presenting full-bodied richness and concentration in baked apple and pear flavor. A note of sea spray complements the fruitier aspects and gives a hint of minerality.",US-California-Chardonnay
This older vintage Syrah still has some fruit but otherwise shows drying tannins and leathery smoke.,US-California-Syrah
"Aromas of hay, baked corn and honey suggest that this wine has lost or is fast losing its vitality. The palate is round and full, with honeyed, soft flavors of apple and grass. Finishes mushy, another indication that it's on its last legs.",Chile-Central Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Held back longer than most Chardonnays, this single-vineyard wine is beginning to pick up bottle complexity. It's a connoisseur's wine, not dazzlingly rich and sweet, but dry, acidic and minerally, with lemon and orange citrus fruit flavors. You have to appreciate subtlety to like this artisanal wine. Should evolve in interesting ways over the next six years.",US-California-Chardonnay
"With honest PN aromas of cherry, rhubarb, currant and spice, this registers as something Pinot drinkers can relate to. There's modest weight and good acidity, with spicy, tea-influenced flavors of plum and raspberry. Dry with some cocoa on the finish. Surprisingly nice for a $9 Chilean Pinot.",Chile-Central Valley-Pinot Noir
"Fresh acidity and a dry style make this a great food rosé. It has crisp red berry and currant fruits,  vibrant acidity and a lively aftertaste.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"This is bold and assertive, yet mellow. Dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, it shows the house style of soft approachability and complexity, offering tiers of blackberry, currant, sage, dried herb and smoky oak. Drink now–2015.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a supreme small-lot Argentine wine from lauded winemaker Jorge Riccitelli. The blend is 70% Malbec with 20% Cabernet and 10% Merlot. Aromas of loam, wild berry and vanilla are elegant and exciting. This is silky smooth, with creamy oak and ripe black-fruit flavors playing together through a mellow, plush finish. Drink this impressive, complete Malbec blend through 2016.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The herb, grapefruit, tropical fruit and melon aromas are light but very varietal. The palate has a slight spritz that perks up the tangy fruit flavors.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of violet, blueberry and baking spice almost explode from the glass. The medium-bodied palate tastes of raspberry, cassis and clove while round tannins and fresh acidity give it balance. It's made for sheer drinking pleasure so enjoy soon.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Lagrein
"This opens with earthy aromas of scorched earth, overripe plum and a whiff of game. The straightforward palate offers juicy wild cherry, raspberry jam, coffee and vanilla alongside zesty acidity and fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2017.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"This thick, juicy, inky wine (with a large component of Petit Verdot) would pair with aged cheese or pecorino. The wine is still young (let it age five more years) with firm, sticky tannins and loads of blackberry and plum cake on the long finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Some unripe notes of vegetables mar this otherwise likeable wine. It's very dry and soft, with firm tannins and cherry, cocoa and cedar flavors.",US-California-Charbono
"A lightly wood-aged wine, this is floral and spicy. With its pear and citrus flavors, soft texture and fine mature fruit, it is nicely balanced and ready to drink.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese White
"This is from Rubissow, and it's a nice wine for the price. Essentially a Bordeaux blend with a splash of Syrah, it's rich and satisfying in blackberry, cassis, mocha, bacon and pepper flavors, with a coating of sweet oak. Lovely now with anything from a nice steak to a beef burrito.",US-California-Red Blend
"Searingly dry, to the edge of sour, this emphasizes mineral and citrus rind over fruit. This austere style might match well with some sausages on the grill to cut the acidity.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"A wonderfully complete wine, with all the elements in place. It is ripe and powerful, the black fruits jammy and rich. But at the same time, the layer of acidity, the dark tannins and the succulent texture all come together in a finely balanced way. It is almost exotic, but the tannins promise good potential for aging.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Soft and appealing, this Pinot offers lush, elaborate flavors of raspberry and cherry pie filling, mocha and sandalwood flavors, finished with sweet, dusty Indian spices. It's made for drinking now.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Produced from organic grapes, this is a smooth, lightly toasty wine. It has ripe apple and a crisp tight, mineral texture that adds to the refreshing character of the wine. The aftertaste is all fresh fruit.",France-Loire Valley-Sparkling Blend
"There's no oak at all on this savory young Sauvignon Blanc, which delivers its richness directly to the palate, undiluted. Those flavors are of green fruits: melons, apples, limes and the slightly sour, flowery tang of gooseberries. Fine acidity makes it all brisk and mouthwatering. An outstanding Sauvignon Blanc for today's ethnic fare, at a great price.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This shows what extended aging can do for a vintage sparkling wine, as it gives off delicate, ripe, mellow aromas like toasted baguette, honey, toasted almonds, white tea and apple cider. The mouthfeel is elegant and smooth, while the bubbles are soft and slow. Enjoy this before or after dinner now; it's at its aging peak.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Both nose and palate display a contrast between rounded ripe pear fruit augmented by residual sweetness and a rather bitter, pithy and phenolic edge. There is freshness here, but heat, too. It seems out of balance.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"Underbrush, charred earth, ripe dark-skinned fruit, grilled herb and a whiff of cooking spice aromas all come together on this chewy red. The round palate doles out fleshy black cherry, cured meat, chopped herb and tobacco while a touch of star anise backs up the finish. Robust, velvety tannins support the juicy fruit. This will offer fine near-to-mid-term pleasure.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"The crisp nose conjures up shades of green: meadow and fresh apple peel, fresh foliage and lime, but also some honey and oatmeal. The palate remains crisp but has a toned lithe note of pure lemon that sings. This is taut, shows backbone and rounds itself out wonderfully on the palate, finishing with harmonious notes of apple and shortbread.",England-England-Sparkling Blend
"Strawberry jam dances around high-strung cranberry, pomegranate and rhubarb, combining for a tantalizing experience of earthy dried herb and cardamom. Light bodied but never thin, it finishes with a flourish of succulent orange peel.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Lots of toasty oak can't hide the fact that the underlying wine has a strong vegetal note, with some apricot and pineapple flavors. Tasted twice.",US-California-Chardonnay
"In line with this winery's penchant for oak, this fast-aging wine is buttery and heavily toasted. As a result, snappy apple or citrus fruit is harder to find than many might want it to be. Nevertheless, there's some bold lemon and creamy vanilla on the thick, mouthfilling palate. And for that, it earns points.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Benjamin Silver offers a very traditional tar and roses nose on this solid wine, with extra aromas of leather, iron, pipe smoke, iodine and beef jerky. The palate shows white pepper, roasted fennel and tight pomegranate fruit, with some gaminess and tobacco leaf, as well as grippy tannins that will continue to soften with time.",US-California-Nebbiolo
"A good amount of sweet smoke and cured bacon aromas integrate seamlessly with the boysenberry and black plum notes. Ripe, juicy fruit flavors provide a mouthwatering sensation on the palate, while a touch of tobacco leaf and charred cedar lingers on the long finish.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Merlot
"The nose is inexpressive while the lean, rather diluted palate offers dried herb, citrus zest and a note of bitter almond. Brisk acidity completes the picture.",Italy-Central Italy-Verdicchio
"This clonal study by Clarissa Nagy shows lots of brown spice, pomegranate fruit and wet slate on the nose, which is shy at first until a deeper sniff reveals juiciness. The palate offers an herbal medley of oregano, thyme and marjoram, spicing up the cranberry fruit, graphite and cocoa shavings.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a warm rich enveloping wine that opens with details such as candied orange peel and maraschino cherries. It's smooth and resonant across a palate of plummy purple fruits, and there's just a hint of brown rum in the aftertaste. Drink now through 2024.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Supple and silky, this expressive, seductive wine offers ripe plum and cherry fruit matched to polished tannins. It's finished with tasty barrel flavors of coconut, butter pecan and toast, and it is thoroughly, irresistibly delicious.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Peach, cantaloupe, pear and a touch of citric zest characterize this expertly made white wine from southern Italy. Beyond the fruit aromas, you'll also pick up notes of white flower and mineral-flint that add dimension and complexity. Drink it well-chilled with seafood or white meat.",Italy-Southern Italy-Fiano
"This fruity, light wine is full of red berries. The tannins are there, playing a supporting role to the intense fruitiness and acidity that's typical of the vintage. This wine will develop quickly, so drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This is thick, rich and very beerenauslese-like, combining honey and dried apricot aromas with similar flavors and a touch of candied pineapple. It's sweeter and richer than the regular auslese, but only more appealing for true sugar hounds, who'll admire its extreme viscosity and long, mouthcoating finish.",Germany-Mosel-Saar-Ruwer-Riesling
"Rounded, smooth and fruity, this is an attractive wine. With its light texture and acidity that balance the juicy black fruits, it is ripe while also poised. The aftertaste is fresh and fruity.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red

"New wood gives this wine a polished feel, its berry fruits pushing through dense tannins. It is balanced in the sense that fruit and wood are coming well together, but this impressive wine needs several years' aging.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red

"Sourced from the Sangiacomo and Gap's Crown vineyards within the Petaluma Gap area of the appellation, this is a tight, tangy wine. Full of citrus, cranberry and dried herb, it finishes savory in sage and forest floor accents. The acidity is subtle and the tannins integrated, making for a well-balanced wine.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Given the vineyard location, on the eastern edge of the Columbia Gorge, this is a unique take on Merlot, falling somewhere between the broad, fleshy Washington style, and the thinner, more herbal southern Oregon style. The layered flavors mix berry, citrus and red plum, in an open, easy-drinking wine that should pair well with a variety of transitional autumn entrées.",US-Oregon-Merlot
"Sharp and a bit disjointed, this is an uneasy mix of sweet strawberry fruit and stemmy tannins. The Tempranillo is blended with 25% Cabernet Franc.",US-Washington-Tempranillo

"Minty, this restrained Syrah is from a sought-after vineyard, a pioneer in Sonoma County Rhône-style wines. Here, the producer keeps things interesting in swathes of white pepper, mint and cranberry, as well as a strong sense of leather throughout. High in acidity, it needs time to come together; try after 2020.",US-California-Syrah
"This is a very fine expression of this always richly structured appellation. It is still young, dominated by firm tannins as well as dark black fruits and the spice of wood aging. The acidity, the black cherry flavors and the density of the wine all suggest its great potential. Drink from 2020.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay

Should develop for up to a decade.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine is somewhat weedy and herbal, with extracted black fruit displaying prominently on the palate. Oaky and tannic, it overwhelms somewhat, needing time in the glass to settle down.",US-California-Zinfandel
"There's a touch of unripeness in this wine that shows up as a taste of green peppercorn, although it's very subtle, and the blackberry and black cherry fruit quickly washes it away. Other than that, the wine is dry and rich in tannins. Drink now.",US-California-Syrah
"Made from Syrah and Grenache, this is a big, powerful blush wine, with jammy strawberry and raspberry flavors. It's sweet on the finish, almost a dessert wine. If this is your style, it's for you.",US-California-Rosé

"The Knoll Grüner style is for a hint of steel, doses of minerality and not too much ornateness despite the wonderfully elaborate traditional bottle labels.

"Shy and reserved on the nose, this wine is invitingly smooth and velvety in texture, with an intensity at its core. Anise, black tea, rose petals and cherry pie all figure in, with a juicy succulence making it pleasurable from first sip to last drop.",US-California-Pinot Noir

Spicy on the finish, with a blast of clove and cardamom. Very good but not as filled out as in prior years.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Dark colored wine, revealing wood aging both aromatically and to taste. That said, it also has great weight, a powerful and complex wine with its coffee, dried fruit and black plum flavors. It's an impressive, solid wine that deserves at least seven years' aging.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a luscious, young Cabernet that's filled with blackberry and cherry jam flavors, with a touch of overripe prune. It doesn't seem like an ager, but it's dry, and shows classically rich, smooth Napa tannins.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Leather, dark spice, cherries marinated in spirits and a balsamic note come together in the glass. The ripe, chewy palate delivers chocolate covered cherry, coffee, tobacco and clove alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2022–2032.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Rich, concentrated, and loaded with smoky, dark, spicy fruit flavors, this is a full-on Bordeaux blend, with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. There's plenty of barrel influence, from 70% new French oak, but it's welcome, and appropriate, perfectly matched to the power of the fruit. An underlayer of woodsy earth and mushroom adds further complexity.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon

"The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oaky—full of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconut—but there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood. It's a plush, full-bodied wine with immense appeal, for drinking now–2025.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Structured and ripe with black fruits, this wine has some firm tannins along with rich, spicy flavors and acidity. The wine was fermented in open tanks a technique that gives an extra richness and color to the wine. Wood aging has added a final, smoothing touch.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red

Honeyed ripe pear fruit fills the nose. The palate amplifies this rich notion even more with a generous touch of residual sweetness that bathes the pear fruit in caramel richness. There is a glint of pleasant phenolic bitterness here and there but the pear fruit conquers all. This is rich but fresh with a medium-sweet finish ideal for blue cheese.,France-Alsace-Pinot Gris

"Something of both fresh and dried pink grapefruit zest plays about the nose. The very frothy palate adds some spice to that, as well as a pleasant hint of bitterness. All the fruit is accentuated by the frothing bursting bubbles. Drink soon, ideally as an animating apéritif. The zesty finish is very appetizing.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"This blend of 55% Cabernet Franc and 45% Merlot is quite ripe on the nose, with lavish black-currant fruit as well as dried dill and fennel touches.

The extremely ripe palate offers raspberry compote, licorice and a green note of powdered sage alongside bracing tannins that leave a gripping, drying finish. Give the tannins a few years to unwind then drink.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A blend of Merlot and Syrah, the aromas of smoke, matchstick, high-toned dried herb, spice and purple fruit give way to quite sweet-seeming dark-fruit flavors. Lightly grainy tannins provide support. The sweetness seems distracting.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Strongly flavored in wild berries, tobacco and cola, this also has a vegetal note lurking around the edges. It's likeable for its dryness and firm tannins, which should perform well with a steak.",US-California-Zinfandel

"The vineyard bears only a Monterey appellation, but the location is strategically close to both the Santa Lucia Highlands and the Arroyo Seco. The wine is quite good, racy in acidity and dry.

A real success, and a wine that will pick up bottle complexity over the next 4–5 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"From the eastern-reaching Chiles Valley appellation, the vines planted in 1975, this is a soft, juicy and well-made wine, blended with 3% Merlot. Red and black berry star, complemented by a treasure trove of clove. Grippy on the finish, it should cellar well, a robust, full-bodied wine that finishes with a taste of coffee.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Made in a Super-Tuscan style, this includes 12% Syrah and 5% Malbec. Young, tight and still a bit severe, it needs airing out.

Tart and spicy, with cranberry and strawberry fruit flavors under a warm blanket of oak and acid.",US-Washington-Sangiovese
"Smoky, earthy and refined on the nose, this Cab is showing a seamless mix of berry and oak-based aromas.

Drink through 2025.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Initially, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tannat smells murky, leathery and nutty, but with airing it settles and cleans up. Chunky and close to being oversaturated, this full-bodied red tastes of loamy berry and raisin, while the finish is weighty.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Fashion designer/vintner Richard Hirsh is aiming for the mass market with this approachable if slightly sweet blend. Its wide appeal is the result of sun-filled fruit, showing honey, baked apple, orange blossom and tropical notes on the nose. It's soft on the palate, with candied apple, brown sugar and lemongrass flavors.",US-California-White Blend
"This Pinot, which was grown on the Hanzell estate, is described by the winery as a barrel selection made to drink now. Yet it shows tight tannins and an astringency that effectively masks the ripe cherry and pomegranate fruit flavors. You're better off cellaring this wine for a few years.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Leafy, scratchy aromas of dried plum and raspberry give way to lemony, grainy oak scents. This is medium bodied, tightly wound and tastes of dried red fruits mixed with cocoa powder. A spicy, dry, crisp finish reinforces the wine's limitations.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Pinot Noir
"This is as good as Sauvignon Blanc gets in Washington—a dense, pungent, intensely aromatic and gloriously flavorful wine sourced entirely from the Klipsun Vineyard. Inaugural scents suggest wet hay, new-mown grass, fig and citrus. Following are flavors of pineapple, more citrus, beeswax and a suggestion of bee pollen. This is one of those bottles that empties much faster than you'd like.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"Predominantly Cabernet, this the most interesting and complex of all the Long Shadows red blends. It's an aromatic and compelling wine with mixed scents of brambly berries and a touch of violets. Tannins are compact and fully ripe, with none of the chalky character shown in some other reds from this vintage. The juicy acidity and compact strength suggest that further cellaring will reward your patience.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 19% Cab Franc and 10% Petit Verdot is sourced from the Hedges, Stillwater, and Conner Lee vineyards.

"The veteran San Luis Obispo-based winemaker heads south to the historic vineyard to produce this wine. A wildly dynamic nose suggests unripe lemon skin, pencil lead, oak and smoky wisps of a beach campfire. The woody, cedar element—though not really oaky—provides an intriguing palate of pencil shavings, green pear skins and lime pith.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a fresh, medium-bodied white with a touch of honeysuckle on the nose and straightforward flavors that hints of orange and peach. A touch of spice adds interest to the modest finish. Drink now.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style White Blend

"Mouthfilling and supple, this is a top-notch example of Barossa Shiraz. Despite the soft tannins, the fruit is bright and lively, with tart red plum and raspberry notes at the core, surrounded by hints of vanilla and mint.

"There's a heady bouquet of blossom and stone fruit on this lavishly aromatic Riesling that persists from nose to finish. The palate is ripe and juicy, penetrating with honey, yellow cherry and apricot flavors, but cut with a zesty streak of grapefruit and limes. Finishes endlessly long.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Boysenberry, black pepper, hot gravel and beef char show plenty of the 60% Syrah influence. The 40% Cabernet Sauvignon comes through more on the palate, where tart blueberries and violets shine, along with asphalt notes. It finishes with tart acidity.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"A new effort from winemaker Isabelle Dutartre, who also oversees winemaking at De Ponte Cellars. This first release from her own 1789 label brings the stamp of Chehalem Mountains terroir into crisp focus. The fruit is wild and brambly, the acids sharp, the wine spicy with a peppery cast. Persistent and concentrated, with a hint of Dr. Pepper streaking through it.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"This still immature Pinot has tobacco-infused cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors that are liberally oaked and spiced. It's O.K. to drink immediately if you like freshness and vibrancy, but aging it for six years or even longer could reward.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Deep rich black cherry and berry flavors burst with ripeness from nose to finish in this boldly structured Cab.

Dominated by Pinot Noir, this ripe, full-bodied wine has a tangy texture boosted by acidity that contrasts with rich red apple and crisp pear flavors that give richness. Drink now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This comes out of the bottle a little tarry and rubbery, so splash it around a bit while pouring, or opt for a quick decant if that's possible. Once those off aromas dissipate, the wine delivers plenty of herb-tinged cherry fruit, with a medium body and a mouthwatering, fine-grained finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"The aromas bring notes of cream, padded butter and summer squash. The palate is rich and creamy, made in a full-bodied style that brings plenty of appeal.",US-Washington-Chardonnay

"Almost fat in the mouth—at least for a Grüner—this has round fruit flavors of apple and pear, finished with a lick of baking spice.",US-Oregon-Grüner Veltliner

The palate is more simplistic, with purple fruits most prevalent.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Ste. Michelle's Dry Riesling carries a special, gold-colored label, and the word ‘dry' is prominently displayed. Dry it is, tart and bracing, but not so sour as to demand only oysters as an accompaniment. This is an all-purpose Riesling, great with spicy noodle dishes and other palate-burners.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Whoa... need... water. Michael David's Earthquake is all about impact, no bones about it. And this one won't disappoint people who like their wine like finely aged Scotch, high in alcohol. For them, its bold smoky chocolate, savory bacon on toast notes will be delightful.",US-California-Petite Sirah

"Lovely aromatics conjure up rose petals, a dash of body powder and ripe citrus. The fruit is very ripe, with almost a candy character, and there's a sensation of powdered sugar. But despite the almost 14g/L residual sugar, it's more sweet/tart than syrupy, keeping it sappy and refreshing.",US-Oregon-Riesling

"A savory rather than fruity blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache, this bottling offers black pepper, anise and light violet alongside boysenberry and elderberry fruit on the nose.

"Very simple and straightforward, this bright wine opens with aromas of lime, cut grass and white peach. It's crisp and lean on the finish.",Italy-Veneto-Pinot Grigio
"A wine that goes straight into currants along with more exotic fruit like mango. That makes it rich in taste, as well as soft in texture. The acidity is there, but seems almost incidental, lost in the vivid fruits.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"In French, the vineyard name means “the meadow on the mountain,” a fitting name for the site. This is a spicy wine, with a touch of red-hot candy.

"From vines that sit at 1,000 feet overlooking Monterey and the Carmel Valley, this wine only went through partial malolactic fermentation. It shows a tight nose of lemon-laced sour cream and grapefruit blossoms. Lime peels, more sour cream and stronger grapefruit-pith flavors mark the tight, tart palate that has firmness that will mellow with age.",US-California-Chardonnay
Stalky aromas of tomato leaf are light on fruit but generous on the oak. A creamy mouthfeel with soft acidity struggles to support flavors of stewed plum and brown sugar. Residual oak and related caramel flavors carry the finish.,Argentina-Other-Pinot Noir

"Robust, pillowy tannins provide a density and grip that lasts through the finish of this 100% varietal wine. Blackberry, black currant and vanilla are the highlights, finding balance and powerful concentration on the palate.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Smells nice as aromas of lemon curd, honeysuckle and lychee fruit make for a very Viognier-like bouquet. But it is indeed Chardonnay, and the palate of lemon, apple and orange is driving and touched up by forward but controlled oak. Lengthy on the back end, with a kiss of butterscotch. Not refined or Burgundian, but good for Navarra.",Spain-Northern Spain-Chardonnay
"Immediately you'll note that this is light and airy, with floral aromas and touches of cinnamon dust and leather. The blend is 70% Morenillo, an obscure Catalan variety, and Garnacha. The palate is fresh and lithe, while bright raspberry, herb and spice flavors finish in whole, integrated fashion. Drink through 2018.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend

"Rodney Strong's Symmetry is more tannic than their '05 Reserve Cab, and it also has more complex flavors from being a blend of all five Bordeaux varieties. It shows a deep streak of dark stone fruits, black and blue berries, cassis, carob, violets and smoky cedar. Fine and elegant now, and it should develop nicely over the next decade.",US-California-Meritage
"Simple red-berry aromas are about as good as this gets. In the mouth, it's wet but dilute. Flavors of pithy citrus and grass finish with grapefruit and bitter flavors. This is basic at best and empty at worst.",Spain-Northern Spain-Rosado
"Good, in a simple way, with Chardonnay personality that will appeal to lots of people. It's dry and creamy in texture, with bright acidity framing citrus and tropical fruit, peach, mineral and vanilla flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay

"This linear red has attractive aromas of fragrant blue flower, red berry and chopped herb. The taut medium-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, red currant, white pepper and a note of dried sage alongside fine-grained tannins and bright acidity.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This is a pretty, luminous straw-colored sparkler with subtle shadings of honey, stone fruit, white flower and mineral. The wine is crisp and drying in the mouth but it also imparts a slight sensation of sweetness in the form of peach flavors.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"Delicate aromas of white stone fruit, ripe pear and white flower lead the nose while the bright palate offers crisp green apple, juicy white peach and a hint of bitter almond. Fresh acidity lifts the finish.",Italy-Lombardy-Turbiana
"This smells cheesy and tomatoey, with a woody accent. Clampy, resiny and drying on the palate, this has lean tea and cherry flavors that are complemented by a dull oak tone. The finish is minty and resiny tasting, but hollow in feel.",Spain-Central Spain-Tempranillo
"Noval has often in the past released a Vintage Port in years when other producers hold back. And, as in the past, the release is justified. For this is an impressive, dense and seriously age-worthy Port. While it has plenty of perfumed jammy red fruits and balanced acidity, it is the dark tannic character that will sustain this wine for decades. It could be drunk now for its fruit, although that would be a shame. Better to wait until 2030 and longer.",Portugal-Port-Port
"There's a slightly reductive barnyard funk on the nose of this blend of 53% Syrah, 34% Grenache and 13% Petite Sirah, as well as damp morel mushrooms and concentrated blackberries. It's tarry on the palate, with more blackberries in a slightly burned balsamic-reduction sauce.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"A good effort from a weak vintage. This Bierzo has sweet, rich, fulfilling aromas along with a soothing palate that's not overly acidic. As a whole, the wine's cola and blackberry flavors show themselves nicely, while the finish is chocolaty and long. A good wine from a sketchy year.",Spain-Northern Spain-Mencía
"Don't look for sunny California fruit in this wine. It's barely ripe, with green, gooseberry flavors barely breaking into nectarines. The aroma is marked by pyrazines, which give the wine a feline note. The finish is dry and tart in acidity.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
Looking for a medium-bodied Chardonnay with a citrusy edge? Look no further. Peach and lime scents ease into tropical fruit while retaining that zestiness on the finish. Drink now.,Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"Forest floor, ripe berry and cake spice aromas emerge in the glass. The structured palate doles out dried black cherry, blackberry, licorice, ground pepper and tobacco alongside assertive tannins that need time to unwind. Drink 2017–2021.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This wine's fruit is overripe, which spoils the structure that has been built around it.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine announces its modern intentions with polished opening notes of vanilla, caramel and coffee from aging in small French oak barrels. The intense palate shows cherry and boysenberry fruit which lead into a long, very complex finish. Will gain more complexity with a few years in the cellar but may be drunk now for the appeal of its youthful fruit.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"A simple Cabernet, the kind to drink at a party and not fuss. It's dry and smooth, with berry and herb flavors.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A terrific example of drink-now pleasure from the Barossa, this Shiraz deftly combines cedar and vanilla notes with dark fruit flavors. It's richly textured, with velvety tannins and crisp acids that frame the long finish. Drink now–2020.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"This bottling kicks off with a strikingly distinct aromatic profile recalling an elegant fruit punch, with hibiscus, raspberry sorbet, sour-cherry candy, sandalwood, incense and an underlying anise scent. Plump raspberry shows on the rounded red-fruit palate, with a minty, herbal touches of cedar and tobacco.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Leafy cassis and cocoa aromas and flavors carry hints of almond paste, saddle leather and ground cinnamon. The mouthfeel is full and plush, with ripe tannins that coat the mouth and let you know that this wine is about more than up-front fruit. Drink now or anytime over the next five years.",Chile-Curicó Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Attractive, fruity wine, with good tannins as well as stalky black currant fruit flavors. Its ripeness is a sign of the warm vintage.",France-Loire Valley-Cabernet Franc
"This Brut Prosecco opens with dry, almost dusty aromas of talc powder and crushed mineral followed by white flower and stone fruit. That dryness continues to the mouth and thanks to this unique quality, you could imagine a pairing with salty appetizers.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Firm and hard, this shows density rather than fruit, tannin rather than freshness. It goes for the dark side of Clos Vougeot. There is some bitterness from the extraction, but the wine needs many years before it comes into balance—the juicy red fruit finish promises richness later.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"A simple Merlot that's priced fairly and is a little tannic at first, the fruit acting shy, but that opens into a fine Merlot that would go well with rich red meat. .",US-California-Merlot
"Released quite young, this is a wine to decant. It's big and dark and tannic, tight as a tick, with grainy, textural tannins wrapped heavily around tart blue and purple berries. Though the flavors are pure Syrah, the structure and density are Cabernet-like, and though it's a guess, the odds are this is a wine to cellar for at least a decade.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Firm and structured, this is a dark still-young wine. With a strong tannic core, it is concentrated, the black fruits are firmly in the throes of the tannins. Give this impressively serious second wine of Haut-Brion time. Drink from 2022.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Light in color, this wine offers fresh but concentrated dark berry and cherry flavors and strong black tea and rose petal aspects. The acidity is moderate and supportive.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Dill, vanilla, tobacco, earth and light red-fruit aromas comprise the classic nose. The palate feels tight and in good shape, while a mild berry flavor comes topped with touches of cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg, expressing Rioja in every way. Elegant and balanced; drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"With its superb tannins, the wine has a great solid core of structure. Over it is an edifice of direct black berry fruits, elegant texture and intense acidity. Impressive, a wine for aging.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is vinified in steel and bottle aged. It's young and fresh, boasting bright red cherry and raspberry sensations along with notes of freshly tilled earth.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"An austere nose gives way in time to smoky tobacco, red currant and minerally acidity, the wine intense on the palate without being over the top. Along the way, hits of cedar and milk chocolate complement the proceedings.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Tarry, gamy aromas provide an intriguing entry into this bottling from pioneer Gary Eberle's winery, founded in 1982. The nose also conveys charred blueberries, thyme, rosemary and lavender. Leathery, rustic flavors show on the palate, alongside hints of boysenberry, cracked peppercorn and roasted venison.",US-California-Syrah
"If only this blend of seven popular varieties were drier, it would score higher. It's crisp in acidity and complex in orange, peach, pear, honeysuckle, vanilla and mineral flavors. But the sugary finish puts it into the fruit juice category.",US-California-White Blend
"This Cava is so heavily oaked that it smells savory and saucy, with almost no fruit to speak of. Woody flavors are barrel-dominated, and so is the monotonous finish.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Big, dark and brash, and very much in the modern California style, meaning it's rich, creamy, oaky and full-bodied. The nose brings toast, heat and potency, while the flavors are saturated, spicy and revolve around wild berry, tea, spice, caramel and savory warmth. Only gets better as it opens and airs; drink now through 2012.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir
"Mellow oak aromas work nicely with core apple and melon scents. This blend of Tempranillo Blanco and Viura feels tight and acidic, but also highly energetic. Flavors of light oak and generic citrus run long on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-White Blend
"The winery's first vineyard-designated Chardonnay, this comes from a vineyard in the Oak Knoll District AVA near Yountville, a relatively cooler area of the Napa Valley. Light golden in color, it offers pear and fig and is light in weight with a substantial finish of creamy vanilla.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The ethereal, aromatic lift of this wine is addictive. It appears like the sublimation of fresh, ripe apple. The dry, brisk palate adds streaks of lanolin and earthiness to that profound, glistening freshness and the distinctly phenolic texture. Drink and think. The wine will shine until at least 2025.",France-Alsace-Alsace white blend
"This Bordeaux-style blend is inky, reduced and heavily oaked up front, with aromas of sawdust, vanilla and jammy black fruits. Interestingly, it is somewhat sharp and shrill on the palate, with lively acidity. Flavors of raw oak, coconut, vanilla and blackberry finish savory and briny, with shearing acids and choppy tannins. Drink through 2019.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Feral strawberry grabs all the attention in this wildly fierce, high-acid wine that packs a punch in texture, tannin power and body. Small amounts of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah figure into the blend, which is made in minuscule amounts.",US-California-Grenache
"Classic and compelling aromas of rose petal, candied boysenberry, hibiscus reduction and vanilla brioche show on the nose of this wine from a rugged appellation east of the Salinas Valley. The firmly structured palate shows rose petals and tart berries, dusted by fennel pollen, white pepper and chaparral spice.",US-California-Grenache
"Ripe lemon, lime, grapefruit and tropical fruit flavors, touched with sweet, smoky oak, combine with brisk acidity to make this 100% Sauvignon Blanc instantly likeable. It has a touch of lemongrass and gooseberry that makes it savory.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Juicy and delicious, this has aromas of ripe orchard fruit and fragrant Spanish broom. The succulent palate doles out crisp Granny Smith apple, Anjou pear, nectarine and mineral alongside bright acidity.",Italy-Southern Italy-Greco
"Petit Chablis is planted on the plateau above the Serein river valley, the heart of Chablis. This attractively fruity wine offers white fruits and crisp acidity. Light and refreshing, it is ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Absolutely delicious, a fat, sumptuous wine that flatters the palate from beginning to end. Smells plush, brimming with currants and fancy oak trimmings, and turns lush and complex with fruit in the mouth. Best to drink it soon, in the fullness of youth.",US-California-Cabernet Blend
"This is a powerful wine, with intense scents of pineapple leading a lively interplay of citrus, stone, Asian pear and spices. Thrilling texture, balance and length make this a standout, even in this outstanding vintage for all Pinot Gris.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Barolo Gramolere offers an attractive window onto the Nebbiolo grape with peek views at its inherent complexity and elegance. The wine opens with a ruby-garnet color and offers aromas of wild berry, white cherry, tar, licorice, hazelnut and ginger.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Crisp and clean, with lemon-lime and lychee aromas that are typical and well presented. There's body to the wine but also streamlining acidity, resulting in a slick, smooth mouthfeel. Flavors of green melon, citrus and lychee are fresh and positive.",Argentina-Other-Torrontés
Apple and melon aromas are followed by medium-weight flavors. The concentration seems a bit watery in the midpalate but the variety is unmistakable and the balance is there.,US-Washington-Chardonnay
"This tight, stalky, still-young wine has a firm structure of tannins over the blackberry fruits. Wood aging has softened some of the harder edges and has also given the wine a chance to mature. Drink from 2017.",Portugal-Dão-Portuguese Red
"This wine is put together from multiple vineyard sources, including the well-known Morelli Lane and Widdoes, all farmed by the Duttons. Larger in production than many of the vineyard-designates, it offers baked bread and juicy overtones of cranberry-raspberry layered atop luxuriously toasted oak. It'll show well at the table.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Rose, iris, ripe red berry and aromatic herbs are some of the aromas you'll discover in this wine. It's both focused and juicy, delivering succulent Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, mint and licorice alongside a backbone of fined-grained tannins that leave a firm finish. Bright acidity provides balance. Drink 2023–2043.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This is a lightly style wine but extremely vivacious and sexy, with cut red apple, mandarin orange skin, ripe nectarine and lightly honeyed Gravenstein apple on the nose. It's clean, crisp and focused on the palate, where lime zest, limestone and a touch of buttered pear in the midpalate makes for a complete and balanced sip.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a soft, bland wine, with light fruit flavors, a creamy texture and a final tang of lemon zest. Drink now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese White
"A very rich Viognier, this has massive flavors of tropical fruit, peach, pear, vanilla bean and buttered toast. The ripe fruit comes at the cost of very high alcohol.",US-California-Viognier
"Fresh, clean and rather soft in balance, this shows easy-to-like aromas of pear and apple, slightly sweet flavors of honey and pear juice, and an almost syrupy, soft mouthfeel. It's agreeable and sweet.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Tastes highly confected, with strawberry and raspberry aromas and flavors that come across almost like bubble gum or cotton candy. Dissappointing.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"This velvety Vin Santo opens with intense maple syrup aromas that carry over to the palate along with apricot, orange peel, honey and spice. The dense, smooth texture is uplifted by fresh acidity that prevents it from being cloying.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This variety is a consistent strength for this winery. A warm vintage wine, it offers aromatic notes of freshly cut flowers, peach, creamsicle, pear and tangerine. It's textured in feel with abundant stone fruit and vanilla flavors that lead to a tart, apricot filled finish that lingers. The barrel influences play a big part but it works.",US-Washington-Viognier
"With vineyards in the south of the Mâcon region, this estate has produced a simple, fruity and ripe Bourgogne that shows apricot and peach flavors. It is light, direct and immediately easy to drink. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Deep ruby in color, this wine has a nose of black cherry and green bell pepper. The well-balanced flavor profile features notes of cherry, strawberry, smoked meat, Mediterranean herbs and eucalyptus. A network of generous tannins supports a persistent sensation of brightness on the side palate and smoky notes across the center of the tongue.",Israel-Judean Hills-Cabernet Sauvignon
"In this appellation blend from the single-vineyard-focused Los Gatos winery, aromas of cherry and chaparral scrub are pleasant if reluctant to emerge. The palate laces tart pomegranate and cranberry with licorice and forest-floor elements.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Toasty, caramelized oak dominates the aroma and flavor of this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend. It tastes soft and a little short of power.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This fruity wine has wood flavors that structure the bright red-berry note. It's an upfront wine, and it has a touch of minerality that gives depth to the tannins. Age this for 2–3 years.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
Exceptionally light feet make this delicate spätlese so quaffable. The palate juxtaposes pristine tangerine and peach flavors against savory notes of saffron and pollen and a high-pitched acidic backbone. It's ready to drink now but should hold well through 2020.,Germany-Rheinhessen-Riesling
"Kind of hard, pasty and candied on the nose, with a thick and chunky palate feel along with sweet, sugary, generic red fruit flavors. Hailing from Patagonia, this is a basic, creamy Cabernet with body and size but not too much character.",Argentina-Other-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Smooth, rich, round and packed with lush black cherry, raspberry, cedar, spice and cinnamon flavors. The tannins are silky, and the acidity is firm and bright. Slightly warm at the end.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Soft and ripe, smooth and creamy, this has a spicy element here the Pinot Gris in the blend, giving a piquancy to the white fruit flavor. It is warm, rounded and fragrant. Screwcap.",France-Alsace-White Blend
"Opens with funk and foxiness. In the mouth, it's sticky and a bit syrupy in feel, with sweet berry and cassis flavors. Settles down by the time it finishes, but overall it's less clean and pure than in past vintages. Contains six grapes: Syrah, Carmenère, Cabernet, Merlot, Malbec, Mourvèdre and Petit Verdot.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Red Blend
"So what's this California winery doing in Oregon? Making a nice little Pinot Noir for the masses. Connoisseurs will find it simple, but give Parducci a break. This is a good introduction to Pinot at a price everyone can afford.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Charbono is an old-fashioned grape that almost nobody makes anymore, but Shypoke is giving it some love, and good for them. This is a really nice wine. It's as full-bodied, dry and tannic as a Merlot, but with different flavors, of black cherries, grilled meats and mushu plum sauce, with dusty exotic spices and a touch of funky smoke. It's soft enough to drink now.",US-California-Charbono
"A soft, rather soapy wine, it displays light fruits and gentle tannins. It is unfocused, with just some juicy aftertaste to give some interest.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Jammy aromas and flavors that are as rich as maple syrup give a sweet accent to this full-bodied and mouth-filling wine. It has a touch of tannin for grip and finishes on the sweet side.,US-California-Pinot Noir
"The wine is rich—a beautiful blend dominated by Bandol's own Mourvèdre. The grapes gives both structure and a perfumed character to this ripe full wine. With acidity and layers of red fruits, it is worth aging. Drink from 2018.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Aromas of candied fruit, toasted oak, vanilla and a balsamic note lead the nose. The palate offers dried apple, dried apricot, almond and a honey note alongside soft acidity. It closes on a note of roasted coffee bean. The fruit is already fading so enjoy soon.",Italy-Southern Italy-Fiano
"This easygoing, generously fruity wine has candied fruit aromas, just enough tannin for balance and leaves a nice blackberry nuance on the finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Delicate mineral inflections lend elegance to flavors of pink grapefruit and peach on this sprightly semi-dry Riesling. Sunny with soft, Meyer-lemon acidity, it's a bit dainty on the palate but has enough power to drive a moderately long finish.",US-New York-Riesling
"This wine from the historic vineyard offers classic oaky aromas of smoke, butterscotch and salty roasted nuts. Smokiness lingers throughout the soft, excellently weighted palate that surrounds rich apple, nectarine and white peach flesh, with a citrus pith tension holding it together.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This opens with aromas of rose petal, lychee and pear. The intense slightly sweet palate delivers apricot jam, yellow peach and mango. It has nice length and finishes on an energizing mineral note.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Gewürztraminer
This demonstrates a fine balance between the crisp white and peach fruits and the nervy texture that keeps this feeling taut and sharp. Beneath the fruity surface there is structure and a mineral character. Age for another 2–3 years.,France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Chunky cherry, cough drop and dusty aromas make for a ripe but alluring nose. This feels big and full, as will most 2012 Chilean Pinot Noirs; flavors of baked black fruits and raspberry are about as rich and sweet as Pinot should ever get, while a smooth, chocolaty finish is modest in terms of acidity.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Pinot Noir
"Dried hayflowers and dried orange peel send a lifted scent. The palate is richer and rounder than the nose suggests, full of ample apple and pear fruit, but guided and held by fresh, clean acidity. A certain earthiness shimmers with almost tropical hints of mango. The finish is dry, briskly clean but very lingering.",France-Alsace-Alsace white blend
"About half Cabernet, the rest a Bordeaux mix, this opens nicely with forward plum and cherry fruit. There are notes of savory herbs in the nose, but the wine turns astringent and the finish a little chalky and stemmy.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"One of the top Vouvray sparkling wines, this 2012 is still young. That gives it almond, quince and pear flavors along with intense bright acidity. It is still missing the richer, toasty character that will come with age. Drink from 2016.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"Although this seems initially austere, it has some fruit weight. Its tannins are dry and firm but will soften with time, showing potential for long, slow aging. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Ripe pear on nose and palate is the central theme on this broad-shouldered and richly textured wine. A dollop of sweetness is countered with fresh lime acidity that concludes in ripe accord.,France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"A lively Cabernet Sauvignon with dark extraction and intense aromas of blackberry, plum, dark chocolate, cola and tar. The wine is dense and thick, but not heavy at all. In fact, it boasts bright acidity and refreshing fruit flavors.",Italy-Tuscany-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Crisp and lacy, this is a fine successor to the 2006 Riesling from A to Z. Once again, it sets up the palate for spicy fare with bracing acids and scents of citrus skins. Flavors emphasize citrus rind and spice, fill in the middle with jicama and spicy pear, then finish with a lick of minerality.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"This is an attractive, fruity, fresh rosé. It is dry but balances acidity and fruitiness with its sweet strawberry fruit and light touch of vanilla pod. Drink now.",Portugal-Tejo-Rosé
"This 100% varietal wine offers very primary, focused aromas of blackberry, black licorice, cocoa and black cherry. It's full in feel, with abundant dark fruit flavors supported by lightly dry tannins. Give it time to all come together. Best after 2020.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A dated but not outdated blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Mourvedre, Cabernet Franc, and Sangiovese that brings notes of herbs, green beans, and floral notes. It's rich and sweet with plump fruit flavors and dry tannins.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Smells a bit oily and heavy, with sweet tropical fruit aromas leading the charge. The palate is creamy and oily feeling, with honey, nutmeg, banana and melon flavors. Fleshy on the finish; best if taken well chilled.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Torrontés
"While this wine does not age in wood, it does age on its lees, giving it a rich, creamy texture. It's smooth, full and soft, its apricot and peach flavors showing ripeness and openness. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Aged in white oak barrels from Minnesota, the winemaker's home state, this wine offers exotic honeysuckle and baked pineapple at its core, beautiful aromas that gain weight on the texture. Toasted caramel and coconut define the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is not a wine for tonight, or next year, or for at least the next six years. It's shut down in tannins, with an astringency that can't be overcome even with decanting, although that won't stop people from opening it before its time. Buried beneath the tannins are well-developed black currant, roasted meat and cedar flavors that define upscale Napa Cab. Really fine and distinguished, a wine to cellar and enjoy for many years.",US-California-Red Blend
"High-toned citrus stars in this mineral-driven wine that harmonizes acidity and fruit. Lime and grapefruit lean into richer elements of vanilla and caramel on the finish, balancing each other out.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Here's a big, rich, densely layered Syrah, the kind of wine that Cab or Merlot lovers who are looking for alternatives should discover. It's full-bodied, dry and oaky, yet with its cherry, chocolate, fig and licorice flavors, offers a whole different flavor profile. Brilliiant with pork tenderloin with a fruity sauce or stuffing.",US-California-Syrah
"This wine is well poised between structure and fresh red fruits. A dark side of firm tannins gives a dry core to the wine, while the bright red-berry fruit is perfumed and fresh. The two elements are integrating well. Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Raw, herbaceous aromas of green-infused berry fruits are stripped back and less than appealing, making this wine feel rough. Flavors of plum and berry are highly herbal and flat out green on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinto Fino
"Mineral, mulberry, dried herb and black-fruit aromas lead to layered dark-fruit flavors that show intensity as well as exceptional balance. This has a delicious factor that is impossible to ignore.",US-Washington-Syrah
"A vineyard selection is used to make this powerful, super ripe wine. With its opulent flavors, it is as densely packed with fruit as it is with tannins. Balanced and gorgeous, this is ready to drink now, yet it will age over several years.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"A wonderfully balanced wine, this shows a vanilla note that harmonizes with its ripe tropical fruit and a distinct touch of minerality. Wood aging shows through on the finish.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"This concentrated and fruity red blend has effusive black-cherry aromas, ripe black-plum flavors and a slight sweetness that makes the texture smooth and soft.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"An attractive, red-fruited wine, lightweight with acidity and smoothed with wood. It is fresh, with coffee and black cherry flavors, now ready to drink.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Stainless-steel fermented, this white is grassy and pea-like. A simple thickness on the palate is offset somewhat by a tang of grapefruit.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

"Delicate aromas of lemon chiffon, green banana and mineral give this the opening you'd want. The palate is ripe and bold, but also limited to green-apple flavors. Healthy in the mouth, with a zesty, correct finish. This wine gets things right while not making a big statement. Imported by Republic National Distributing Co.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"The balance between ripeness and acidity that is the hallmark of this fine vintage is expressed well in this impressive wine. Tangy, with a strong streak of minerality, it is crisp and rich at the same time. For its fruitiness, it is ready to drink; for more maturity, it will need to age until 2018.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Aromas of toasted oak, dark berry and menthol lead the way. The firm palate offers bright red cherry, strawberry, thyme and sage alongside tightly knit tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Savory pepper and rustic gravel aromas meet with strawberry and dried cherry on the nose of this proprietary red blend that is widely available. Strawberry pie flavors dominate the sip, but there's also a lava rock minerality and a burst of acidity.",US-California-Red Blend
"The bouquet is dry, briney and otherwise neutral. It feels wide and lemony, with flavors of citrus and white fruits. It remains mildly pickled on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"This blend of 90% Syrah and 10% Grenache offers plum, blackberry and blueberry on the nose with sweet cedar, tobacco and vanilla spice touches. There is strong acidity through the sip, which delivers similar elements as the nose, with baked black-purple fruit and clove spice.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Burgundian technique was used in this wine, and the aromas and tastes of those techniques dominate. The wine is heavy in leesy, yeasty, toasted oak notes, which dominate, rather than subtlely support, the underlying fruit.",US-California-Chardonnay
Freshness is the calling card here. This wine is so crystalline-clear with palate-cleansing minerality that it's irresistible. Green apples and light citrus flavors combine in a stylish effort made for near-term enjoyment.,US-Oregon-Pinot Blanc
"Big and flavorful, this full-bodied wine boasts butter, toast and smoke nuances layered over ripe pear and marzipan flavors. Fermented in stainless steel but aged in French oak, it has a rich texture and overt sweetness without going to extremes.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Made from a blend of Sangiovese (85%) and Merlot (15%), this Morellino discloses aromas of incense and exotic Asian spices together with toasted oak. The palate shows raspberry and plum layered with espresso and coffee alongside astringent tannins. It closes on a bitter, drying note.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This Carmel Valley-based winery has modernized its label without losing its classic appeal. It's reserved on the nose at first, with tightly wound seared lemon peel, Gravenstein apple and marmalade aromas. Rounded lemon curd, browned butter and orange cream flavors show on the palate, with a strong honeysuckle element and a caramelized finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Damp earth, subtle berry, plum and smoke notes define the nose. It feels typically tannic and clampy for Ribera del Duero, with leathery, roasted flavors of blackberry, rubber and herbs.

This interplay between baroque and discipline continues, creating a scintillating experience. Enjoy the ride and marvel at all the spicy overtones.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"A solid and appealing large-format wine that is 60% Malbec and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is composed and shows honest aromas of blackberry and cassis. It's juicy and fresh in the mouth, with decent berry fruit but not much in the way of trimmings, i.e. oak, tannins, depth or length. Still, for value hunters it'll get the job done.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine seems to be quickly maturing. Scents of rose petals and cherries carry over into similar flavors, punctuated with a light dusting of cocoa powder. There's ample acidity, and the wine is completely ready for near-term drinking.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Sparkling wine specialist Schramsberg ventures out to the Fort Ross area to tinker with Pinot Noir under its Davies brand. This shows intensity and concentration, with powerful raspberry and cherry essences that are compounded by sweet-tasting, smoky oak. Impressive now, but it should gain traction in the bottle over the next four years.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"There's a green mint and gooseberry edge to this 100% Viognier. While it lacks the variety's characteristic opulence, it's elegantly dry and crisp with ripe peach and tropical fruit flavors.",US-California-Viognier
"This extreme-coastal vineyard bottling shows fresh, expressive yet diligently restrained aromas of Key-lime pith, scratched tangerine, wet chalk, Meyer lemons and a touch of dairy. Tongue-tingling acidity starts the sip, followed by sea salt, warm Marcona almonds, toasted sunflower seeds, a flinty minerality and citrus oil toward the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Exuberant floral tones persist from nose to finish in this luminously sweet Riesling. It's feather light on the palate, yet pineapple and mango flavors are unctuous and concentrated. A spray of tangerine acidity extends the finish endlessly.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Here is a simple but tasty Chard, offering attractive notes of pear, spiced orange and toasted apple skin on the nose and mouth. It's light weight and well balanced, with ample acidity and a short but clean finish. Enjoy now.",France-France Other-Chardonnay
"Firm and bright, this is a full-bodied, generously layered red rich in red currant, tobacco, clove and black pepper. Lengthy and complexly woven, it has a gravelly edge of minerality to its texture and taste.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Syrupy and fruity, with flavors of peach and apple juice, spearmint and guava. The full-throttle flavors finish a little sweet, and the acid is low.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is one of a pair of premium off-dry Champagnes that are distinctive and bold. There is a tannic edge to this wine as well as plenty of red fruitiness and acidity. Because it is only just off dry, it will make a great pairing with savory spicy dishes.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Perfumed like a summer garden, this wine is spicy and oaky, offering a wealth of cardamom and cola. Dark cherry, cranberry, orange and rhubarb vie for a balance between tart and succulent, the acidity ruling the day in the end.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Produced from a 7-acre parcel within the premier cru, this wine is tight and nervy at this young stage. It has acidity, a tangy mineral texture and crisp white and citrus fruit but needs time to fill out and show its full potential. Drink from 2021.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This popular vineyard, now almost 20 years old, yields a brambly Pinot Noir which might pass for a Sonoma Coast bottling. More elegant, almost steely, than many of the other Soléna vineyard designates, this offers cooler fruit flavors of rhubarb and wild strawberry, along with anise and dried herb.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"As sweet as a cream puff, with marshmallow, lemon custard and vanilla flavors. Think of it as a decent dessert wine and drink accordingly.",US-California-Chenin Blanc
"Soft Honeycomb cereal, toasted apple skin and pear lead the nose of this accessible wine, with pleasant hints of fresh herbs. The palate is clean and light on its feet, with vibrant acidity that kicks up the ripe apple, orange and white melon flavors. Drink this balanced beauty now.",South Africa-Western Cape-Chenin Blanc
"Sweet on the nose, with a lot of mocha, vanilla and candied fruit. The palate is tannic and very oaky for a wine of this level. Flavors of toffee, cocoa, mocha and generic berry fruit show more oak than purity. A good wine but heavy handed with the oak. Contains 15% Syrah.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Smoky char, dried herb, cedar and cherry with plum adorn this full-figured concentrated wine, which shows a touch of heat on the palate. From a site at 1,500-feet in elevation, and blended with 5% Petite Sirah, it mellows well in the glass.",US-California-Zinfandel
"The Treehouse spent 18 months in 15% new French oak, and has light flavors of cherry and root beer. The tannins are earthy with astringent, green tea flavors, and a hint of stem in the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Firm and structured, this wine has strong wood-aging spice and ripe tannins. The fruit is suppressed by the toasty wood flavors, but it holds hints of black currant fruitiness for the future. Drink from 2015.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Piquant aromas of cinnamon meet with strawberry, plum, gravel and bay leaf on the nose of this appellation blend by Steve Dooley. That bay leaf joins eucalyptus on the very clean and fresh sip, which surrounds tart raspberry, vanilla and clove flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"At nearly four years of age, this Pinot is in an awkward phase. Tasted in March, it was dry, tannic and oaky, with powerful red fruit and mocha flavors. There's a distinctly funky, animal note that lends interest. Hold until 2015 or so.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Despite having several years in bottle, this Malbec opens with a huge blast of charred oak, shoe polish, lemon peel and rooty berry aromas. The palate is clipped and linear in feel, while flavors of coconut, vanilla and generic berry finish with lasting coconut and unsettled oak.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Aromas of French oak and coconut lead the nose. Oak carries over to the lean, bracing palate where you'll also detect raw sour cherry. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak while raspy tannins leave an astringent, mouth puckering finish.",Italy-Central Italy-Montepulciano
"Dull and cidery, with mealy apple aromas and similar flavors. Offers almost nothing besides a pale straw color, generic white fruit and corny side notes.",Chile-Central Valley-Chardonnay
"This big, powerful wine is full of rich white and citrus fruits that are laced with spice and pepper. The wine is full bodied and intensely ripe, with the roundness contrasting with a tangy, mineral edge. Drink from 2015. Screwcap.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"Refreshing on the nose, this clonal study shows lively and tropical aromas of Asian pear, guava, Meyer-lemon skin and that characteristic grassy note. It's racy on the palate, where green-apple rinds meet with lime skins, cement and crushed white rocks.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine has intense acidity along with red fruits, showing the freshness of the year. A smoky, burnt character from the wood aging needs to integrate, with a youthful crispness that needs to soften. Drink from 2020.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This substantial wine is full bodied, robust in flavor and firmly textured due to ample fine-grained tannins. The fruit flavors are tempting and ripe, while accents of black pepper and dried herbs add complexity.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Typical varietal aromas of lychee, citrus and white flowers feed into a juicy palate that's tight and tangy in feel. Lychee, pineapple and mango flavors hold form on the finish before showing a slight bit of pith and bitterness at the end. Drink now.",Argentina-Other-Torrontés
"When first opened it is tight and herbal, with the scent of blood. But the subtle hints of rock and spice that underlie the pristine cranberry fruit need some years to unwrap themselves. This new 2006 Schindler comes out swinging, its wild berry fruit laced with earthy, barnyard funk. Tastes like an unbridled mix of fruit and soil, spice and barrel, that adds up to a vibrant, earthy, alive Pinot.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A little burnt and rubbery on the nose, but with enough lemon and apple to balance things out. The palate is fleshy and soft, with banana and lemon as the lead flavors. Shows a bit of pithy bitterness late, but overall it's good if you like sweet, warm Chardonnays.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"Tasted twice, with divergent results; the 86 rating reflects the average of both bottles. One bottle seemed overly heavy, with an odd mix of jalapeño peppers and honey. The better (and hopefully more representative) bottle showed richness without excessive weight, hints of cream and toast and penetrating citrus flavors, and would have rated 89 points on its own.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"The variety is unmistakable, with notes of dried herb, dark cherry and espresso. The jammy fruit flavors are rich, with lightly grainy tannins and coffee notes on the finish. It shows a fine sense of balance.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Full bodied and fruity, the 2010 estate Syrah from Va Piano is rounder and less herbal than the 2009. Which style you enjoy is a matter of individual preference. Big and approachable, with lovely blueberry fruit, the 2010 seems to stop a bit short, but with more bottle age may reveal details that are currently in hiding.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Bone dry, minerally and brisk in mouthwatering acidity, this has subtle yet rich flavors of tropical fruit, citrus, green apple and honey. It shows real elegance and complexity; drink now–2016.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this opens with delicate aromas of woodland berry, apple, Alpine herb and a whiff of bread crust. The creamy palate offers cherry, strawberry, candied nectarine zest and a note of baking spice alongside a soft, persistent perlage.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Nero
"Savory notes of nuts and grains stand out against a backdrop of fresh white grapefruit, apple and lemon in this semidry Riesling. Crisp lime acidity lends refreshment to the finish. Drink now.",US-New York-Riesling
"A ripe wine that has red-berry fruits, slices of black plum and a full deck of tannins. It is concentrated and ripe, full of fruit and equally full of structure. Let the two soften and drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Here's an earthy red that opens with aromas suggesting smoke, tilled soil and leather. The solid, straightforward palate offers mature plum and a hint of almond alongside rather grainy, astringent tannins. Drink through 2017.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Lagrein
"A pretty good Chardonnay. Its a little pineapple juicy, and the oak is pretty strong, but a streak of minerality and crisp, clean acidity give just enough structure.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The wine is bone-dry with acidity as well as fragrant fruitiness. Because it comes from the south of Champagne, it has enough ripe fruit to sustain and balance this really dry character. It's ready to drink, although holding until late 2015 will help it even more.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This single-vineyard wine offers high-toned citrus, almond and vanilla bean flavors. Fresh and fruity, it's light  bodied yet doesn't skimp on flavor or texture, finishing on a tart note of lemon pith.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Quite a steal for lovers of this variety, this wine shows green apple, kiwi, chalk and a sharp lime-peel edge on the nose. The palate offers flavors of grapefruit and Key lime wedges, but the real winning aspects are the white pepper spice and the rain-on-cement minerality.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"A kitchen sink blend of white grapes, it comes together with interesting if slightly disjointed effects. There is honey and slight buttercream on the nose (likely from the Chardonnay lead). Once sipped, lush fruit comes to the fore, characterized by caramelized pear (probably the Viognier). On top of that, there is tangy acidity and slight tarriness.",US-California-White Blend
"This is a serious, impressive wine. Fermented in open stone tanks and wood aged, it has a rich texture that encompasses the ripe black fruits and the spicy tannins. The wine has real depth and concentration with a firm, dense structure that will allow it to age. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Avoids the variety's opulent, often sweet side in favor of a leaner, drier, more elegant style. It has the weight and texture of a Sauvignon Blanc, yet offers rich but subtle tropical fruit, white flower and mineral flavors, with a smack of sweet oak. This is a complex wine, and you don't want to drink it too cold.",US-California-Viognier
"At first the aroma is sharp, even clumsy, showing herbs, peanuts and even bacon fat. The fruit is in the big-plum range. A heavy dose of oak has been thrown at this wine, so it’s buttery on the palate and coffee-tinged on the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Production has doubled and the price has risen in this latest vintage, but Portlandia has yet to land on a consistent identity for its Pinot Gris. This shows apple and pear fruit, showing more than a touch of skin contact flavors, with some bitterness drifting through the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"This is one of the drier, more structured Merlots from any Napa appellation in recent memory. Far from being a soft, gooey fruit bomb, its marked by big-time tannins, with herb, leather, olive tapenade, cherry and dark unsweetened chocolate flavors. It might strike fruit fans as austere, but true aficionados will recognize a great mountain wine of enormous complexity.",US-California-Merlot
"The aromas are light, with notes of baking spice and black and blue fruit. Tart cherry flavors linger on the finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Aromas of dark berry steeped in spirits, baking spice, crushed flower, mocha, eucalyptus and pipe tobacco come together on this stunning wine. The firm palate boasts more fruit than many from this vintage, delivering juicy dark cherry, ripe raspberry, vanilla, cake spice and licorice alongside firm but refined tannins and bright acidity. It's youthfully assertive but balanced, with serious aging potential. Drink 2021–2041.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Staete Landt's upscale Pinot Noir eschews dark color and extraction in favor of lighter body and soft tannins. Leather, cranberry and cocoa aromas lead the way, followed on the palate by a pie cherry note and a slightly medicinal green-herb edge. Tart and long on the finish, this wine appears to have the potential to mature gracefully through 2020.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"Made to drink young, this fruity, softly structured wine is ripe with blackberry fruits. There is a touch of spice from the wood aging and a lining of attractive acidity. Drink now.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red

"From an estate vineyard site run by one of the region's finest farmers, this Pinot is intense and vibrant in juicy red cherry and raspberry, with earthiness at its core. Exuberant and robust on the palate, it puts its time in oak on full display, and finishes light and bright.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Twomey has turned to various coastal sources for Pinot Noir for years, with mixed results. Finally, with this Bien Nacido bottling, they've found something worth repeating. It shows that vineyard's balanced structure, with fine acidity and tannins framing cherry, red currant and cola flavors laced with minerality.",US-California-Pinot Noir
This is an easy drinking Cabernet tasting of red cherry and cranberry with a slight layer of herb that would suffice for a midweek meal.,US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe yellow apple, Bartlett pear and toasted bread crust aromas follow through to the elegant palate along with flint and a hazelnut note. Small persistent beads and fresh acidity brighten the creamy flavors.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sparkling Blend
"This opens with tropical fruit aromas of pineapple, mango and melon that are framed by hints of honeysuckle and sweet spice. The medium-weight palate boasts similar tropical fruit tones, but with an assertive mineral and lime-zest lift on the close, ending fresh and lively. Drink up.",South Africa-Robertson-Chardonnay
"Acidity and minerality lend this Chardonnay a distinctive personality. The cool vintage has given it a certain lean appeal, but that's not to minimize the tropical fruit and sweet oak that give it richness. It's sleek, stylish and moderate in alcohol.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Aromas of vanilla, clove, coffee and dark raspberry lead to a mouthful of rich layered fruit flavors. It shows impressive concentration, with fruit flavors lingering on the long finish.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Pure notes of russet pear rise from the glass with their wonderful combination of juicy ripeness and moreish freshness. The palate does these aromas justice and follows with fruit-driven full freshness of pear and lemon. The body is slender and zippy, the finish is clean and dry.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"This wine needs food so much, it practically cries out loud for it. It's like the essence of lemons and grapefruits, in a bone-dry, crisply tart package that makes the taste buds sing. The oak has been kept in the background to emphasize the clean, racy flavors, although partial sur-lie aging adds creamy notes. Oysters and this wine would be a marriage made in heaven.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This pure Cabernet blends first-class fruit from Loess, Windrow and Cold Creek. It's spicy and tight, with black cherry fruit at the core. It's back-loaded with toast and caramel flavors from aging in a mix of French and American oak.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Veins of smoke and petrol thread through layers of pressed apple, pear and tangerine in this sprightly semi-dry Riesling. It's a delicately concentrated wine but bolstered by crisp lemon acidity and touches of bramble and spice. Drink now through 2019.",US-New York-Riesling
"From a base of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon this robust red adds Petit Verdot, Merlot and Malbec to concoct a soft, smooth and juicy red wine that's brooding in personality. The tannins are tar-like and sizable.",US-California-Red Blend
"From one of the properties followed by the Marmande cooperative at the northern end of the Southwest region, this wine has black currant fruits that are filled out with some firm tannins. After five years, it is obvious that the tannins will remain, leaving a wine that is dry and stalky in character.",France-Southwest France-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Low intensity fruit and floral aromas are hidden in the bouquet, with minor suggestions of strawberry hull and crushed carnation to be found only upon deep nosing. Light and easy in the mouth with a short but clean finish.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rosé
"After starting out reduced, this cool-vintage blend of Merlot (43%), Cabernet Franc (32%), Malbec (33%) and Mourvèdre offers cranberry, herbs and chocolate. It's soft and easy drinking—a surprise given the structure often seen in this appellation—with chocolate and cherry flavors taking the lead.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This subtle, graceful Syrah acknowledges the cool vintage and takes full advantage of what it has to offer. It's based upon elegantly-layered citrus and sappy berry fruit flavors, with just a delicate hint of clean earth.",US-Washington-Syrah
Not an abundance of fruit here but the nose does show some nice minerality while a few gooseberry hints emerge in the mouth. The palate is on the watery side but is redeemed by some nice pear character that lingers on the finish. Drink up.,US-New York-Merlot
Tart cranberry and raspberry fruit comes with a touch of caramel coffee. It's medium bodied and should be consumed within the next two or three years.,US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This blend of the very local Petit Courbu and Petit Manseng grapes comes from the same region as Madiran. The wine is dry but rich—very rich—with apricot and honey flavors. It has concentration, a great tang of lemon and just enough acidity to keep everything in order. This is ready to drink.",France-Southwest France-White Blend
"Earthy game, truffle, underbrush, used leather and dark-skinned fruit aromas lead the nose. They carry over to the taut, tightly wound palate, where austere, dusty tannins leave a drying finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A very good Cabernet, although a young one. It's classically structured, with fine tannins and acidity framing ripe, luxurious flavors of blackberries, black currants and cocoa, accentuated by smoky oak. Good now, with decanting, but should be better by late 2010.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This elegant sparkler has a lot going for it, from the complex aromas of bread dough and thyme to flavors of lemon and lime. Made from organically grown Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grapes, it offers a very clean and fresh personality and crisp and tangy texture.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Creamy on the nose with a scent of musk and flowers, this wine from Brotherhood is too angular to fully enjoy. The acidity is good but the overall flavors are lean.",US-New York-Riesling
"Smoky flavor envelops a soft supple layering of blackberry and cherry in this wine, that's big, broad and full of heat. A sweetness of oak provokes the fruit.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Maturing well, this ripe red-berry flavored wine is soft and rounded. It has just a hint of tannins and wood along with generous ripe fruitiness. The wine is full bodied, likely to be ready to drink from 2018.",France-Loire Valley-Pinot Noir
"Under the Feather label, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon styled by Napa's Randy Dunn s the only one pure varietal red wine in the Long Shadows collection. Eucalyptus aromas rise instantly as it's poured, leading into a smooth, appealing flavors of plum and cassis fruit. It fades rather quickly, even after being open for a few hours, leaving just an impression of chocolate from the barrel aging. It lacks the heft of past vintages.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon

The palate is fresh with lime and toasted coconut flavors, held up by a backbone of strong acid that keeps it from spilling toward overripe qualities.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Produced from Henry Fessy's own cru vineyards, the wine is fruity and very accessible to drink young. Generous berry fruits and soft tannins make this an attractive wine. The aftertaste brings in light acidity. Drink now.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"As with the winery's Blue Chip bottling, this seems to be approaching an early maturity. Slightly grainy flavors of brown sugar and maple syrup wrap around light cherry candy. The finish is threaded with coffee and butterscotch. This is a wine to enjoy sooner rather than later.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Enticing scents of blue flower, plum, blackberry and dried herb come together on this. The fresh, chewy palate offers dried black cherry, anise and tobacco set against a backbone of assertive tannins and zesty acidity.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Aggressive on the palate, this has harp acids that frame flavors of sour cherry candy and green mint.",US-California-Merlot
"Creamy aromas predominate on the nose and carry through to a round, rich palate. This is generous, full and bready, with a lot of earthy flavors on the midpalate. While there is balance, there is little fruit and lots of yeasty character.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend

"Just beautiful and oh, so refreshing. The cool vintage has resulted in a high-acid wine of enormous fruit, bursting with intense, classic Edna Valley flavors of limes, kiwis, Meyer lemons, honeysuckle and minerals. The vanilla spice and creamy smoke have got to come from the terroir, because the wine never saw a splinter of oak.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A fruity wine, made to be drunk young, ripe and forward. It has bold tannins as well as ripe berry fruits and soft acidity. Certainly drink now, but better age for 2–3 years.",France-Southwest France-Malbec-Merlot

"One sip is all it takes to love this wine, if you're a Zinfandel fan. It's bone dry, silky in texture and spicy, with brambly, briary flavors of wild forest berries, red currants, tobacco and beef jerky.

"Seductive perfume suggest fronds of jasmine, ivy, mandarin and perhaps an edge of pink grapefruit. The playfulness of this citrus feast fizzes away and excites both nose and palate. It has all the effortlessness that comes with years of practice.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"Napa red wine hardly gets more delicious than this. It's so soft and velvety, so rich in chocolate, blackberry and smoky oak flavors, that you can't resist sip after sip.

"For the first time this reserve-level Gamache Cabernet includes grapes from the Ciel du Cheval vineyard as well as both the Champoux and estate vineyards. It's 100% varietal, drawing upon equal portions of fruit from all three, and it's a magnificent combination.

Highlights of black tea, espresso and smoke add layers of interest to a lengthy finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon

The palate clings close to the lime, lemon and pink grapefruit pith flavors that open a little toward apple flesh and a pinch of herbs.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Among Chilean Chardonnays, this one gets it more right than wrong. The nose deals apple pie and mineral, while the palate shows mostly apple, pear and butterscotch flavors. Not complex or stately, but round, fresh and generally on target.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay

"This is ripe, almost too ripe, with its broad red fruits and soft tannins. The texture is smooth, with a burst of acidity. It's ready to drink now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Exceptionally delicious to drink now, this is rich, vibrant and complex. It offers wave after wave of raspberry and cherry pie filling, rose tea, mineral and smoky sandalwood flavors, which are all wrapped into an incredibly fine texture of complex tannins and vibrant acids. The finish is dry and graceful. It's tough to keep your hands off of this wine, but it should hold in the bottle for 6–8 years, gradually losing fruit and gaining earthy, mushroomy complexities.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Extraordinarily rich and ripe, this unique Cabernet-based blend contains 30% Syrah. It's a dramatic wine, marked by a near-perfect tannin structure and massive, long-lasting flavors of blackberries, black currants, chocolate, licorice, candied violets, sweet leather, peppery spices and smoky sandalwood. Marked by youthful primary fruit now, it needs time to knit together. Give it until after 2012 to come around, and should develop for many years after.",US-California-Red Blend

Oregano, thyme, sage, bay leaf and black pepper power the palate, where boysenberry fruit and pencil lead complete the fresh but layered experience.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

Drink 2015–2022.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Zin doesn't get bigger or riper than this. Floods the mouth with flamboyant blackberries, cherries, currants, cola, black pepper, anise and sandalwood.

"This wine is clearly shooting for the modern style of Rioja; it's dark as night, soft and meaty. But it also has a lot of gaseous sulfur on the nose and hard tannins.

"Shows This wine boasts Petite Sirah's full-bodied mouthfeel, with fuzzy tannins framing ripe, jammy blackberries, cherries and chocolate. The alcohol is high, but that's Petite Sirah for you, giving it a warmth that asks to be paired with barbecue.

The structure is a little too soft and weak to support all this weight, though. Drink now.",US-California-Red Blend

"This stylishly labeled wine by Adam Lazarre and Christian Tietje shows salted apples, lime blossoms and white flowers on the nose.

"This supple, medium-bodied wine packs in many of the notes that make Syrah from the Northern Rhône so compelling: coffee, tar, leather, black olive, chocolate and roasted meat, all backed by raspberry-cherry fruit. Enjoy the ride over the next several years.",France-Rhône Valley-Syrah
"That this small-lot Lodi producer has ventured out to the Russian River Valley for Zinfandel says something here and it says it with finesse, this being austere for Zin, not jammy, with enviable structure and a nice lift of black cherry, spicy cola and earth at the end.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This bottling has turned out to be one of California's more important Merlot releases. The '05, like its immediate predecessors, is a dry, richly tannic wine of great elegance and structural complexity. It pleases now for the wealth of black currants, anise, herbs, spices and smoky oak, and should develop bottle nuances through 2011.",US-California-Merlot
"At first this smells like plastic and sweet black fruits mixed with chocolate. The palate feels heavy and raw, while flavors of muddled yet tart plum and berry finish big, minty and slightly green.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"An odd, one-dimensional white that's simple in execution, style and taste.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Tropical stone fruit and wild honey rise from the nose of this exquisite white wine, from a spot smack in the middle of the appellation. High-toned citrus lifts the acidity to refreshing, supporting levels, a mix of Meyer lemon and limestone-like stoniness. A lean, lithe underbelly underlies a heart of apple pie and baked pineapple.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A light, easy Pinot Blanc, rounded, creamy and with just the right balance of fresh acidity. It's simple, attractive now, ready to drink.",France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"This generously proportioned wine offers brambly red raspberry and almond paste, especially on the nose. Buoyant acidity saves it from becoming overblown on the palate, balancing the ripe fruit with a smooth, soft and crisp palate.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Although known in the Douro as an increasingly essential component of Port and table wines, the Touriga Nacional is equally at home in the Dão. As here, it produces linear wines, very mineral, full of acidity with a perfumed elegance. This is a wine for aging over 4–5 years.",Portugal-Dão-Touriga Nacional
"Aromas of violet and red currant waft from the glass. The fresh, juicy palate delivers wild cherry, strawberry and an herbal note alongside bright acidity and soft tannins. It finishes with an almond accent.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Schiava
"An enticing mix of toast and white fruit aromas follows through to rich apricot and ripe pear flavors, spiced with the creamy toast. The wood does need to calm down for the wine to be at its best.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This wine comes out of the bottle a little cranky, but give it some time in the glass and the initial stink gives way to notes of lime, apple and peach. It's plump in feel, with some dusty minerality and dried spices adding nuance to the sweet fruit.",Germany-Mosel-Saar-Ruwer-Riesling

"This under-$30 wine is perfect for either a weeknight dinner or special event. Round blackberry and black currant fruit pairs with fresh floral and forest floor notes on the nose. Dried black fruit shows on the palate, where concentrated coffee, dill, tar and crushed slate flavors cut through plum skin tang.",US-California-Syrah
"Still spritzy, very tart and tangy, with orange peel and lemon drop flavors. Perhaps showing just a bit more intensity than the 2006, this is a terrific follow-up with the same mix of delicacy and power that suggests that the Columbia Gorge AVA may well be the best site in the Pacific Northwest to grow Riesling.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Grapefruit peel and tart lemon combine for a memorably savory beginning to this crisp wine. This one integrates its acidity with a medium weight into a clean, dry and lengthy package of flavor and bite.",US-California-Rosé
"Bottled at four years old, this wine has retained all its fruitiness. Bright plum flavors go with the dusty tannins and sweetness to create a generous wine with plenty of room for fruit acidity. Drink now, but the wine could age a couple of years.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Gorgeous balsam wood and graphite aromas blend seamlessly with ripe berry and black coffee scents. It feels lively yet cushioned, tasting like a wicked brew of maple, tobacco, berry pie and fine wood shavings. This is smooth, long and comfortable on the tobacco- and resin-flavored finish. Drink now–2018.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"An easy drinking, lightly colored wine, it offers bright red fruit, white pepper and a bit of green pepper on the nose. These are followed by cranberry, cherry and strawberry on the palate, bolstered by a pinch of green herbs. Often served slightly chilled, it's best served alongside Argentinian barbecue on the polo field—such as the Happy Canyon one owned by the brand's founder Thomas Barrack.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Every kind of pepper, from green to red to jalapeño, is present on the nose, along with red plum and spice aromas. Feels tight and zesty, with Italian-leaning flavors of tomato, oregano and basil along with cassis and strawberry. Crisp and agile on the finish, but tastes green.",Argentina-Other-Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's a soapy, fragrant quality to this brut sparkling wine that is backed by slightly muddled aromas of simple citrus and peach. It's perfect for very informal drinking occasions.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"This Cabernet has rich blackberry-jam and black licorice flavors, and it also has a funky bacon note. The oak provides a pleasant backdrop of sweet toast. This shows how well Cabernet can perform on the far Sonoma Coast, which is now  more oriented to Pinot Noir.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A perennial Best Buy, Sangre de Toro always delivers a quality red-wine experience that does not bowl you over. Here the aromas are light and jammy, with strawberry. The body is medium in weight and intensity, with pure but basic cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. Like all other parts of the wine, the finish is easy and clean, with carry-over flavors of berry fruit.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"This pretty rosso has typical fragrances of dark fruit and spice. The palate shows ripe plum and cherry layered with cinnamon notes. It's fresh and ready to enjoy now, and would pair well with pasta dishes or grilled chicken.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"A wine called Earthquake is never going to be shy and retiring, especially from Lodi-grown fruit, so consider this truth in advertising. Big and unquestionably bold, this is a smoky, oaky, huge hit-you-in-the-face-with-fruit wine, full of blackberry and tobacco flavor.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Subdued aromas of espresso, tobacco, cedar, tilled soil and mature black fruit waft out of the glass. Made entirely with Cabernet Sauvignon, the elegant palate offers raw red currants, dried black cherries, clove and anise alongside silky but rather fleeting tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Slightly mulchy at first, with coffee grinds, leafy notes and mildly soupy red-fruit aromas. Airing helps it out, and it evolves into a sweet, herbal wine with baked berry fruit flavors and olive accents. Standard Chilean Cabernet that's a touch syrupy and herbal.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of blue flower, dark-skinned fruit, brown spice and grilled bell pepper come together in the glass. The palate offers dried black cherry, prune, espresso, coconut and a toasted note alongside tightly knit tannins. It's starting to dry up so drink soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Soft Pinot Noir gives this warm, rounded wine. Red-berry fruits are freshly cut with acidity while keeping the fruitiness to the fore. This bright, juicy wine is ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley-Rosé
"An early-release, single-vineyard wine that clocks in at a mere 12.5% abv in a warm vintage? Yes! This is quite aromatic with dark coffee, poblano pepper and herbs followed by a light, elegant styling that brings delicacy and nuance. Much like the variety, the wine is not for all comers.",US-Washington-Carmenère
"This smells sort of gaseous and mealy. It's soft and fleshy on the palate, with green banana and melony flavors. The finish is mild, green-leaning and bitter, with a flabby structure.",Chile-Maule Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Soft and already easy to drink, this exhibits California ripeness, and it offers cherry pie, chocolate and red licorice flavors.",US-California-Syrah
"Rugged and harsh in the mouth, with very modest berry flavors, and a touch of green, stemmy mint. Not much richness, but it's dry. Half the profits go to charity.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This is so chocolaty and rich, it's impossible to resist a second or third glass. Although it's heady in alcohol, there's an excellent burst of acidity, and the texture is pure velvet. The blackberry tart, orange zest, spice and sandalwood flavors change continuously as the wine warms in the glass.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"The Gaiole in Chianti area of Chianti Classico tends to produce some of the most traditional and pure expressions of Sangiovese, so Tangano is aged for 18 months in oak to add a spice note and to soften the tannins. The wine opens with prune, dark fruit, leather and tobacco tones.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Sourced from the Volamus Vineyard and aged in half new French oak, this has a leathery component. Tannic and big-boned, it's more savory than fruity, with a streak of mint lurking in the background.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Tight and textured, this is a mineral structured wine. Green fruits and acidity keep the wine fresh. The aftertaste is flatter, not bringing out enough fruit.",Portugal-Alentejo-Portuguese White
"While this is certainly a young fruity wine, it also has a soft texture to go with the juicy black fruits to make it ready to drink now. It is smoky, lightly tannic and packed full of ripe fruits.",France-Loire Valley-Cabernet Franc
"A multi-varietal blend, based on Viognier and Riesling. It's dryish to off-dry, and acidic, with savory flavors of oranges, limes and honeysuckle.",US-California-White Blend
"Production is down, quality, cost and finished alcohol are all up for this estate-grown designate, now labeled as a reserve. There's a sniff of leather and underripe blackberry and black cherry fruit, along with a somewhat unusual, though not unpleasant, scent of chicken boullion. The wine opens up quickly but stops just a bit short of a full-length finish. Give it extra breathing time if you plan to drink it soon.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"The continuing improvement at classed growth Camensac under the ownership of the Merlaut family (Chasse-Spleen, Citran, etc) is apparent even in the lesser vintage of 2007. The structure hangs well with the stalky but solid black berry fruit, the acidity a pure streak through it. Age over 4–5 years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This is an attractive pale-pink wine, faintly coppery in hue. It's also a bit confected, with candied strawberry and watermelon flavors reminiscent of bubble gum, but backed by white chocolate and briny notes. It's plump on the palate, then falls off rapidly on the finish.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"Dry and brittle, with some sharp tannic edges. Yet it's good and ripe in blackberries, cherries, currants and cedar. Decent price for a Napa Cab.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"An indifferent wine, hot and baked, with jammy sweet berry flavors.",US-California-Meritage
"A standout wine, this 100% varietal shows notes of raspberries, plum, bittersweet chocolate and barrel spices. It's classically styled with layer upon layer of fruit flavors, showing richness yet deftness with a real sense of freshness and vibrancy. It has all of the stuffing to lay down in the cellar until 2030 or more. Drinks best at 62 degrees.",US-Washington-Merlot

"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, with 10% Syrah added in, this is an appealing and forward wine, with a strong streak of barrel spice. Powdered sugar, cooked cherry, cassis and dark chocolate are the highlights. It showcases the lush, forward, spicy, barrel-influenced style of all the DiStefano reds.",US-Washington-Red Blend

The mouthfeel is very supple and the dark berry and black-cherry flavors are ripe and delicious.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A little too heavy in winemaker intervention. Shows the hand of oak, the funk of lees and a soft, buttery texture. This all dominates the citrus fruit and makes the wine ponderous.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Sweeter smelling than the usual Chard, with peach preserves, lychee, pear and pink florals unfolding in the bouquet. The mouth offers more oak-driven balance, with notes of cedar plank and spiced pears filling the cream-textured mouth. Seals the deal with a lingering, toasty finish.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Here is a Primitivo di Manduria that opens with soft aromas of black cherry, plum, prune and tobacco. The wine is integrated and balanced, with lingering tones of sweet spice on the finish. The palate feels velvety smooth.",Italy-Southern Italy-Primitivo

Deep berry flavors and lava rock minerality lead the palate, with peppercorn and roasted herb notes adding depth, and a tannic backbone providing structure.",US-California-Primitivo

"Heady but juicy Grenache dominates the blend of this wine, which also includes 30% Cinsault, 15% Syrah and 15% Mourvèdre.

Licorice and sweet spice stay well into the close.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rhône-style Red Blend

"Rich, creamy wood-aged wine that shows pear, apple and toast flavors ane even a hint of honey. Smooth and textured, it has fine final spice and acidity to add further interest.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Don’t look for Napa-esque depth or richness in South Coast Cabs. The frame is leaner, the flavors more austere. This wine seems thin and sharp, but there’s something about it—a sense of terroir, personality, call it what you will—that’s likable, even complex. It’s a bit aggressive right now, but should soften nicely with 2 or 3 years in the cellar.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"White flower and yellow stone fruit aromas lead the way in this straightforward white while the bright palate offers yellow apple, apricot and bitter almond flavors. Zesty acidity gives it a refreshing finish.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"Kind of clunky now. Bigtime tannins make it astringent, and the fruit flavors, of blackberries and sour cherry candy coated with oak, feel ripely heavy on the palate. Yet it's a clean wine, and could surprise down the road. Try after 2012.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"An assortment of vineyards contributes to this tight and chewy Cabernet, blended with small percentages of Merlot and Cab Franc. The crunchy black fruits and underlying minerality contribute to the impression of well-structured compactness, with plenty of potential for aging through 2022–2024.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a ripe, fruity wine with rich strawberry flavor. Light tannins and just the right amount of acidity make it fresh, juicy and already attractive.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This is a spicy, ripe wine that has fine acidity as well as layers of tannins and a dense texture. It is developing fast, bringing out delicious freshness and red fruits. The vineyards are being converted to organic—a multi-year process. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Estate grown and seeming to hint at some time in oak, this dry and lightly spicy wine features apple and pear fruit, already smooth and rounded and ready to drink. More in the style of Oregon Pinot Gris than Italian Pinot Grigio.",US-Washington-Pinot Grigio
"The vineyard has had a long, checkered history, and Byron has dipped into it for many years for Pinot Noir that's almost always compelling. Their ‘06 is a dark, full-bodied wine. It's dense in young, jammy black cherry and mocha fruit and very spicy. Feels dramatically rich and complex, and should develop bottle nuance over the next six years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Blended with 10% Syrah, this is a voluptuous, rich wine, dry and full-bodied. It has blackberry, blueberry, chocolate, bacon and sweet oak flavors. Clearly the winery's best, albeit most expensive Cabernet ever, it's gorgeous to drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Lava Cap has made a decent version of Barbera here, simple and blueberry-toned but the wine is a tad heavy and overly oaked and bitter on the finish.",US-California-Barbera
"Aromatic and elegant, generous and supple, this tastes rich while feeling polished and complete. An enticing, light aroma of oaky spice and raspberry mixes with tasty red cherry and black currant flavors on the palate. It is medium bodied, smooth in texture, and has a mild finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Truly a wine that overdelivers, this packs molten fudge cake, vanilla-laced black-currant syrup and chocolate pudding with a fresh sprig of mint on the nose.

"Velvety smooth, and brimming with ripe berry flavors, this wine feels broad and rich on the palate, carrying flavors like black plums and boysenberry jam. So ripe it's almost sweet, the wine is nothing if not generous and fruity. A 7% addition of Port-style sweet wine gives it that extra dimension.",US-California-Zinfandel
"The 2004 vintage is certainly mature, but with a light touch it is still attractive to drink. Mushroom and spice are lifted by juicy acidity. The dryness at the end shows it is ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This wine pushes the envelope on concentration and ripeness. It's full of prune, raisin and licorice on the nose, but also a lot of weight.

"This clonal study could have used a touch of help from other clones, but it's still a very tasty and vibrant wine.

"A rich, opulent wine at an unbelievable price, this Chard has layers of ripe peaches, pears and tropical fruits, and a lush overlay of toasty oak. The wonderfully creamy texture leads to a long, spicy finish. Despite the statewide appellation, this is as good as many regional Chardonnays.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Full, round aromas of berry fruits are oaky and appealing. In the mouth, this wine is ultradry, tannic and raw. Flavors of blackberry, plum and coffee finish hard and abrasive due to scraping tannins.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This blend of 75% Garnacha, 20% Tempranillo and 5% Viura opens with oaky aromas of cigar box, floral notes and raisin. A snappy, fresh palate reflects high elevation and a north-facing vineyard exposure, while this tastes oaky and of herbal currant and raspberry. A spicy finish of dried red-fruit notes and a saucy snap fits into the traditional mode for Rioja. Drink through 2021.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"Meaty, dark and concentrated, with a smoky bouquet that shows spice and berry aromas. The palate is soft, lush and deep, with heavy flavors of blackberry, tea, spice and pepper. Finishes easy and chocolaty, with good length and drive. Drink now through 2012.",Chile-Maule Valley-Red Blend
"This Fiddletown Zin has a sweet graham cracker and marshmallow quality about it, soft and round in the middle, and a finish that's long and a touch green.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Crisp, green, grassy wine with fresh acidity and herbeceous character. It is very New World with its tropical flavors and open, forward fruit.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon Blanc
"The wine opens with an inky dark color and segues to thick aromas of black fruit, espresso, tobacco and spice. Most of the action is on the nose however, because the mild mouthful offers just enough structure and acidity to compliment those foods.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Shows varietally correct grassiness and herbal notes on the nose, followed by round, honeyed fruit flavors that turn racy and grapefruity on the finish. Suitable as an apéritif or paired with slightly weighty fish dishes.",Australia-South Australia-Sauvignon Blanc

"Dusty mineral and herbal aromas contrast against a palate that's chock full of raspberry and cherry flavor. It's forward with fruit, but a bit strikingly acidic, spiked by a razor-like edge of cranberry and lemon.",US-New York-Rosé
"Notable for its soft texture, thoroughly ripe fruit, and richness of mouthfeel, which is what you want in Pinot Noir. It's not an ager, but so deliciously refined, you want to keep drinking. Shows ripe raspberries and cherries, with their liqueur counterparts, and the sweet smokiness of oak.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Powerfully oaked but awkward, with bruising aromas of fresh-cut wood, sawdust and campfire smoke. Amid the woodiness and thick body you'll find roasted plum and berry flavors, but on the finish resin reappears and lingers. Tastes too saucy and resiny to be called “clean.”",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"This producer is honing in on the unconventional, sourcing Pinot Noir grapes from unlikely Napa Valley spots like Spring Mountain and Atlas Peak. The resulting wines are surprising and unpredictable in their complexity of savory blithe spirit, light and clear with edgy red cherry and tea, plenty structured, with lurking tannin. The floral aspect on the nose is compelling, as is the cardamon finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Animal hide and roasted, stalky aromas bring overall quality into question. This feels raw, choppy and drawing, while flavors of stalky berry fruits are leathery and roasted. Hard tannins and green notes influence the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Still young and showing fresh fruitiness, this wine needs time to calm down and broaden out. Made of four classic varieties in the Esporão vineyard, it's dense, stalky and still full of tannins. Give this wine until 2016.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"This winery is striving to show that Burgundian varietals can work in the cooler Willow Creek region of Paso Robles, where sea breeze comes through the Templeton Gap. This bottling provides good evidence, with aromas of crushed rocks, vanilla toast, roasted apple and peach. Brisk apple cider dominates the palate, picking up roasted almonds in the midpalate and possessing quite a bit of pear skin grip.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This engages the taste buds with bright, ripe fruit flavors and balances them with good crisp acidity and light tannins, plus spicy oak accents that resemble vanilla, allspice and nutmeg. Medium to full bodied, it feels smooth in the mouth but the lip-smacking tannins carry through on the finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Still very tight, this Cab needs some time to develop in bottle, its dark fruit and coffee-laced tannins just barely able to come alive and show off their provenance. This is an oft-sourced vineyard in the Livermore Valley, one to look for when it comes to both Chardonnay and Cabernet, as well as other Bordeaux varieties. This wine is 100% Del Arroyo Cab.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dark and rich in color, this dense, gamy and smoky wine offers licorice and leather in equal proportions. It's still young and grippy on the palate, but time should soften its layers, which do mellow on the finish. Cellar through 2017,",US-California-Syrah
"This is an eye-opening wine that shows how good Cabernet from the Sierra Foothills can be. Beautiful deep black cherry and cassis aromas lead to broad generous flavors that instantly expand across the palate and accompany a moderately tannic, elegant texture. Hints of black fig, cedar and mint surround the concentrated fruit core, adding to the wine's complexity.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"An old-vine wine that was aged in clay amphoras, this is a ripe, honeyed, gently oxidized wine. This aging gives a lift to the pineapple and green plum fruit flavors that are shot through with acidity. It's a rich wine both from the oxidation and from the really ripe fruits. Age this complex wine until 2019.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"Dry, leathery and earthy up front, this mature Mencía is all about grip and complexity. In the mouth, it's tight and tannic.

"If you want to understand the essence of Dry Creek Valley Zinfandal, taste this wine. It's absolutely classic. Shows the region's balance, power and elegance.

The high alcohol feels absolutely natural.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Konrad's 2008 Pinot Noir shows quite a bit of toast and vanilla to go alongside its cherry fruit. Gently toasted marshmallows impart a sweet succulence to the wine, making it attractive despite some woody tannins on the finish. Drink now–2014.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"This wine is a field blend of eight different clones of this variety. It opens with reserved, slightly reduced aromas of sea shell, mineral and citrus that lead to lighter-styled fruit and mineral flavors.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"A soft, simple, fruity Merlot. Tastes like a cherry, blackberry, roasted almond, cocoa and cinnamon granola bar, melted into wine.",US-California-Merlot
"Tons of raspberry, vanilla and licorice, backed by spice, coffee and all sorts of size and depth. The complexity is excellent, but so is the straightforward attitude it shows. Given time, it unfolds in layer upon layer of excitement. A gem of an appellation wine; it makes you wonder just how good the Ponzi Reserve will be.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"On the surface there is brisk, spicy grapefruit zest, while underneath the nose hints at generously ripe apricot and Mirabelle plum. The palate plays off juicy stone fruit and zesty citrus on a sleek, slender, concentrated body. The freshness is brisk and taut, while the fruit is charming and soft. With a slender, sleek and dry mouthfeel, this is just what you want from Riesling.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"The color of this wine with 11.6% residual sugar is dark gold and the aromas all raisin and dried apricot. Thick and rich, it has a wealth of vanilla and caramel toffee to offer, with a need for cheese.",US-California-Riesling

"This thick, and darkly concentrated Barolo offers a wide range of aromas and evident complexity. It boasts a very polished, smooth feel in the mouth that is reinforced by the natural firmness of the noble Nebbiolo grape.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"The aromas that come together are those of scorched earth, grilled porcini, roasted coffee bean and a bit of burnt rubber. The mature palate offers dried cherry, blackberry confiture, mocha, vanilla and a hint of game alongside tongue-drying tannins that clench the finish. Give this a few years to unfold then drink sooner rather than later.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This full-bodied but informal wine has sensations of leafy forest floor, mature black cherry, prune and tobacco alongside firm tannins. It's straightforward with a warm midpalate and shy on fresh acidity so enjoy it soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese

There is fabulous energy and texture on the sip, where chalky flavors meet with red apple and a hint of rosewater.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A five-grape Bordeaux-style blend, this has a scent of rose water that drifts above earthier notes and tart berry flavors. Tight and focused, it finishes with a lick of cola and espresso.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Perfectly fills the need in California for a bone-dry, racy white wine. Acidity is the star here, enriched with savory lemon and lime zest, grilled pineapple, pepper and mineral flavors. After all the oak and supersweetness of too many wines, it makes you want to sing and dance.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"Smooth and modern in character, with toast and sweet-tasting fruit notes, this is a wine that characterizes the New World school of Bordeaux winemaking. It has extracted tannins and concentration, with a dark chocolate flavor. Aging will soften the extremes, so give it 3–4 years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Officially a Vino Spumante Aromatico di Qualita, this gentle bubbly features pretty orange-blossom highlights, a soft, rich and seductive mouthfeel, and good concentration through a pleasingly long finish. Very nicely made and thoroughly enjoyable. The midnight blue bottle is easy to spot on the retail shelf.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"Attractive, strong oak accents like charcoal and bacon dress up this full-bodied, high-octane wine. The palate is bold and ripe, with dark fruit flavors. The American oak bottling exhibits greater tannic structure than the French oak bottling, and it's interesting to enjoy them side by side.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Feral, rustic aromas of sweaty leather, tar, animal hide and dried cheese override core berry fruit scents. This is a tannic, grippy monster with a mix of licorice, medicinal and black-fruit flavors. The finish is staunch and tannic, with creamy oak notes and a borderline syrupy feel. Drink from 2016 through 2025.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"A nice everyday Chard, fairly rich in fruit, herb and spice flavors, and with a nice overlay of oak. Easy to drink and totally dry.",US-California-Chardonnay

Coarse, fine-grained tannins and brisk acidity lend structure and gravitas.",US-New York-Merlot
"This ambitious wine is bold in every aspect, from the deep, deep color, to the dark chocolate and cherry aromas to the rich, almost thick blackberry flavors and very firm texture. It has the variety's typical assertive tartness plus a good layer of tannin, but matches those with ripe flavors.",US-California-Barbera
"Aromas of coconut, spicy plum cake, mocha and vanilla waft out of the glass. The warm palate doles out stewed plum, blackberry, espresso, licorice and a confectionary note alongside bracing, astringent tannins that dry the mouth. The intense oak sensations throw this off balance.",Italy-Southern Italy-Primitivo
"Like many of Denis Pommier's wines, this comes from old vines, and the concentration is testament to that. The texture is rich, touched by honeyed wood, with peaches in syrup ripeness. As a contrast, there is also a fresh, red apple acidity, which gives a lift to the aftertaste.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This ripe, lively wine is bursting with red fruits. Crisp and clean, it features a light mineral character that gives it tight texture balanced by refreshing raspberry and orange flavors. The aftertaste shines with crisp acidity.",France-Provence-Rosé

A wine that contrasts extreme sweetness with freshness. It has beautiful acidity as well as a great swathe of sweet peach and orange laced with honeyed cream.,France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"This wine does a great imitation of a Port at a lighter alcohol level. The color is deep and inky, the aromas are concentrated and uberripe, and the texture is thick, nicely tannic yet smooth. Bring on the chocolate or cigars.",US-California-Red Blend
"This is textbook Marlborough Pinot Noir, featuring aromas that hint at mushroom, beetroot and ripe cherries. The palate is on the light side, with silky tannins and crisp acids that bend the fruit toward pie cherry and cranberry on the tart finish. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"Beautiful richness and intensity make for a very welcoming bouquet. This 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend lasts long on the palate, and boasts luscious aromas of blackberry, Maraschino cherry, tobacco and lightly toasted hazelnut. Extrasoft, velvety tannins characterize the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Dark berry, scorched earth, menthol and baking spice aromas come together on this along with a balsamic note. The tense palate delivers steeped plum, dried black cherry, mint, sage clove and licorice set against youthfully assertive tannins. Drink 2019–2028.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"A light garnet color and layers of classic aromas like tea, rhubarb, cherry and a nice walk-in-the-pines element segue to gentle cherry, raspberry and black tea in this medium-bodied, elegant wine. It's also classic in the sense that complexity and drinkability rule over sheer power.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This 100% varietal wine is a blend of fruit from The Benches, Dionysus and Pepper Bridge vineyards. Aromas of cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, blackberry and French-oak spice rise up from the glass. The palate brings rich, velvety dark fruit flavors backed by fine-grained tannins. It needs some time to fully settle in. Best after 2021.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Blended with 25% Grenache, this is an enjoyable wine with notes of peppery spice and plum. It's all about mouthfeel, light fruit flavors and citrusy acidity.",US-Oregon-Syrah

"This new cuvée is sourced from a 2008 planting of the Swan clone, rare in Oregon. The aromatics are dazzling, with a lightly peppery, meaty aspect around slightly muted notes of herb and rock. The fruit is especially generous, with blackberry and boysenberry predominant. The wine is stylish, with cut and precision. Though truly exceptional, it needs your complete attention and some extra aeration to show its best.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Ripe mango, peach and pineapple all come together in this rich, opulent wine. Round yet there's a strong ginger and spice component. This is a complex wine, textured, rich and worth aging for at least another two years. Glass stopper.",Austria-Südsteiermark-Sauvignon Blanc
"This sparkler was made from a majority of Chardonnay with a seasoning of Pinot Noir, the grapes grown at Hyde Vineyard, among other sites within the appellation. A doughy, tart wine, it brightly expresses green apple, orange, grapefruit and a more developed creaminess of biscotti, delighting in a persistence of lemon zest.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"There is great texture in this wine. It is structured, tannic with a strong pepper bite balanced by acidity. Citrus fruit shows through with fresh acidity and a tangy aftertaste.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This wine opens with aromas of earthy funk, steak tartare, potpourri, pepper and earth, showing outrageously minerality. The flavors are dense and textured, leaning hard into the savory with abundant flower and fire pit notes that linger effortlessly. It's a very cerebral wine but with no shortage of hedonism.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Aromas of French oak, toast, menthol, exotic spice and black-skinned fruit unfold on this. The ripe, savory palate offers fleshy black cherry, vanilla, licorice and coffee framed in firm but velvety tannins that lend structure. Drink 2017–2022.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A spicy note of cinnamon or bitter almond opens the nose of this tangy Soave. In the mouth, it delivers layers of stone fruit, honey, pineapple and pear. Pair this vineyard-designate white with roasted eggplant in curry sauce. The high alcohol does stand out.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"Not a success. The wine is thick, heavy and lifeless, with syrupy cherry and cassis flavors that have way too little acidity to perk them up.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Bright, light oak shadings dress up this medium-bodied wine, complementing the red cherry and strawberry flavors. It's fresh, fruity and not very tannic—easy to drink and enjoy.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aggressive tannins and an unusually strong herbal component make this new vintage of Feather a bit difficult to assess at this moment. It's peppery and stemmy in the nose, earthy and tannic in the mouth, with suggestions of asparagus. Quite a change from past vintages, but perhaps just a stage in its further evolution.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Though quite pale in color due to no barrel aging, there is a nicely rounded candy nose of bright green apple and vanilla, alongside some sharper spice. On the palate, more green apple dominates, along with lemon-lime, slight guava and an acidity that causes the wine to dance across the tongue.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This mixes blueberry, boysenberry and blackberry notes with a dressing of Bourbon and chocolate. Smooth and satiny, this is drinking exceptionally well at the moment.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This has a pale salmon color and aromas like those of Pinot Noir, including the walk-in-the-forest smell. Crisp cherry flavors lead to an intriguing mushroom note on the finish. Nearly dry, the texture is plush and soothing, while the finish is soft and lingering.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"An incredibly pure and piercing note of lemon oil hits the nose. The medium-sweet palate impresses with both fresh and dried notes of fruit: plum, white sultana, white currant and the ripest pear and apple you can imagine. This is full-on and big but balanced by tingling, fresh and precise acidity. A field blend of polar opposites, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, this unites their virtues of aromatic textured richness and poised finesse. Again, this is not a wine that is easily categorized with its medium-sweet, soil- and fruit-driven profile, but it is a joy to experience and savor. The finish lasts and lasts. Drink 2017–2035.",France-Alsace-Alsace white blend
"This wine is filled with robust Zinny flavors, ranging from wild raspberries and red currants to tobacco, mocha and crushed black pepper.

Drink now–2016.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A blend of 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Syrah, 2% Malbec and 2% Merlot, this wine offers velvety blackberry jam and chocolate in undulating waves. Dusty, soft tannins complete the likable package, while the finish is akin to enjoying baked plums in a cigar bar.",US-California-Red Blend

"This is a good followup to Merryvale's 2009. While it was barrel fermented in nearly half new French oak, it never feels overly manipulated or fussy. Marked by crisp acidity and Carneros minerality, it's an elegant, clean wine, with subtle Meyer lemon, lime and Asian pear flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"After 22 months in half new French oak, this blend of fruit from four widely separate vineyards inevitably kills the specificity. What's left is a quickly maturing wine with blueberry pie, clove and baking spices. Drink up.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"The wine opens with awkward tones that recall Band-Aid and farmyard—these completely blow off after a few minutes in the glass. Beyond them are ripe aromas of black berry fruit, cassis and molasses. It tastes a bit sour but comes through with solid red fruit in the end.",Italy-Southern Italy-Red Blend
"There is no mistaking the firm tannins of Saint-Estèphe in this wine. At the same time, these tannins are balanced with the generous ripe flavor of black fruit and almost-sweet acidity. The property was  created by Joseph Laffitte in 1759, right in the center of the Saint-Estèphe plateau.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Pear, citrus and hazelnut aromas lead the nose on this sparkling wine made with no added dosage. The palate reveals juicy yellow apple, lime and roasted nut alongside soft acidity and a refined, persistent mousse. It finishes tangy and dry.",Italy-Lombardy-Sparkling Blend
"If you “talk dry and taste sweet,” as they say, you'll like this wine. It's not really dry at all. But it's very rich in tropical fruit, wildflower, honey and spice flavors that are balanced out by good enough acidity.",US-California-Viognier
"Sweet and jammy, with pie-filling flavors of blackberries and black cherries, spiced up with cocoa, anise, cinnamon and brown sugar. This soft, tasty Cab is probably at its best now and soon.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This blend of 35% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Petite Sirah is actually a party of three, but the results are solid. Chocolate, black cherries, scarlet rose buds and toasted oak pop on the nose. The smooth and dense palate shows boysenberry, black pepper and a chalky tannic structure.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is tight, mineral and on the dry side of Brut. The 100% Chardonnay taste signals chalky soil—crisp and fresh. A pure line of acidity cuts through the texture, giving a balanced, always dry wine that could do with more bottle aging to soften the piercing acidity at the end.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"This rich, spicy Zinfandel defines the Dry Creek style. It's fruit-forward in briary, brambly berry and currant flavors that have hints of anise and chocolate, and is dry, with sturdy tannins and a balancing cut of acidity. Very enticing. Only 150 cases were produced, but it's worth a search.",US-California-Zinfandel

"This is a full-bodied wine, with the Pinot fruit showing strongly in the blend, producing richness and a sweet-tasting character.

Red-jelly fruit flavors suggest the fruit for this wine was superripe. That gives an unbalanced character between the tannins and the fruit. Acidity at the end is a more hopeful sign.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This tastes a bit over-cropped; the varietal character is there, but it's a pale rendition. Lightly peppery and grassy, with hints of citrus and very green apple fruit. Straightforward and simple.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"The Gunderloch wines are among the best from Rheinhessen, even their non-site-specific wines like the Diva spätlese.

"This 100% varietal wine opens with a strong bouquet of black licorice, maybe even fennel, before big, boisterous tannins stomp the stage. Full bodied and exuberant in blackberry and black cherry, the oak is measured. A backbone of structure could stand up to aging.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Modest lemony aromas set up additional scents of balsam wood, dried cherry, plum and spice. The palate is forward, maybe a touch sharp in terms of acidity, with rustic, roasted, leathery flavors. It is a big wine that finishes lively and also a little rooty and roasted. Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec-Merlot is the blend.",Argentina-Other-Red Blend
"Try sneaking this into your next wine group blind tasting. It might turn some heads. It shows the ripe, polished cherry, plum, sage, carob and licorice flavors of the finest Merlots, with rich, finely ground tannins, and finishes dry. With a drop of Cabs Sauvignon and Franc, it has true complexity.",US-California-Merlot
"96-98 Barrel sample. A powerful wine, packed with tannins from structured Cabernet fruits. It exudes muscularity, intensity and concentration. The wood element is present. Maybe the final freshness is missing.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Made from single (777) clone, organically-grown grapes, the Blackjack Block Pinot Noir is focused and complex. The mid-palate shows flesh and fat, ripe berry and cherry fruit, with a backing of citrusy acids. Its middle is its strength; it would benefit from blending to add more depth to both front and back.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Made with dried Verduzzo and Riesling grapes, this sweet wine offers aromas of ripe apricot, baked apple and pressed flower. The palate delivers dried orchard fruit, orange zest and vanilla. It ends on a note of acacia honey.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend

"This is a straightforward, plump, fruity Chardonnay. Round peach and lemon flavors get a burst of energy from hints of pineapple and citrus, finishing clean and fresh. Drink now.",Australia-Western Australia-Chardonnay
"On the toasty, oaky side of New Zealand's Syrah spectrum, with plenty of cedary notes layered over plum and cherry fruit. Despite the oak treatment, it still retains a sense of freshness, and the fruit really comes through on the finish. Try in 2013.",New Zealand-Hawke's Bay-Syrah
"This wine opens with a confectionary nose, slowly unleashing its thick, concentrated richness of dark cherry and cassis on the palate. Between the layers are grippy tannins and shakes of meaty leather and black pepper. This could stand some time in a decanter or swirling in the glass before enjoying.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
Roast beef and black cherry notes open this juicy example from South Australia. Fresh but diffuse fruit notes dominate the crisp palate and lead to a cherry-flavored finish that lacks persistance. Drink now.,Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"The blend is 70% Pinot Blanc, with Riesling and Pinot Noir splitting the rest. The winery calls it a “red-style white” and it has some tawny color from five days fermenting on the skins. But it's simply odd, flat and lifeless, with dusty generic fruit.",US-Oregon-White Blend
"This is an elegant and stylish wine that's full of lively acidity, red berry fruitiness and soft tannins. The wine is well integrated, with just a touch of gaminess and bright acidity on the finish. It is ready to drink.",France-Provence-Rhône-style Red Blend

"A smoothly ripe wine, with swathes of cherry and black currant fruits balanced by lively acidity. The wine, with its richness and the tannic structure, could well age for 3-4 years, although its fruitiness makes it delicious now.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This shows the power and purity of the winery's coastal Pastorale and Quarter Moon vineyards, in this cool vintage that allowed for long hang time. Although some coastal Pinots were plagued by rot, this one was not, resulting in a wine with delicious raspberry and cherry notes, accented by new French oak. It's very fine, complex and enjoyable now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Saucy aromas of stewed plum and tomato ragu lack clarity. This is midlevel Cabernet, with a light bounce to its step. Generic cherry, cassis and licorice flavors finish with acidic kick but no sense of refinement.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Sanguine, dense and thick, this offers an intriguing nose of black pepper and garrigue that conveys a sense of adventure and romance. Its leathery texture never becomes overly weighty, though the fruit and oak are plenty generous. An ideal partner for an equally beautiful steak, its structure suggests time in the cellar will only add to the experience; drink through 2022.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This dense and dark wine is full of ripe, richly juicy black fruits. Solid tannins and layers of wood are softening into the rest of the wine. It's going to develop slowly, releasing the fruit into the tannic structure. Wait until 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"An attractive blend that includes 20% Cabernet Franc, this is a soft perfumed wine. It has spice and toast from the wood aging which will integrate better in the coming months. The black fruits and acidity are already well in place. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Firm and spicy, this blend of Sangiovese and 10% Merlot opens with aromas of black plum, crushed violet and kitchen spices. The juicy palate delivers ripe black cherry, licorice and clove alongside a backbone of tightly wound but refined tannins. Drink 2016–2020.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"Toasted oak and vanilla give this wine substance and style. It's fuller bodied and robust on the palate, still young and holding on to some weight. A touch of grapefruit spruces up the proceedings, providing crispness just in time.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"A combination of char, licorice, blackberry and cassis aromas is about as complete and pleasing as it gets for Malbec. This doesn't lose it in the mouth, where things are firm and true, with solid tannins. Charred flavors carry onto the flavor profile along with blackberry and hickory smoke, while the finish is toasty, chocolaty and spicy. Drink through 2021.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Mouthwatering acidity and berry freshness mark this muscular young Pinot Noir. It's gritty in tannins and brilliant in acids, with subtle flavors of sour red cherries, persimmons and cola, as well as a mushroomy earthiness to which oak adds exotic sandalwood notes. Very dry and fine, complex and provocative, a wine to let warm in the glass as it changes by the minute. Drink now–2015.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"An immediately attractive wine that carries its ripe fruit easily. Both the fruit and the structure are dense, with flavors of dried raisins balanced by fresh acidity. It is already maturing, so drink in 2 years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Lean and sheen, this light-footed dry Riesling is a showcase of minerality over fruit. It's demure in concentration but refreshing, finishing brisk and clean.",US-New York-Riesling
"Lightly oaked, this Chardonnay is sweet and forward in pineapple jam, buttered popcorn and caramelized flavors. It's balanced with crisp, Central Coast acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Silhouette is Merryvale's small-production best of barrels blend from the winery's various vineyards. The '08 is a success, showing brisk acidity and new oak and yeast flavors and a creamy texture framing ripe pineapple, pear and mineral flavors. It's an elegant wine that shouldn't be served too cold.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Lean and bright, this easygoing Vermentino would pair well with fried calamari or vegetable tempura. The palate shows fullness and a fragrant lemon-zest flavor.",Italy-Tuscany-Vermentino
"Clean but basic in its approach. The nose has dusty apricot and melon aromas, while the palate deals nectarine, citrus and peach flavors. That it's fresh, wet and easy on the tongue is probably the best thing it has going for it. Won't last a whole lot longer; drink now.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay

"This is the first vintage made in the brand-new winery that was finished just in time for crush in 2007. It captures the Pepper Bridge vineyard character perfectly—pretty strawberry fruit, dappled with fresh herbs and white pepper. The aromas are pretty and clean, and the wine does not over-reach.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Very high alcohol in this superripe wine shows in a hot, chili pepper feeling and in the impression of sweetness. Both combine to give the berry-cherry flavors a rustic quality.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Syrah dominates the blend on this dry, complex red wine. It brings tannins and deep flavors of blackberries and charred meat. One-third of Grenache adds lightness and cherries, while oak contributes the perfect note of toast. The alcohol is high, but it never feels hot, just mouth-filling and warming. It's a polished and complex wine that brings to mind a perfect steak.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"With a yellowish color and round melony aromas that are suggestive of candle wax, this feels oily and a touch viscous, but not fat or out of shape. Dry, slightly salty melon flavors finish strong.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"Burnt rubber and a certain stemmy, roasted character is draped over the nose and palate. It has a decent, normal feel to it but the flavors of strawberry and raspberry are herbal and burnt. Tastes and smells rubbery and not fully clean.",Spain-Central Spain-Tempranillo
"Mint and graphite aromas make for a cool nose on this 50/50 Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon. Rubbery tannins mixed with extracted berry flavors create more noise than poise on the palate. A spicy, herbal, chocolaty finish is punchy and borderline punishing.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Still shy but invitingly soft, it has a charming peachiness that cushions both the lemony acidity and the streak of stony minerality. Edges of mandarin peel and flesh add to the allure, which will increase with age. Softly-spoken but very convincing and long.",Austria-Kamptal-Riesling
"An intriguing nose of lemon, pineapple, vanilla and banana candies are encased in a waft of warm yeast. Flavors of honeydew, more pineapple and oak spice are folded into a saline and nutty component. The weight is plush and feels silky on the tongue.",US-Virginia-Chardonnay
"Bryan Babcock sources from the Buona Terra Vineyard for this bottling that shows intensely focused aromas of candied pomegranate, cola, anise seed and dew on sweet sagebrush. It's rich and soft on the palate, yet lively with intense herbal energy and grippy tension, all laid across the juice of ripe red berries.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Sparkling richness stars in this concentrated, ultimately balanced wine, which offers a warming note of pear compote and peach within subtle waves of toasted oak. The lushly cradled fruit is awash in anise and fennel.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Here's a gorgeous wine to pair with foie gras or pâté. A Riserva expression of Gewürztraminer, it opens with a bright golden color and segues to intense aromas of honey, candied peach, yellow rose, lemon curd and natural rubber. In the mouth, the wine is rich, opulent and long-lasting.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Gewürztraminer

"Delicate aromas of lemon blossom, ripe Asian pear and a touch of yellow melon show on the nose of this versatile and tasty bottling. Grippy tension consumes the palate, led by lemon rind, but there's also a richer yellow-apple and pear core as well as a bit of pineapple.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Dusty blueberry and chocolate provide heftiness to this full-bodied, densely concentrated wine, which ends simply and without much fanfare.",US-California-Petite Sirah

"Earthy, fairly deep aromas of black fruits and mellow spices come with plenty of oak. In the mouth, this is fresh in feel and medium in body.

"In this pale colored rosé, the palate is as light as the color. It is crisp and fresh while the dosage gives a soft, ripe strawberry flavor. The wine is in balance, with a touch of tannin from the Pinot Noir used to make the rosé. The bottle needs no aging.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This is a nice, plush Cabernet, soft and sweet in blackberry, currant and chocolate fruit flavors, but it's not a classic example of Mount Veeder Cabs, which are usually drier and more tannic. Drink in the short term.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Brilliantly aromatic, this wine beguiles with exotic scents of plum pudding, spice cake, cherry compote, pipe tobacco, red licorice and raspberry jam. All that and more can be tasted—the wine is a riot of fruits and baking spices. This makes the best possible case for Mourvèdre as a stand-alone varietal wine here in Washington.",US-Washington-Mourvèdre
"Earthy plum and raspberry aromas are probing and raw. This feels acidic to the point of cutting. Sour, salty, herbal red-fruit flavors are gritty and rough on the finish. This is Salta Cabernet in its most raw, least appealing form.",Argentina-Other-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Production has increased dramatically, but quality remains quite good for this estate-grown Cabernet Franc. Deep and plummy, it's a rich, round mouthful of blue and black fruits that are dressed up with plenty of spicy oak tones. The tannins are polished and bring some finishing flavors of black tea. This should age for a decade at least.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"Hints of damp earth and new leather lend a distinctive taste profile to this full-bodied, ripe and broad-textured wine. Boosted by baking spices, toasted baguette and dried plum notes, the wine gets more complex with time in the glass.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This is an imposing, enormous style of wine that smells minty, tastes dense and ripe, and feels massive due to full body and layers of fine tannins. It will be fun to drink with grilled lamb chops or something equally rich, where all the tannin and flavor will meet their match.",US-California-Meritage

"One of the winery's single-clone bottlings, this brings tart strawberry and cranberry fruit into focus. It's a young bright stylish effort, with a touch of chocolate and fine tannins.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Grapy aromas of berry fruits and the dust of spearmint gum set up a loud, high-acid, seemingly electrified palate that tastes of black currant, blackberry and plum.

"This sparkling relative of a popular Italian table wine has a floral nose with a perfume quality. “Sweet” is the operative word here, with an almost candied edge to the fruit. It’s a quaff for the sweet-tooth crowd, or better yet, for making mimosas.",Italy-Veneto-White Blend
"Ripe peach and floral aromas waft from this sprightly off-dry Riesling. A hint of pressed apple lends a savory feel to the mid palate, but it finishes briskly with a squirt of lemon and lime.",US-New York-Riesling

"Of the four De Coelo Pinot Noirs sourced from this one special site, Arbore Sacra is the most earthy, savory and viscous. Grapes come from the Calera clone, beautifully structured and shyly subtle. In this graceful wine, expect nuanced layers of Asian spice and blackberry, with finely honed tannins and a lingering, spicy finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is an estate-grown, stainless-steel fermented, perfectly varietal expression of Sauvignon Blanc. It's not trying to be Chardonnay, happily; rather it shows the pleasantly grassy side of the grape, with light melon and green apple fruit flavors.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"Made of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this has subdued black-skinned fruit and underbrush aromas. Assertive tannins frame a palate of prune, tobacco and black pepper flavors. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"Bone dry and tart in acidity, this has tobacco, sour cherry and crushed black-pepper flavors. While it doesn't show much richness, it's silky and elegant on the palate, with a certain earthy complexity.

"A strong effort from Vavasour's second label, the 2008 Dashwood SB features vibrant aromas of crushed tomato leaf and hints of jalapeño and flavors of green tomato and gooseberry.

"This is bright and fruity, with light, fragrant and poised red fruit. It has attractive acidity to balance.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This comes from the northern end of the line-up of Premier Crus, which shows in the lively, crisp and tightly fruity character of the wine. It is developing slowly, still controlled and with light hints of toast. It will be a beautiful, bright wine. Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"Ripe malty berry aromas blend seamlessly with darker notes of toasty oak and asphalt. This Cab Franc (with 15% Malbec) feels big and pulpy, but also healthy and juicy. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and mixed herbs finish with oaky notes of mocha, coffee and toasty berry. Drink through 2024.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Franc

"Light banana flambée, vanilla meringue and yellow-cake aromas show on the generous but not overbearing nose of this blend of 49% Grenache Blanc, 31% Viognier, 12% Roussanne and 8% Marsanne. The tropicality of the nose disappears on the palate, which is tart and grippy with green apple and Anjou pear flavors as well as a touch of melon and smoke.",US-California-Rhône-style White Blend
"Not quite ripe, with a vegetal, herbal edge to the cherry and raspberry fruit. The acidity is nice and brisk, and the texture is beautifully silky, but that tug of greenness distracts, and limits ageability.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This blend of 50% Syrah and 50% Cabernet Franc is a bit over the hill, so drink up now. Prune, raisin, leather, roasted meat and pepper show on the nose, while the palate offers dried cherries and dust.",US-California-Red Blend

"This is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon blended with 16% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc.

The mid-palate still needs some time to fully come together but when it does, it will be a beauty.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Coteaux Varois is a small area in the heart of the Provence vineyards. This wine is fresh, fruity and light in texture. With its strawberry fruits, it has a crisp side and attractive acidity. The wine, with its fresh aftertaste, is ready to drink.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Made from a mix of vineyards across the Napa Valley, this pays tribute to the early days of grape growing in the region and is a wine equally worthy of recognition. Exhibiting dark cherry stone and wild strawberry aromas, the palate is complex, tannic and round, a subtle suggestion of smoke on the finish balanced by bright acidity.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Solidly in the Hillside Select model, this vigorous young Cab is dramatically ripe and powerful. The flavors of red and black currants, milk chocolate, figs and smoky vanilla erupt in the mouth, making the tastebuds jump with joy. However, there is also the structure, among the greatest in California Cabs. The acidity is fine, but the tannins are stupendously rich, sweet and complex, practically a food group in themselves. Stunning and gorgeous now in its youth, this collectible wine will reward at least through 2015.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe blackberry, leather and soy show on the nose of this solid bottling from a relatively new producer in the heart of the Santa Ynez Valley. Fruit-forward flavors of red and purple berries rise to the top of the palate, but there is also a tannic density powered by pencil lead and a spicy acidity.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"This blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache has some pretty raspberry, pomegranate and Bing cherry fruit flavors. Dried herbs add a nice grace note, but the finish brings a darker, roasted character that turns slightly burnt and bitter.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend

"The wine is firm with acidity and spice in tandem. It has a juicy character, although the acidity seems unbalanced with the rest of the wine.",Portugal-Dão-Touriga Nacional

"Light in color and flavor, this is a ghost of a wine, with pale fruitiness and acidity, with a fleeting texture.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This intriguing and delicious wine includes 15% Viognier, the two grapes spending nine months in French oak, only 30% of it new. The oak provides structure and strength in unobtrusive ways, allowing the freshness of pomelo and grapefruit to speak and remain tangy against a tease of vanilla. The finish is dry and lengthy.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"So rich and ripe in fruit, you almost don't notice that it's also a complicated and layered wine in structure. Blackberry marmalade, cassis and cocoa flavors are balanced despite hefty alcohol. An extraordinarily delicious wine, but it's meant to be enjoyed in its youth. Drink up by 2016.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The steep slopes of the Himmelreich provided some wonderful wines in 2005, and Raimund Prüm's offering has turned out well.

"Lean, dry raspberry aromas and a slight floral essence carry the nose toward a zesty, semisharp palate with crisp cherry and cranberry flavors. Not bad in a lean, stripped-back way; but there's no excess oak, weight or sweetness. Lean stuff for old-school palates nursing plates of ham or salami.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of tobacco, dried herbs and strawberry are followed by focused, creamy-feeling raspberry and cranberry flavors. It shows a real sense of purity but the mouthfeel is where it truly shines.",US-Washington-Grenache
"Herb, currant, vanilla and tire-rubber aromas are at the fore. The blackberry flavors drink off dry, sweetening toward the finish.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Fermented with 100% stems and aged in neutral French oak, this textbook example of this top Syrah site brings aromas of smoked meat, purple fruit, crushed violets and fresh parsley along with other green herbs. The palate's über-fresh fruit and savory flavors are supported by tart bright acids. This one will only get better with some bottle age and will truly shine at the dinner table. Best from 2022 through 2030.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Ripe and fruity, this wine offers crisp apples and pear-juice flavors. It has a strongly tangy element that is refreshing and delicious now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Starts off with slightly confected yet delicious aromas of cherries, almond paste and vanilla, but turns slightly more savory on the palate, where it picks up some herbal shadings. This is relatively light in body, with a crisp structure that suggests it may last longer than most Marlborough Pinots; drink now–2017.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir

"This Tempranillo gives off intense aromatics of ripe berry pie and has a crisp, smoky finish. In between it's big and brawny, delicious and rustic around the edges. On second sip, the flavors are wrapped in vanilla-kissed oak.",US-California-Tempranillo
"There have been Estate Selection Chards from Cuvaison before, but never a block bottling. This wine fully merits its status and price. Tightly angular and acidic in youth, it's very minerally, with a gunmetal tang to the oak-infused Meyer lemon, green apple and green pear flavors. One of the rare California Chardonnays not ready on release, this Chablis-style wine will be best in mid-2008, and should develop for another few years.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This pure, supple, fruit-laden Syrah is loaded with wild blackberry fruit, and detailed veins of licorice, coffee, and iron filings. The wine's excellent length and polished tannins showcase exceptional handling of superb fruit.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Here's a full-bodied, succulent wine with a sunny character that opens with aromas of perfumed berry, blue flower and a hint of cake spice. The smooth, structured palate doles out juicy dark cherry, crushed plum and a hint of mocha alongside velvety tannins. This is already enjoyable but will age well for several years.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Cassis and blackberry aromas are bold and show a feral side as this breathes. Fresh and charged up on the palate, this hits with cassis and blackberry flavors in front of a fruity, not oaky finish. Drink this pleasurable, well-made Malbec now through 2017.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This hedonistically powerful mix of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot traffics in blackberry and black cherry jam over a layer of soft tannins.

"This is tutti-frutti in scent, with a pear drop note that is loud and clear. It's light to medium in body, lacking some focus and concentration.",US-Virginia-Rosé

"It's very good, with deep, delicious flavors of tropical fruits, minerals and vanilla, accented with elaborate oak and brightened with crisp acidity. Production was a low 223 cases, but it's worth a search.",US-California-Chardonnay

It is a generous wine, still young and best from 2016.",Portugal-Dão-Portuguese White
"With its sugary flavors of oranges, guavas and vanilla, this will appeal to those who favor sweet white wines. Brisk, clean acidity fortunately provides balance.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"A cool, very Sauvignon wine, with strong herbaceous and citrus flavors. It's crisp, showing a bright, tight, slightly mineral texture.",France-Bordeaux-Sauvignon Blanc
A lovely notion of ripe mirabelle and clean citrus makes for an appealing nose. The palate highlights the mirabelle with a honeyed rich sweetness that is juicy and appetizing. A touch of spice seems reminiscent of dark fir honey. The lemon brightens and invigorates this full-fruited richness. The finish is long and medium-sweet.,France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer

"Sunny yet spry, this invigorating Kabinett offers a crush of ripe tangerine, quince and yellow cherry flavors. Pert acidity cuts through all the fruity richness, extending a lean, sumptuously sweet finish. It's delightful already, but should develop well through 2025.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling

With smoothly polished tannins giving it a full-bodied mouthfeel, this single-vineyard wine has rich blackberry, black currant and pepper flavors. Fine now, and should develop for many years.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"This wine's cranberry, orange peel and herb notes are atypical for the variety. Its fruit flavors are tart and elegant, needing a bit more structure to prop them up. It's a bit thin in concentration, with consistent orange peel flavors throughout.",US-Washington-Malbec
"Toasted bramble berry aromas come with hints of tree bark and mixed spices. This feels chewy, dense and round, while flavors of roasted plum and berry are well spiced. The chewy, round, tannic finish is rooty and spicy.",Chile-Curicó Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Initially closed, this opens up slowly into a very bundled, concentrated yet fluid stream of citrus flesh and zest. There are overtones of kitchen herbs like chervil but lemony freshness trumps. There is a lightness of touch, a wonderful, lithe elegance and a lasting finish.",Austria-Kamptal-Riesling
"A diffuse wine without focus. The tannins and the fruit are some way apart, while the final flavor is dry and tough.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Subdued aromas suggest red berry and a hint of dried herb. The tight palate shows red raspberry, raw cherry and a hint of cinnamon while rather austere tannins and brisk acidity provide support.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend

"Pure Sauvignon Blanc, this is herbal while also crisp, very fruity, bright and lively. Gooseberry juice dominates this intense wine.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Run, don't walk, to buy this wonderful Merlot by the case. An unbelievable buy from Goldschmidt Vineyards, which is doing some of the most interesting things in Sonoma Bordeaux wines, it's a soft, ripe, complex wine that shows the balance and structure of a far more expensive bottling. Brims with briary cherry, blackberry, chocolate, cedar and spice flavors that were born for charbroiled steak.",US-California-Merlot
"Apple, peach and yeast aromas are welcoming but a little wayward. This brut nature shows roundness on the palate and no coarseness. Briny apple and dried-apricot flavors are calm on the finish.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"A clean and bright wine with focused acidity, this is a mouthful of lemon and lime flavors, with a hint of peach. With a handful of Chardonnay and Muscat in the mix, this is a great party or midweek white, but it's also fit for any special occasion.",US-California-Viognier

"From an estate vineyard located in the heart of Rutherford that was purchased by the producer in 2006, this vineyard-designate is the star of the show, a blend of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with 9% Cabernet Franc.

It should cellar well through 2021.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
Villa Novare offers a light and bright expression of Ripasso that ties nicely into Valpolicella tradition where the focus is on balance and elegance. You'll also enjoy the wine's food-friendly qualities such as its medium structure and smooth finish.,"Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
A light yellow-gold color and subtle savory aromas don't give away how luscious and sweet this wine is in flavor. It resembles concentrated honeydew melon and vanilla on a pillowy-soft texture that almost disappears on the finish.,US-California-Moscato
"This ruby-colored blend of Corvina and Sangiovese doesn't offer huge aromatic intensity, but it does deliver clean notes of cherry, dried fruit, spice and fresh tobacco leaf (it is aged in cherry wood casks).

It's a very good Pinot Noir, with varietally correct aromas and flavors that range from flowers to cherries, all framed by hints of coffee and vanilla.",Australia-South Australia-Pinot Noir
"This is a barrel selection, presumably limited in cases. It's an extraordinarily rich, concentrated 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, made in the modern cult-style of massively extracted blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and chocolate, with oak bringing the usual sweet toast and vanilla complexities. This deserves its high score for sheer opulence and great Napa structure. Delicious now, and could easily age for at least 10 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas suggesting underbrush, scorched earth, mature black-skinned fruit and a whiff of dried mint jump out of the glass.

"Made by a Nevada-based producer, this rosé from California-grown Grenache is very dark, exuding aromas of grenadine syrup and does follow through on the theme of sweet and viscous on the palate.",US-California-Rosé
"Leathery cherry and plum aromas offer a hint of tobacco as well as a burnt, roasted note. This is healthy in feel, with lively, snappy acidity. Flavors of herbs, vanilla, tomato, tobacco and red currant finish wiry and high-toned, with moderate tartness and plenty of length. Drink through 2023.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Smooth, tropical and pure on the nose, with pineapple as the lead fruit. The palate is solid and full-bodied, with pineapple, papaya, honey and toasted flavors. Not “oaky” but it is well oaked, and thus the finish is warm, toasty and creamy. Drink now.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"Made with organically cultivated Corvina and Rondinella grapes, this spicy red boasts aromas and flavors of Marasca cherry, clove and ground pepper. It's smooth and juicy, with supple tannins. A tobacco note signals the close.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Spicy black fruit, with bell pepper, black pepper and toast adding complexity. Partial whole-berry fermentation brings an element of spicy, forward fruitiness to the wine. Lively mouthfeel, with some heat and lift to the finish. If there were more depth and punch to the fruit, this would warrant an even higher rating.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Ample vanilla notes from oak aging mark the nose and palate of this savory Shiraz. It's on the full side for the Hunter, with a rich texture and a long, velvety finish. Drink 2015–2025.",Australia-New South Wales-Shiraz

"Sweet and fragrant, floral and fruity, this Prosecco Extra Dry (with 10% Pinot Bianco) has a feminine, creamy disposition and excellent harmony of aromas and effervescence. It's very filling in the mouth with generous accents of stone fruit and honey; “47” marks the year the winery was founded.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco

"Lots of ripe blackberry, cherry, currant, licorice and cedar flavors in this dry, tannic wine. It's a little rude in texture, with a jagged mouthfeel that could age out, but you never know. Give it a good long decant before serving.",US-California-Red Blend
"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this wine is all about fresh, vibrant fruit. Limes, Meyer lemons, gooseberries, Asian pears and something tropical, like papayas, all mingle together. Aging on the lees, which is a popular intervention in many unoaked white wines, gives additional notes of cream and sourdough.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
This quickly veers from being delicately light into simply sour and grassy. Cucumber- and tart melon-flavored fruit fades into a short finish.,US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Using grapes sourced from the greatest white-wine vineyard in Burgundy, this is huge, dense, very rich and complex. The balance already shows in the wine's acidity, ripe yellow fruit and round texture. Wood aging brings notes of spice and toast. This will age for many years.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"Intentionally skewed toward the drier side of kabinett, this is an impressive effort from proprietor Raimund Prüm. It's light in body, with fairly ripe fruit flavors of honeyed apple and a hint of apricot, yet intensely refreshing thanks to crisp acidity. Drink now.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling

It shows plenty of acidity, and the apricot, orange, mango and honey flavors are enhanced with a stony minerality that create elegance.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Jammy but generic berry fruit aromas are crowded by lactic, pasty oak scents and vanilla. The wine is hard as cement in the mouth, with jagged tannins. Flavors of sun-baked raisin and plum fold in chocolate and rubbery notes on a grabby finish that includes residual resiny oak. This could use more time; try after 2016.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"This opens with a blast of espresso bean that lends a modern twist. The oak tones are softened by wild berry and licorice notes. The mouthfeel is steely, fresh and firm.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"Michael Gill goes for broke booze-wise on this hot number, but the rewards are worth the risk. Aromas of blueberry, mint, graphite, dried cherry, lilac and graphite get a sagebrush lift. On the palate, distinct black licorice accompany blackberry syrup and white pepper. There's a slight bit of alcoholic burn on the finish, but it doesn't drink as hot as you'd guess.",US-California-Syrah

"This is a big, hard, tannic wine. It's so buttoned up, the question is whether it will age. Most of the signs say yes. It's gigantically rich in blackberries, cassis and chocolate, with a berried sweetness accented by the caramel of toasted oak. Acidity is just fine. On the other hand, the alcohol is notable, giving it peppery heat. A very fine, flashy, impressive wine, but its future is obscure.",US-California-Claret

"This is one of the best California Chardonnays in its price range. It's not a rich wine; instead, it's dry, crisply acidic and minerally, with citrus zest, vanilla cream and subtle oak flavors. With 65,000 cases produced, this should be easy to find.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This wine's elevated—for a fruchtig German Riesling—alcohol level (11.5%) and botrytis-influenced flavors of dried apricots and orange marmalade suggest early consumption, although some may want to see if it settles down in another five years. It's fat, oily and rich right now, and a bit warming on the finish.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Very dry and quite acidic, this racy Chardonnay has a Chablis-like minerality that suggests chalk and steel. That may come from the grapes that were grown in the far southerly part of the valley. An equal percentage hails from warmer St. Helena, and they seem to have contributed the pears and peaches.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Concentrated aromas of pomegranate, cranberry and mulberry meet with broodingly spiced notes of cola, pencil shavings, dried mint and mossy earth on the nose of this bottling. Juniper, pine needle tea and redwood flavors show on the sip, giving depth to a clean line of dark-red fruit and woody, black-pepper-flecked spice.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"This opens with fragrant aromas of yellow rose, apricot, butterscotch and spicy vanilla. It has edium density, with a fresh mouthfeel lending this a unique personality.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Some unripe flavors suggest green mint and asparagus. They limit the score, despite some good blackberry tea, currant and white-pepper flavors. Drink up.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Ripe pomegranate seeds, red cherry juice, chai tea, a touch of iron and a stemmy crushed herb element powers the nose on this bottling from a special part of the estate vineyard. The flavors are sanguine at first, then open up onto red fruits, but are all held together by crushed marjoram and thyme.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Half Syrah, a quarter Cabernet Sauvignon and the balance a mixture of other varieties, this wine offers fresh and dried black fruit accented by cocoa and vanilla. It's plush in feel with red and black fruit flavors that bring plenty of appeal.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"The low-yielding vines average 35 years of age, and their flavors are subtle yet distinctive. This wine unfolds slowly and almost imperceptibly, with subtle minerality around flavors of citrus pith and rind. It's tart and racy, with a lick of Key lime through the finish.",Canada-Ontario-Riesling
"Scents and flavors suggest cherry pipe tobacco, along with streaks of dried leaf and lemon oil. It's a rough and tumble, every day red, with some chewy tannins.",US-Oregon-Cabernet Sauvignon

"With a little airing, this wakes up to reveal dark red cherries held in a taut and firm body that nonetheless has a generous core. There is some gentle grip and frank, firm acidity. It's a very honest wine without any baroque frills—but bags of forthright appeal.",France-Alsace-Pinot Noir
There's a tiny touch of apple skin volatility and fresh raspberry that give this wine enormous lift and buoyancy. But there are also grounding aromas of leather and old spice that render a sense of intensity and sophistication.,Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Smoke, candlewax and lemon zest lend savory tones to fresh lemon and apple flavors in this brisk off-dry wine. It's piercingly tart with a hit of lime acidity on the midpalate, but a waxy richness adds body and mouthfeel. The moderately long finish carries a hint of honeysuckle perfume.",US-New York-Riesling
"A brawny bottling from one of the state's most historic vineyards, this wine offers wild berries, turned earth, shiitake mushrooms and a light cinnamon glaze on the hearty nose. Rich cherry and plum fruit shows on the tip of the sip followed by rising waves of anise, eucalyptus and white sage. The mouthfeel is soft but with aggressive acidity.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"The lifted nose promises purity, which the palate follows thorough on, with the gentle fruit of ripe pear and mirabelle plum and the softer freshness of ripe lemon. There is just a smattering of white pepper. All is held with great poise and freshness, and there is something utterly clean and pure about this.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"Cascina Ballarin's Barolo Bricco Rocca comes from the La Morra area of the Langhe and offers intense aromas of blue flower, violets, almond flowers, cinnamon and powdered licorice. The focus here is on elegance and harmony and the mouthfeel follows through with power and determination. This is a truly beautiful wine",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Hazy layers of smoke and struck flint permeate amidst pristine gooseberry and white grapefruit in this late release bottling, lending an early glimpse into its development. It's a complex dry Riesling mingling elements of earth, fruit and flower into a silken tonic catapulted by jolts of zest and acidity. Lithe and lean, it finishes with a long, mineral repose. Alluring already but should drink well through 2030 at least.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"This wine feels hard with bitter extraction that detracts from its fruitiness. There is a very dense texture that could soften over time, although bitterness could remain a problem.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A beautiful Gewürz that could get more people to drink this Alsatian variety. It's dry and crisp, with rich flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, honeysuckle flowers, lychee nuts, vanilla and Asian spices.",US-California-Gewürztraminer
"There's zero doubt about this Chardonnay's ripeness. The nose is warm, honeyed and a bit leaden. Round in the mouth, it offers tropical flavors of orange and nectarine. On the finish, a buttery note blends with residual citrus fruit.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Chardonnay

"This is a really fun dry wine with a distinctive black-pepper streak running from the aroma to the finish. It's medium bodied, on the lean side in texture, like pomegranate in terms of fruit flavors, firmly tannic and well-balanced. It should make a great pairing with steak au poivre.",US-California-Red Blend
"Again in 2009, winemaker Casey McClellan has crafted a beautifully pure Cabernet Sauvignon from this vineyard. Soft and supple, focused and detailed, it's a riot of pastry-like berries and cherries, with a concentrated midpalate bursting with full-bodied flavor. It moves into a lengthy finish, with toast, tobacco, coconut and caramel highlights.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Penetrating aromatically, spicy and complex, this brings in sharp berry scents, baking chocolate and a streak of herb. It's tight and vertically structured, and once in the mouth it turns a bit hard and unyielding. But it lingers and resonates, improves after being open for several hours, and can be cellared for up to a decade.",US-Washington-Merlot
"This is a blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Sangiovese and 20% Zinfandel. Spicy, light and fruity, it sports plenty of acid beneath tart red fruits. The addition of Sangiovese gives it a little bit of leather and toast for added interest.",US-Oregon-Red Blend

"The heat and glycerine of high alcohol are integral parts of this 100% Syrah. The wine is big, juicy, jammy and frankly delicious, offering endless waves of cassis, chocolate, blueberries, black licorice, black pepper and vanilla-scented oak that last through a long, spicy finish. Drink now–2016.",US-California-Syrah
"Pure Touriga Nacional with the grape's characteristic perfumes, this is firm and still dense. Tannins abound along with the blackberry fruit. The aftertaste, with its acidity, promises more aging, so drink from 2018.",Portugal-Lisboa-Touriga Nacional
"Warm, sweet aromas of pear, apple and buttered toast crawl all over the nose. Like most Argentinean Chardonnays, this shows creamy white-fruit flavors and noted sweetness. It's fairly rich but not complex or layered. Drink soon for maximum freshness.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
Honeysuckle notes waft gorgeously from this summery off-dry Riesling full of juicy tangerine and stone fruit flavors. Bright citrus acidity balances a palate that's rich and round with a waxy slick that lingers deliciously through the finish.,Germany-Rheinhessen-Riesling
"Zesty Gala apple and squeezed tangerine aromas come through on this wine's citrusy nose, though it also shows riper nectarine, honeysuckle and chalky depth. The mineral flair continues onto the palate, where mandarin orange flavors meet with apple in the midpalate, bound together by a grapefruit pith texture.",US-California-Viognier
"You get a lot of bang for your buck with this dry, complex young Syrah. Although the tannic structure is rich and sturdy, it shows a wealth of blackberry, black currant, grilled meat and pepper flavors. Drink now through 2010.",US-California-Syrah
"Coming from a vineyard in The Rocks, this wine opens with aromas of savory herbs and moist earth, with flower petal and piercing cherry notes lurking the background. The palate is velvety in feel, putting a focus on elegance. It shows plenty of hang time on the finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Nice manners and medium body make this an easy-drinking, lighter wine. The aromas are like cherries and strawberries, the fruit flavors are almost sweet, and the texture is soft and smooth.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This is an irresistibly tasty wine, bursting with lovely berry and cherry fruits, soaked in deliciously decadent chocolaty barrel flavors. But it's not that simple. Propped up with sufficient acidity, ripe tannins and a slight tilt toward earthy underpinnings, it offers compelling length and complexity also. Drink now through 2022.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"To call this Cabernet huge is an understatement. The tannins are hard and dramatic. As for the fruit, you can hardly find strong enough descriptors. It shows blackberry jam and black currants, cassis liqueur and minerals raised to fabulous mountain concentration. Violets and oak add to the equation. Somehow it all balances out, resulting in a wine of unusual grace and power. But it needs age. Drink 2019–2031, if not beyond.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This lightly herbal wine is crisp and has a tangy mineral character. It's tight, green and full of citrus fruits. The acidity is right up front, keeping the wine fresh and bright at the end.",France-France Other-Sauvignon Blanc
"This radiant white opens with scents of stone fruit, blackcurrant, crushed herb and cut grass while the vibrant palate doles out honeydew melon, white peach, mineral and a hint of sage. Crisp acidity leaves a clean, tangy finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"Creamy berry and plum aromas register as generic and inoffensive. This is round and full in terms of weight and texture, with herbal, jammy flavors of berry fruits and salt. An herbal, oaky, salty tasting finish is solid but fails to elevate things.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Done in a ripe and fleshy style, this vintage is in its prime drinking window. Mixed peach, lemon, stone and citrus fruit, along with a slice of honeydew melon, make this a mouth-filling, all-purpose Riesling, with barely perceptible sweetness.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"From its privileged position right next to the grand cru of La Tâche, Aux Malconsorts has produced a heady, perfumed wine, relatively delicate, relying on its succulent red fruits to give body. It is on the sweet side of Pinot Noir, jammy with red berry flavors, and already delicious.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"A bit heavy and jammy on the nose. The palate is more pointed and acidic, with flavors of roasted berry, herbal plum and spice. Turns more juicy and acid-driven as it opens, and then finishes herbal, spicy and grabby.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Piercing aromas of red-berry fruits and red-apple skins are a touch rough but improve with airing. This feels fresh, medium in size, and tastes of herbal plum and cherry prior to a lightly herbal finish.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Substantive in oak and weight, this concentrated, estate-grown wine is impressive in velvety texture and a savory conjuring of tobacco and black tea. Dark, brambly blackberry and dark cherry join in on the fun, providing vibrancy amid all the sophistication. Finishing with a dash of cardamom, this wine will cellar nicely through 2020.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"So ripe and full in the mouth, this is a beautiful wine. It has great layers of spice, yellow fruits, and refreshing acidity and concentration. Dense and multidimensional, it's both a mineral and fruit driven wine. This needs good aging over 4–6 years.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"This shows light, tangy cranberry and raspberry flavors on the fresh, straightforward attack. Beyond that, it doesn't offer much detail, finishing with a touch of acidity.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Mouthfilling, mouthcoating and full bodied, this dark-colored wine blends ripe but not sweet blackberry and black-cherry flavors with dark chocolate and baking-spice nuances for a complex and delicious taste profile. It's rich enough in flavor and viscous enough in texture that the abundant tannins seem to be absorbed, and the mouthfeel is soothing. Best from 2018–2023.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Enticing aromas of woodland berry, dark baking spice and a hint of tobacco float out of the glass. The medium-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, star anise, coffee and a hint of orange zest set against a backbone of polished tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2018–2024.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This broad-shouldered, burly and feral wine is ripe with smoky cherry and vanilla notes. Smoothly textured, it imparts dusty leather and black licorice accents amid a serious slathering of oak.",US-California-Syrah
"This wine's aromas are a bit locked up at present, revealing plum, herb, clove and barrel spice notes as it opens. The palate is dense and rich, full of dark fruit flavors and generous barrel accents. It pulls no punches.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This full-flavored and full-bodied wine is certainly a change of pace. It smells almost like eucalyptus, tastes powerfully fruity and floral, has a slight sweetness balanced by good acidity, and finishes with an intriguing mineral quality.",US-California-Viognier
"Profoundly mineral tones of earth and dust mingle with lychee and rose petal throughout this dry, light-bodied, yet brooding Gewürztraminer. The palate is marked with classic varietal notes of potpourri, stone fruit and spice, but they're uniquely exaggerated, with a deeply phenolic, bitter overtone that builds. Overall, it presents a fascinating play between the classic and unique.",US-New York-Gewürztraminer
"Black cherry aromas are grapy and simple, with spice and forced oak notes chiming in. This feels rugged with firm tannins. Short, spicy black cherry flavors finish with a lasting burn.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"At 62,000-plus cases, you are in the land of the seamless blend. Oregon does not have vast contiguous vineyards, so these grapes must have come from here, there and everywhere. The result is a gentle, lightly fruity, crisp, clean and innocuous Pinot Noir that lacks only a sense of place.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Only if you enjoy very lean, ultrafresh and tart red wines will this work. It starts with simple punchbowl aromas of red grapes and berry, and then comes a skinny, tart, grating palate that's all acid and no substance. Calling it “traditional” or a “terroir” wine would only be misleading.",Spain-Levante-Monastrell
"Aromas of beach tar and blackberry jam show on the nose of this wine from White Hawk Vineyard by Clarissa Nagy, also winemaker at Riverbench. The palate is also quite tarry, with concentrated blackberry flavors, hints of teriyaki and a strong acidic backbone.",US-California-Syrah
"A severe sense of funk and sweat is the aromatic greeting on this Sauvignon Blanc-Semillón blend. A crisp, citric palate tastes green, like lime and tarragon. On the finish, this is tight and stony, with overt citric acidity.",Spain-Catalonia-White Blend
"Smooth beyond its youthful age, this is sparked to life with peppery highlights dappling a pretty, cherry-candy fruit core. Lighter accents of cola and cocoa follow up through a medium-long finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"This well-made wine brings briary, brambly notes to its core raspberry fruit. The impression of light herbaceousness continues through a medium-long finish, with a hint of thistle and wet stone. The wine spent 10 months in 50% new French oak.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A good, everyday sort of Zin, dry and fruity. It has a rich tannic structure, with spicy cherry, tangerine, currant, cola and cocoa flavors.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This is a structured wine that still has serious layers of ripe fruit and rich tannins. The black currant from the Cabernet Sauvignon is balanced by the jammy richness of the delicious Merlot. It's an impressive wine that continues the progress of this estate, owned by Lafite-Rothschild. Drink from 2024.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Sourced from what is arguably Red Willow's finest block of Syrah, this is superbly balanced and remarkably concentrated for this cool site from a cool vintage. Cassis fruit is streaked with licorice and mocha, showing plenty of new oak influence without sacrificing depth or fruit. Drink soon or tuck it away for a few more years; either way it's a gem.",US-Washington-Syrah
"While the wine is dominated by flavors of wood aging, it also has fine fruit weight that will come through. Then it will be a powerful and concentrated wine, rich and full of blackberry and black plum fruits. The structure will keep this fruitiness in order. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This single-vineyard wine from Foxen's estate is a little too sweet. It seems to contain residual sugar, to judge by the jellied pineapple and apricot flavors. If you don't mind that, you'll find a crisply acidic, clean wine, with oak and lees complexities.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This smoky wine has firm tannins and a tough core. The juicy fruit is taking its time develop, although it will provide density and ripe berry fruits in time. The vineyard, created in the early 1980s, is now at peak maturity. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Light in color and light-bodied in the mouth, this Grenache-based Rhône blend offers easy, sweet flavors of cherries, cola, vanilla and oak.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
Juicy black cherry is the main theme here: it fills nose and palate. The body lacks a little focus but its fleshiness is cut by freshness that sets all the cherry fruit into scene.,Austria-Burgenland-Blaufränkisch
"A classically powerful Riserva from Antinori, produced from the three family estates at Tignanello, Pèppoli and Badia a Passignano. Aromas of violets and cherries are followed by tobacco and spice flavors from the wood, as well as concentrated black fruits. Rich and full-bodied, it should age well over the next 10 years.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese

"So light that it's like water in the glass, this is a dynamic wine, with aromas of sugared lime peels, lime blossoms and a touch of quinine. The palate is reminiscent of a gin & tonic cocktail, with icy lime juice and lots of botanical influence.",US-California-Riesling
"Bright and cheerful with a candied black cherry nose, this is a deliciously fruit-forward yet focused wine. On the palate, soft, fresh fruit and supple vanilla flavors meld beautifully with supple tannins and a rich, dark, roasted coffee finish.",US-New York-Merlot
"A 50-50 Cabernet/Syrah blend, this is heavily tannic. The cherry-cola flavor is smothered in char, smoke and bitter espresso. This needs a big thick steak to cut through the tannins.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This serious, ripe offering is packed with red berry and stone fruit flavors. It also has complex touches of toast and acidity, producing a sense of dryness. This is finely balanced and is now ready to drink, but it will also likely age for a few more years.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"At first this shows some earthy, volatile aromas. The mineral-driven palate has tart, slightly bitter fruit flavors, suggesting crabapple and wild berry.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Freshly cut red, yellow and green apples make both nose and palate very fruity. The dry palate with its lemony freshness and open aspect lets all the apple flavors shine and inflects them here and there with baked and dried apple, too. Wonderfully fruity and pure.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It leans slightly into the green, with aromas of fresh herbs mixed with vanilla, chocolate and other barrel spices. The palate is elegant, with a soft feel to the chocolate, cherry and barrel flavors.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A fresh smell like just-baked bread and terrific flavors like Bing cherry and spiced plums make a great combination in this medium- to full-bodied wine. The texture is firm with fine tannins, but so supple that you hardly notice them.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"With its wonderful, heady aromas of red fruits and sweet jelly, this is already a delicious wine before the first sip. Then the exuberant fruits kick in with flavors of red berries, strawberries and sweet plums. As a balance, there is firm structure, minerality and fine finishing acidity.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Pale pink in the glass, this Pinot Noir-based rosé combines nectarine and watermelon aromas with a citrus spray and rose petal quality that provides both depth and tang on the nose. There is a good charge of acidity on the palate, as well as a grippy texture, while light stone fruit, mandarin orange and lime flavors prove quite mellow yet delicious.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This ripe, generous wine is full of the bold red fruits of this fine vintage. It also has structure, spicy wood flavors and a rich, full character. With its juicy acidity in the background and its impressive density, the wine is going to age a little longer. It will be best from late 2018.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Ignore its generic Oregon AVA—this is King Estate's top wine, a rich reserve-level Pinot Noir redolent with Asian spices, saffron, cumin and more. Nuances of dusty cocoa powder lead into a thrilling wine with a spine of steel, focusing its ripe, fleshy fruit through a long, cellar-worthy finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Ashen mineral tones and stone fruit are backed by thick notes of milky honey and cream. This vineyard-designate Greco di Tufo is very crisp and tonic with lingering citrus flavors. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.",Italy-Southern Italy-Greco

"This full-bodied wine is packed with fruit and spice notes and is especially broad and mouth-filling.

"Value and quality come with Faustino's 2007 rosé. Red licorice nibs, spice and cherry-raspberry aromas set it off in the right direction.

It's the type of dry rosé that we want to drink.",Spain-Northern Spain-Rosé
"Faiveley owns two acres of this large Grand Cru vineyard. This 2011 is a big, bold and fruity wine that shows red fruits, a sweet texture and good acidity.

"Yellow flower, Mediterranean herb, cut grass, crisp green apple, juicy citrus and intense mineral are some of the sensations offered by this structured and savory white. It boasts great depth and is impeccably balanced with vibrant acidity. Enjoy through 2021.",Italy-Southern Italy-Fiano
"The vineyard is on Howell Mountain. It's an awkward wine, with lots to like, but some problems. On the plus side is enormous  cassis, cherry and chocolate fruit flavor and rich, fine tannins, and the 100% new oak seems proper given the wine's volume. But there's too much sugary sweetness in the finish, almost like a dessert wine.",US-California-Merlot
"Released young, this fresh and citrusy wine is all about the fruit. Full in the mouth, it quickly settles into a cherry vanilla mid-palate, and sails on through a clean finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Like a well-made café latte, this wine balances the dry and restrained elements against creamy, mocha nuances that round out the texture and bring an almost sweet, jammy taste to the finish. Just substitute rich blackberry for coffee flavors to make the analogy work.",US-California-Zinfandel

It's full and lush, with flavors of lemon, grainy oak, coffee and charred black fruit. Dark, oaky and charred on the finish, it needs a lot of air. Predominantly Malbec, with small additions of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Malbec
"Crisp and tightly wound, this is a relatively austere Cabernet with an astringent finish. Cassis emerges with enough airing, accompanied by tart cranberries, which act to accentuate the drying tannins. Try after 2020.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This smells toasted and heady, with a baked apple aroma. The mouthfeel is full, while the flavors tend toward citrus and pith. Solid on the finish.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"On the palate, this wine is rich and complex, with flavors of dried cherry, cola, licorice, red currant and sandalwood that finish bone dry. It has lots of acidity and some sandpaper-like tannins. This should begin to develop bottle-age notes after 2016.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Lots of dry elegance in this wine. It's also more acidic than your typical Napa Cabernet, with a tart bite. The tannins are young and forceful, and the finish is totally dry. As presently constituted, it's somewhat tough and lean. But the core of cherries and blackberries suggests some degree of ageabilty. Hold until 2015.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Cracked pepper and black olive aromas give this wine a savory cast, and they're followed up on the palate by hints of charred meat. It's medium-bodied and supple, with a soft, slightly diffuse finish that suggests drinking not cellaring. Drink now–2025.",France-Rhône Valley-Syrah

"The historic Dr. Konstantin Frank winery has long been a source for consistent, well-priced wines in the Finger Lakes. Pretty on the nose, with delicate floral and stone-fruit aromas, it builds in intensity and power on the palate, with a crush of sweet-tart grapefruit and nectarine flavors. Hints of fresh herb, honeycomb and zippy lemon-lime acidity add nuance and balance to a long finish.",US-New York-Riesling
"Like any good Bonarda, this is a tough wine. But on the other hand, it's flush, very dark and full of black-fruit flavors and texture. The nose is piercing but honest, while the palate is big and fleshy, with firm tannins, extract and bright black cherry and blackberry flavors. Thick throughout, with bacony notes to the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Bonarda
"Fragrant lemon blossom, citrus, beeswax and almond aromas carry over to the bright palate along with juicy lime, nectarine zest and dried herb. It finishes on a tangy saline note.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Grillo

"A little air is all that is needed to shake the orange and lemon zest flavors awake. This is a feast of ripe citrus: crisp, slender and very, very appetizing. The palate is streamlined and full of drive, with added complexity and texture from lees. Keep sipping to taste all the nuances of citrus—yuzu, tangerine, lemon and bergamot. This poised, pure beauty is delicious now but will last. Drink now till 2025.",Austria-Kamptal-Riesling

"This is a dense, flavorful and powerfully structured wine, brimming with notes of black cherry, plum, currant, baking spice, black pepper, crushed violet and bittersweet chocolate. It's full and chewy on the palate, with a firm structure and gripping tannins. Hints of licorice root, mocha and toasted sweet spice unfold on the finish. It's delicious now, but it should hold well through 2020.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is 100% varietal, coming from the esteemed Seven Hills Vineyard. The wine offers nuanced aromas of cherry meats and an herbal top note. The cranberry and cherry flavors are elegant, soft and sumptuous, showing a compelling styling and an impeccable sense of balance that carries all the way through the finish. Cabernet has seldom seemed so pretty.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A tribute to winemaker Steve Leveque, whose name in French means “the bishop,” this is a layered and powerful 100% varietal wine. It's generous in blackberry and black-cherry jam on toast, with a side flavor of coconut macaroon. Drink now through 2022.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"A touch of smoke is all that appears on the nose of this tight and taut wine. Acidity and slight tannic grip provide a structure and frame its lovely, tart but dark fruit that recalls fresh blueberries tinged with peppery spice. Crunchy, classy and moreish.",Austria-Burgenland-Blaufränkisch
"Massive chocolate, black cherry and cassis flavors mark this Cab, not to mention a liberal quantity of sweet, toasty oak. Although it's dry, it tastes as sweet as a dessert pastry. Not an ager, it should be opened by 2016.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Don Bosco offers gritty aromas of crushed stone, leather and spice, followed by blackberry and cherry liqueur. There are touches of smoke, cola and barbecue sauce; and it finishes slightly short.",Italy-Central Italy-Montepulciano
"The high alcohol gives this wine glycerine-driven sweetness and Port-like heat. With its raisin and chocolate flavors, this is Mazzocco's signature style.",US-California-Zinfandel
"An opening of apricot and peach aromas is proper, while the palate delivers a jolt of zest and acidity to more pineapple, lime and punchy green-apple flavors. Tangy later on, with more than a drop of lemon and lime to the finish. Also slightly pithy and bitter, which is natural for Godello.",Spain-Northern Spain-Godello
"Although only medium in body, this comes across as slightly heavy. Ripe flavors of nectarine, pineapple and mixed citrus are attractive, but lack refreshing zip on the finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc

"Spice rules this pure, estate-grown Syrah, which boasts a classic nose with streaks of compost, cured meats and oolong tea.

"This is a sound example of the warm-climate style of Zinfandel. It's high alcohol gives it a hot, chili-pepper-like sting, and the blackberry fruit has a Port-like, raisiny edge.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A balsamic note of menthol, dark culinary spice, crushed herb, new leather and wild berry aromas come together in the glass. Firmly structured but extraordinarily refined, the palate doles out red cherry, crushed strawberry, tobacco and cinnamon set against tightly woven refined tannins. Lively acidity lends balance and energy while a licorice note wraps around the lingering finish. Drink 2025–2043.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Bricco dell'Uccellone is an historic wine that shaped the modern history of Barbera d'Asti and Piedmont in general.

"A blend of Castelão and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a soft and smooth wine. Red berry fruits are balanced by spice and tannins from a short time in oak. The wine is ready to drink, although waiting until late 2016 would make it even more enjoyable.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
"Firmly tannic and still dominated by new wood, this is dense and brooding. It has the typically mineral feel of a fine Douro wine. Concentrated, brambly fruits and a powerful structure make this a wine that needs to age for at least five years.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"A cheerful super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this shows a very elegant and sophisticated side. It is modern, plump and extracted, but it also delivers fine aromas of cherry, vanilla, spice and pipe tobacco.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This old-vine (planted 1972) Pinot offers delicate, yet complex details throughout the palate. It's elegant winemaking at its best—a pinpoint mix of herb, stone, berry and barrel—seamless and precise. Despite (or perhaps because of?) the low alcohol, this has the potential to age; try after 2018.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Ripe tropical fruits star in this opulent, bold wine. The acidity is there, just enough to give this rich wine the support it needs. It is a complete wine—ripe and spicy, just give it some more time. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"This international venture based out of the former Nepenthe winery in the Adelaide Hills sources fruit from a number of vineyards in South Australia.

"Stalky aromas of burnt hay blend with white fruit scents. Bland apple and stalky flavors are balanced by decent acidity, then finishes with burnt, oily accents.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay

"Smooth and supple, with loads of juicy, ripe blackberry and plum flavors, this full-bodied, luscious red is another great bang-for-your-buck Georgian offering.

"Tropical aromas of lychee are about all that stand out on the nose of this unusual Moscatel-Garnacha Blanca blend. Neither dry nor sweet, this seems caught in no man's land. A dilute mouthfeel and bitter pyrazine notes on the finish don't help this along.",Spain-Northern Spain-White Blend
"There's a ton of inviting baking spices on the nose of this bottling, from crushed clove to nutmeg, as well as lushly stewed strawberries, bacon fat and purple flowers. It's rich and thick once sipped, certainly not a dainty wine, with baked black cherry and mace spice flavors proving hearty and delicious.",US-California-Pinot Noir
This fits properly into the brut nature category courtesy of neutral aromas and a direct tightly built palate. Mild citrus and melon flavors lose some clarity on a finish that hints at mealy apple and butter.,Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
This hot vintage Sangiovese plays an even game in terms of elegance and harmony. You need to give it some time before the cherry and vanilla nuances come to full force. The wine also builds on the palate thanks to its natural structure and persistence.,Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This is a solid, well-crafted and flavorful Malbec. Black fruit and cocoa aromas set up a concentrated palate, bearing chewy, dense flavors of black plum, wild berry and chocolate, plus toast and pepper notes. Production is 100,000-plus cases.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec

"Blackberry cordial leads in this fruit-driven wine, followed by vanilla, mocha, black olive and a bit of dusting polish. The palate is plush and brambly backed by a good grip of fine-grained tannins and a savory olive finish. This will cellar nicely. Drink now–2027.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"This is a lovely Morellino that delivers lively and easy aromas of cherry, blackberry and plum. As the wine is aged only in stainless steel to preserve its freshness, the integrity of the fruit is remarkable, and the mouthfeel is bright and focused.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Rose petal notes perfume this intensely aromatic rosé, accenting concentrated sour cherry and raspberry flavors. A robust blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it's dry in style but rich and ripe with fruit flavors. A hint of chalk and salinity mark the elegant finish.",US-New York-Rosé

"Pear candy and citrus peel beckon from the glass. There is a slightly candied edge to the expressive fruit, while the dryish palate shows concentration and warmth.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"A winning combination of seductive, spicy aromas and generous, well-developed fruit flavors make this wine hard to resist. It is full-bodied, dry and quite full-flavored, but without overdoing anything, so it's well balanced.",US-California-Barbera
"The peppery, berry-ish drive of this refreshing red is already evident on the nose. The body bursts with fruit and softness but has the pleasant, tartness of wild bilberries. What energy, what joy, what medium-bodied fun. Drink soon.",Austria-Burgenland-Blaufränkisch
"Tough, tannic and still young, this is a powerful and dense wine. Huge and concentrated black fruits are merged into dry tannins that are still waiting to soften. This ripe, potentially fruity wine needs to age for several years. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Dão-Portuguese Red
"There's a toothpasty sweetness to this Zin, like a raspberry mint candy. Also odd is that it's already throwing significant sediment even though it's still a young wine. Eccentric, but it has its charms.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Whole berry fermented and aged seven months in neutral oak, it shows appealing notes of dried herbs, raspberry and cherry. The palate is fruit focused with a abundant sweet raspberry flavors that linger on the finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"A bit thin on the blackberry fruit, and showing some veggie notes. Also pretty tannic. Might have seen its better days a year or so ago.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A little over half Syrah with a balance of Merlot, barrel fermented in French and American oak—20% new—it shows notes of clove, dusty spice, and blackberry. The palate is medium bodied and flavorful with slightly astringent tannins with tart cherry and cranberry notes on the finish.",US-Washington-Red Blend

"A touch of luscious peach plays amidst the ripe pear notes on the nose. The palate focuses on the ripe juicy pear fruit and counters this both with lovely lemony freshness and pleasantly bitter citrus pith. This is generous and friendly, easy to enjoy. The finish is off dry but has a fresh, appetizing finish.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"This mature PN from a hot vintage isn't showing much life. Earthy, raisiny aromas aren't fresh, while wood tannin and acid are keeping it afloat. Flavors of brown sugar and decayed berry fruits finish stale. This is on its very last legs.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir
"Winemaker Gustavo Gonzalez left Robert Mondavi to do his own thing, and what an auspicious start. He's taken fruit from this historic Carneros vineyard and crafted a big and bold yet balanced Pinot filled with lusciousness. The flavors are enormously complex, ranging from fresh raspberry jam and cranberries to red currants and persimmons. Earthy cola, mushroom and forest floor notes add complexity. The acid-tannin balance is just about perfect. Good as it is, this compelling Pinot should develop well over the next six years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Honeycrisp apples come to mind at first sip, along with dollops of peach, lemongrass and caramel. The mouthfeel is fresh and flavorful, with excellent texture and length.",US-Washington-White Blend
"So rich and powerful in fruit. Blackberry and cherry jam, mocha, cola, tobacco, black pepper, anise, licorice, beef jerky, it's all there, on steroids.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Pithy lime aromas get this fresh Chardonnay going. The palate is citrusy in feel, with a mix of lime, grapefruit and orange flavors that are limited in scope and complexity but clean.",Spain-Northern Spain-Chardonnay
"One sip is all it takes to know this is a terrific Pinot Noir. It's dry, silky and complex, and not only that, it will develop bottle nuance over the next six years. Rich and flamboyant in cherry pie filling, persimmon and mushu-plum sauce flavors, yet layered with earthy, foresty notes of mushrooms, soy sauce and balsam. You can drink it now, but give it an hour or two of decanting.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The aromas bring notes of herb, dark fruit and spice, seemingly a bit muddled. The palate packs a big mouthful of fruit and savory flavors that show a sense of purity, while bringing a lightly tacky feel. A lack of aromatic clarity holds it back.",US-Washington-Mourvèdre
"From a family-owned cru vineyard. Stéphane Aviron has produced an impressive, ripe and dense wine. It has great swathes of black fruit and generous acidity. The tannins, still young, are a background to this delicious fruitiness. Drink from 2020.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This is an elegant, lean wine, with earthy and smoky notes that just barely veer into melon. It’s dry and well structured, and has a nice balance of acids, sugar and alcohol. The finish is rich and toasty.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Pretty good, with ripe pineapple flavors brightened with crisp acidity. But the oak is too strong, coating the fruit with a heavy plaster of butterscotch and smoky caramel.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Another successful 2011 from this winery, in fact the best of their six new Pinots. Shows the brilliant acidity and light, delicate texture of the coast, with the concentrated fruit, cola and spice flavors this esteemed vineyard is noted for. Highly complex and dry, it's delicious to drink now, and should age well for a good six years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Quite vibrant and floral on the nose, this shows deep blackberry and both dried and fresh purple-flower elements as well as a baked berry pastry. The flavors are well integrated on the palate, where cooked blackberries in a vanilla pie crust combine with juicy strawberry, peppercorns and rosemary spice.",US-California-Syrah
"The vineyard is in a warmer part of the northern valley, and yet it shows brisk acidity and the cool-climate apricot, lime and white peach flavors of a long hangtime region. It's a fine Chardonnay, oaky and buttery, and provides pleasant drinking now.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Green apples, apple blossoms, fresh Meyer lemon, tangerine skin and a bit of chalk show on the complex nose of this bottling, which is boosted by 5% Viognier. The flavors are fairly light, with energetic lime juice, apple flesh and tart apple skins in the midpalate.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a crisp, green-fruited wine with all its flavors concentrated in a full, fruity character. It has citrus and lively mineral notes, with a juicy texture. Ripe and rich yet not heavy, it's almost drinkable now. Screwcap.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"This is a fine Brunello Riserva with a thick and pulpy feel that is accented by aromas of cherry, wild berries, currants, exotic spice and pipe tobacco. The wine is smooth and rich with enduring fruit notes and silky tannins. There is a pleasantly sweet note of cherry and vanilla on the long finish. Drink after 2012.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Atypical for the appellation in that it's 80% Syrah, this is a dark-fruited, slightly pruny Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Chocolate and licorice notes add complexity to this full-bodied, firmly structured wine. With its long, chewy finish, consider deferring consumption until at least 2014.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"With no oak influence, this Cabernet Franc is chock full of pristine raspberry and cherry notes. It's quite concentrated on the palate with deep, ripe red-fruit flavor, but marked by tart cranberry acidity and a long, lingering finish and just a hint of leafy green notes.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"There is light acidity on this fresh, gently fruity wine. It does have a textured edge with plum skin acidity and a fresh aftertaste.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Modest aromas of cut grass, white flower and citrus establish this as an easy-drinking white. The finish is marked with a touch of green lime. It should pair well with shrimp cocktail or basil pesto.",Italy-Veneto-Pinot Grigio

"A pure Sangiovese, this opens with varietal aromas including fragrant blue flowers, perfumed berries, tilled soil, forest floor and a whiff of cake spice.

"Using the four main grapes of the Dão region—Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Alfrocheiro and Jaen—this is an impressive wine, with solid tannins and a crushed-stone texture. Black currant fruits are set against perfumed acidity and a dense structure which needs to soften for the wine to be fully ready. Drink this wine from 2018.",Portugal-Dão-Portuguese Red
"Minerally on the bouquet, with apple and oceanic notes. Turns citric and acidic on the palate, with pineapple, orange and tangy flavors. Shows astringency on the finish, but at least it's juicy and driving.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"From the Evergreen Vineyard, in the Ancient Lakes region north of the Wahluke Slope, this is surprisingly high-powered, at 13.9% alcohol, with a big smack of oak in the nose. That oak is wrapped around green banana and green apple fruit, with a little vanilla on the side. As young as it is, it seems likely to knit together and improve over the next year or two.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"The blended wine from Two Paddocks is a crowd-pleaser in 2015, offering medium body, silky tannins and enjoyable notes of baking spices and red cherries. It's a fine introduction to the brand and the region, delicious now, yet capable of aging through at least 2020.",New Zealand-Central Otago-Pinot Noir
"Clumsy out of the starting blocks, with creamy chocolate aromas, leather and leafiness. The palate is solid and concentrated, but short on elegance and depth of flavor. What's here is blocky and chunky, but also sort of green and flaky. Decent but with some issues, and just good on its best day. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir

"Aromas of balsam wood, dry spice, berries and vanilla are attractive and inviting. It feels lush and deep, with good layering and robust flavors of berry fruit, spice, herb and tobacco.

"Co-owner Rachel Stellareese Davies first began making her own wine alongside the late Greg Brown of T-Vine, also in Calistoga.

The finish is dusted in chocolate.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This salmon-pink-colored wine is refreshingly fruity, with attractively crisp acid offsetting the bright red fruit and apple flavors. Drier than in past vintages, it still has a ripe, soft finish.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This is a rather big and burly wine for a Mosel spätlese, weighing in at 11.5% alcohol. And while it shows plenty of power, it also shows nuance in its aromas and flavors, which range from baked fruit, honey and spiced marmalade to oily, mineral essences. Has the concentration to age, but the balance of sugar and alcohol may not hold in the long run—drink it over the next few years to avoid disappointment.",Germany-Mosel-Saar-Ruwer-Riesling
"Kudos to winemakers Adam and Dianna Lee for managing to wrest a Syrah this likeable from the difficult 2011 vintage. It's almost worth aging, with a delicious core of molten blackberries, black currants and green tea, and significant tannins, the kind that lock the palate down. And the wine may in fact hold and develop a bit. But the fruit won't outlast the tannins much beyond 2017. Whenever you drink it, give it a few hours in the decanter.",US-California-Syrah
"High toned aromas of spice, herbs and sweet plum are followed by black currant and blackberry flavors. It brings undeniable appeal.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fairly big and full-bodied, but not overoaked or overripe, so you get true plum and red-berry flavors, some of Carmenère's herbal side, and a solid finish that offers good spice flavors and proper tannins. Sometimes simple is better, and this wine's no-nonsense approach is what works.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"Concannon's Reserve Petite swirls in plum, dark chocolate and coconut with densely layered tannins that are expertly contained. No puckering here.",US-California-Petite Sirah

"The Holstein designate offers pretty flavors of cherry and brambly berry, along with the Dr. Pepper character often found in Oregon. It's drinking well, though lacking the concentration that you would anticipate from the vintage and AVA.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Chock-a-block full of strawberry, black cherry and a sliver of orange peel, this wine is big-boned, well-structured and fleshy. Mouthfilling and juicy, the palate shows touches of black tea and tobacco, making for a lively tension between the earthiness and exuberance of fruit. Drink now through 2022.",US-California-Pinot Noir

The palate delivers rich flavors of juicy cherry, raspberry and black pepper along with supple tannins and fresh acidity. Made to be drunk young.",Italy-Southern Italy-Piedirosso
"Dense on the nose, with a mix of black fruit aromas and mild herbs. The palate is properly acidic and elevated, with complex flavors of coconut, plum, berry, mocha, chocolate and spice.

"Named after the officials of the French Court who were responsible for the King's cellar, this intense wine is a blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.

Well-oaked, it shows smoky flavors of blackberry marmalade, red and black currants and peppery spices, and has the texture of a fine Cabernet. Drink now through 2013.",US-California-Zinfandel

"Made in a more extracted, fuller style, this is overwhelmingly earthy and intensely aromatic. Its time in oak has not quite shaken off entirely, and its fruit expression veers on the darker side, with notes of black cherries and blueberries standing out the most. An herbal aura lingers around.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine is firm with solid tannins. It has rich fruit and concentration with layers of blackberry and dark plums. It comes from a small seven-acre property and is aged for 15 months in wood. This impressive wine needs to age, so drink from 2022.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

On the smooth palate, notes of chocolate, chopped mint and clove accent the black cherry core. Bright acidity and fine-grained tannins provide balance and structure.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"This wine, with its black color, barely escapes being too much. Initially, it seems too rich, too concentrated. But slowly its more elegant character, ripe and smooth, comes through. The acidity gives surprising freshness considering the weight and density. It does need time, so drink from 2017.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red

It's harmonious and balanced, with ample acidity lending good lift through the close. Drink now.",South Africa-Western Cape-Chardonnay

"The winery's top of the top, this is a viscous, concentrated expression of the grape, blended with 5% Merlot, the fruit from the producer's estate Sage Vineyard on Mount Veeder.

"This is a fully mature wine showcasing toast, ripe fruit and citrus acidity at their best. It is not a dry wine, with signs of a relatively high dosage, but that gives the wine softness as well as richness. Ready to drink now, but it will also keep until 2020.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Cherry, blackberry and baking-spice aromas are classic for this winery and the Rioja region. Bright, elegant and just plush enough on the palate, this tastes of plum, spiced berry fruits and mocha. A composed, dry, loamy feeling finish isn't pushy or demanding. Drink this easygoer through 2021.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"There's much to like in this wine's notes of cocoa and cherry, with the barrel spices bringing a sense of confection. The flavors are appealing but the tannins bring a slight feel of gruffness that holds it back.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This offers aromas of jasmine, hawthorn and ripe pear. The round palate delivers creamy green apple, white peach, tangerine zest and a note of honeyed almond accompanied by racy acidity and a foaming mousse.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Round, melony and pleasant, with tropical/floral aromas. Flavorwise, it's all about medium-intensity melon and lychee, and as Torrontés goes this one is likable and well made. It covers the tropical fruit bases and adds in some peppery dryness on the finish.",Argentina-Other-Torrontés

This is eminently drinkable with its wonderful backbone of acidity, its uncomplicated blueberry fruit and very appealing rusticity that makes you want to sip.",Austria-Burgenland-Blaufränkisch
"Made entirely from estate fruit, and given time to settle in French oak puncheons, only a third of them new, this dry and complex white is easily quaffable and yet so much more. Citrus peel and dried herb complement on the nose and palate, with a lightness of being that never veers on frivolous.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

"This bottling slips in many corners of the flavor experience at once. On the nose, a bit of tropical fruit mixes with evenly spread buttercream, followed by precursor hints of bright acidity on the palate. That citrus-led vibrancy does come, as does a mix of creaminess and limestone-inflected tang, as if the rocks themselves delivered the acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"On the nose, the ripe pear fruit notes are subdued but they play on the fresh palate with force. This wine is rounded and super-juicy. Drink soon to make most of all this fruit.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris

"This wine continues a long-standing tradition, showing a mastery of the art of blending. It's made using grapes that are sourced from at least six vineyards scattered from Yountville to St. Helena. Right out of the bottle, it's a soft, smoothly tannic wine that's rich in blackberry jam, black currant, blueberry, raspberry, dark chocolate and spice flavors. The wine, which contains small amounts of Petit Verdot and Malbec, is so powerful, it easily carries the 100% new French oak. Just gorgeous now, and it should develop bottle complexity for at least the next 10 years.",US-California-Red Blend

"A blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, the 2003 Rovaio is surprisingly light and delicate considering the hot vintage that shaped it.

"This bottling, which is both a reference to the Lynyrd Skynyrd song and an ode to the grape growers, offers vibrant blackberry, slate and vanilla aromas. The palate is ripe and juicy but balanced, with tangy plum skin and dark spice flavors, framed by a chalky tannic structure. It's fruity enough for traditional California Zinfandel fans but complex enough to win converts.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Dark and meaty on the nose, with plum, blackberry and spice notes. The palate is fleshy but a little hollow in the middle, with dark fruit that's tasty but not real deep or complicated.

"This rich, fruity Cabernet comes from one of the higher mountain regions in Dry Creek Valley. It's enormously concentrated in blackberry, black currant and oak flavors, with the briary, peppery note so often found in Dry Creek reds. Fairly tannic, it leaves a trail of astringency after you swallow. Good, if a little rustic. Give it three or four years to come around.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Gritty, medicinal, almost reduced aromas of blueberry are devoid of softness, while the palate is also kind of tight and tough. Seems more clipped and underdone than the 2005, with narrow tannins and a medicinal burn.

"This is a sweet wine with flavors of white sugar, orange, honey and vanilla, all brightened by crisp acidity.",US-California-Riesling

Creamy notes introduce an earthier dimension to this lemon-scented wine that has an equally lemon-focused core and a rather slender body. This is slight and cannot make up its mind whether it wants to be sharp or creamy—so it oscillates between these poles.,Austria-Kamptal-Riesling
"Though it starts with a burst of tropical yellow fruit and its accompanying sweetness, this is still a dry wine, with a strong mineral-and-citrus backbone. Finishes with more tropical fruit and some white pepper. Try it with Asian cuisine—this plus a ginger-based sauce makes for a good match.",Australia-South Australia-Riesling
"Intriguing aromas of white spring flower, ripe orchard fruit and a smoky whiff of gunflint lift out of the glass. The polished palate delivers juicy white peach, green apple, white almond a mineral note suggesting wet stone. It's a lovely wine.",Italy-Lombardy-Turbiana

"This is a pretty taut wine that combines a rich style with good, vibrant acidity. Yet it is described as 100% fermented in stainless steel rather than oak barrels. The aromas resemble toasted baguette, butter and toasted walnut, while the flavors are like ripe apple and almonds.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Intriguing aromas of graphite, damp campfire, roasted meat and dried black cherries make for a savory nose to this bottling from a vineyard in the Corralitos area. Roasted cherries and plums show on the palate, where interesting notes of tar, charcoal and pencil shavings arise. Vanilla and sandalwood show at the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"All varietal coming from Heart of the Hill Vineyard, this brooding wine offers aromas of dark coffee, cherry, bittersweet chocolate, clove and assorted barrel spices (80% new French). It's classically styled with reserved, almost elegant fruit flavors, bright acid and firm tannins that need time in the cellar to soften. Best after 2020.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon

"There is an earthy, animal element to this wine that adds complexity to ripe fruit flavors. Currently, it's a wine that is all potential, sweet and dense with a finish of intense acidity. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Sangiovese from the Castelnuovo Berardenga area of Chianti Classico benefits from slightly warmer temperatures on average. That extra heat shapes a full and generous quality of fruit that is ripe with blackberry, prune and plum. There's a touch of earthy clay and tobacco at the back.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This is a wine that's soft in structure, and while it's dry, it's hard in tannins and the fruit has a baked taste like shrivelled raisins. Not an ager.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A young, plummy Zin that's lightly sweet, with blackberry jam, vanilla and caramel notes.",US-California-Zinfandel

"This Bordeaux-style blend, made from 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Malbec, 16% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc, is a complex and layered wine.

"There's no escaping the asparagus and canned bean aromas that consume the bouquet, but those scents do fade after a while and the nose eventually leads to flavors of lime, white peach and citrus. The zest and balance are good, and the vegetal character becomes less austere with time; but all along the way the wine carries that love-it-or-hate-it snap of green.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc

"Extremely grassy on the nose, this also shows lime juice and a skunky cannabis character that starts to blow off with time. The texture is racy on the palate, but the grassy component proves rather sour and one-dimensional.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"From a certified biodynamic vineyard planted by Bob and Louisa Lindquist, this bottling offers vivid red cherry fruit, black pepper and tons of clove spice on the nose. The palate is soft with more red fruit, but loaded with ample amounts of star anise and other baking spices. Zesty on all fronts.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Given the difficulties of the 2010 vintage, this wine is a success. The tannins are young, thick and astringent, and then the acids kick in.

Easy to find, with 10,600 cases produced.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Distinctive and generous, this white Rhône-style wine is made from Sierra Foothills grapes by a seasoned Napa winemaker. It tastes like vanilla, hazelnuts and pears, has a creamy texture, feels layered with fruit and spice notes, and has good acidity balanced by richness of flavor.",US-California-White Blend
"The small production of this wine just fitted into four barrels, two of which were new. It's a ripe wine, complex, concentrated and showing the quality of this famous vineyard. High-density planting and 40-year-old vines all contribute to the wine's structure. Drink from 2018.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Honoring the 40th vintage for these vines, planted at Tualatin Estate in 1973, this elegant and subtle wine shows pinpoint varietal character. It charms immediately with scents of dusty baking spices and cherry pie. Flavors follow into a graceful and proportionate finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This smoky wine has firm tannins and a tough core. The juicy fruit is taking its time to develop, although it will give the wine density and ripe berries in time. The vineyard, created in the early 1980s is now at peak maturity. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine is flavorful and sturdy. Full bodied enough to accompany rich dishes, it's affordable, too. It has butter and caramel aromas, an almost thick, syrupy texture and firm tannins. Moderate cherry flavors accompany the oaky components.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Citrus and herb aromas set the mouth watering, anticipating a crisp, bracing wine. But this one's surprisingly soft in the mouth, filling out with tropical fruit flavors that could use a bit more zest.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"The bouquet offers intensely jammy prune and black-currant fruit, with tobacco and vanilla shadings making an appearance. Dark blueberry flavors, with some mint and a light orange-citrus note. Full grapey mouthfeel, a long finish, and dusty tannins. Almost drinkable now, but best after 2002 and until 2010.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Peach and melon aromas are inviting and clean. Very juicy and juice-like in the mouth, probably more so than I can remember for this wine. It tastes like orange, tangerine and grapefuit juices mixed together. The texture isn't very smooth or wine-like; seems less refined and less minerally than in the past.",Spain-Northern Spain-Godello
"Aromas of apple, crushed stone and thyme come together on this vibrant white. The medium-bodied palate offers green pear, juicy nectarine, dried herb and flinty mineral alongside lively acidity. A note of bitter almond fills in the finish.",Italy-Central Italy-White Blend
"Aged in American oak, this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot offers a straightforward enjoyment of blackberry, tar and tobacco leaf with a side of bacon. Thick and bittersweet in tannin, it's an affordable red that will please many palates.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This still has a touch of flinty reduction. Clean and fresh, the palate does not yet show much fruit. This seems stony and tight, with occasional glimpses of spice. The wine needs some air to open up but presents taut, clean refreshment.",Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
"This easy opens with good structure, a silky mouthfeel and abundant aromas of stone fruit and citrus.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Aromas of blackberry jam, candied cherry, cake spice and graphite waft out of the glass. The thick palate delivers spicy plum, crushed black cherry, chocolate, clove and mint alongside velvety tannins. It's not very complex but it's seductively smooth and delicious.",Italy-Southern Italy-Primitivo
"A smoky aroma of plum-sauce-coated beef roast wafts on the nose of this lush bottling, which also offers white pepper and lilac. Plump berries and a fine-grained tannic structure consume the palate, finishing on a light caramel note.",US-California-Malbec
"A touch of lemon appears on the nose. The palate is light and frothy, with easy freshness and lively citrus and apple fruit. The finish is dry. Drink soon.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"A lovely Chardonnay to drink tonight, this one, from the winery's fine Carneros vineyard on the Napa side, shows bright, mineral-infused pineapple, lime and spicy clove and pepper flavors. The acidity will balance a rich dish, such as seared scallops in a coconut-curry sauce.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A blend of young vines fruit gives a very soft, gently rounded wine with only the lightest of depth. The fruit is full, the flavors show some spice, while yellow fruit tastes roll around underneath. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Château Grenouilles is a parcel within the Grenouilles Grand Cru, a monopoly of the La Chablisienne cooperative. The wine is always impressive. It has weight, richness, concentration and considerable potential. Yellow fruits, wood-aging, spice and a firm structure indicate keeping this wine for six years.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Rooty, herbal berry aromas are forward and scratchy. This has a narrow, condensed, acidic feel and herbal, spicy, lightly green plum and currant flavors. A minty, peppery, dry finish is choppy and tannic, but it's also well focused.",Chile-Maule Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Very dry, tannic and full-bodied, with somewhat underripe tobacco, pepper and herb flavors behind the blackberries. More like a minor Zinfandel than a Syrah. The toughness and grittiness need softening meats and cheeses for balance.",US-California-Syrah
"Delicate scents of beeswax and white spring flower lift out of the glass. The round, juicy palate offers mature pear, white almond and a hint of citrus alongside soft acidity.",Italy-Piedmont-Arneis
"Perhaps a little overripe on the nose, this late harvest is high-toned and rather sharp in its attack. Concentrated peach, apricot, butter brickle and honey flavors carry the midpalate, but the finish turns bitter.",Canada-Ontario-Riesling
"With its white fruit, lively acidity and delicious ripeness, this is very ready to drink. It's an opulent, rounded wine, with hints of spice to go with its fruit character.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"It opens up to reveal layers of scents including tilled earth, underbrush, black berries, balsamic notes and baking spices. Juicy red cherry, black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and cocoa flavors flow along the vibrant palate supported by a backbone of lively acidity and solid tannins. Drink after 2020.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This is light and bright, with crisp acidity and the fruitiness of an attractive, early-drinking wine.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"From a single vineyard in Estremoz, this structured and dense wine houses notes of bitter chocolate and tart berry. It's full of tannins and needs time to soften. Drink from 2016.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Aromas of stewed plum, leather, truffle and dark spice lead the nose. The full-bodied palate offers dried cherry, orange zest and a hint of licorice alongside assertive tannins that leave a firm finish. Give the tannins another year or two to unwind a little then drink to capture the remaining fruit.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This lightly aromatic wine offers notes of butterscotch, peach and toasty spices. It's lighter in style with a creamy feel to the stone and tropical fruit flavors.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Bold and dark, this brawny wine shows beautifully evolved aromas of cured meat, leather, tar, cola and resin backed by candied fruit, pomegranate and crème de cassis. That extra muscle helps support the sharpness of the acidity, and plays a promising role in the wine's overall aging potential. Hold 5–10 years.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Aromas of ripe plum, roasted coffee bean and espresso come together in the glass. A blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot, the firm palate offers dried black cherry, espresso, toasted oak and grilled herb alongside assertive but fine-grained tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"Soft, dainty scents of pressed sweet pea, white raspberry and cherry dance in the bouquet, while pithy citrus and cherry-skin flavors unfold on the palate. The midpalate shows a touch of roundness, but brisk acidity and a slight bitterness lifts the close. Drink now.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rosé
"This austere and lightly herbal Cabernet is balanced and varietal, but at first seems a bit dull, as if tasted through a screen. That said, it actually improved after 24 hours, with more presence to the tart red and black fruits. It's an elegant style that will probably show best with food.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Full bodied, dry and warmly fruity, this ripe-tasting and lush-textured wine has just enough tannin to add a little grip to each sip.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is soft and rounded with attractive red-cherry fruits, ripe strawberries and touches of wood and tannin. Acidity comes along behind this richness. It is going to develop quickly and will give great pleasure. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Pitch-black wine, very dense. It is spicy with concentrated black fruits, layered with equally intense acidity. Wood, fruit and sweet berries are all there. Tannins surround this firm wine, promising aging over 5–6 years.",Portugal-Dão-Portuguese Red
"I love the briary, spicy aroma on this wine. It's so inviting. But then when you taste it, it turns too soft and sweet, like a melted cherry- and cassis-filled chocolate truffle. That's a delicious flavor, but it's not really a dry table wine.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Sirmian is a beautiful Pinot Bianco that really shows true varietal characteristics. The subdued bouquet delivers pear, stone fruit and crushed mineral. The mouthfeel is creamy, rich and ends with waxy flavors of lemon and Golden Delicious apple.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Bianco
"Winemaker Spencer Daley taps a long respected vineyard to craft a solid Syrah that shows lavender, boysenberry, white pepper and dried fennel on the nose. There is a tarry quality to the palate, with black peppercorn, violet and charred beef notes accenting the underlying elderberry fruit. A solid structure ensures ageability.",US-California-Syrah
"Clean, fresh and simple, this does not claim to be “unoaked” but it carries that style in its flavors, a snappy mix of green apple, pineapple and grapefruit. Good everyday drinking.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Rough conflicted aromas of horseradish, beets and horse hide lead to a hard grabby palate that feels sticky and tannic. The heavy oak blends with stewed herbal black-fruit flavors before a scratchy tannic finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A broad wine, its ripe flavors fashioned with yellow fruits, toast, vanilla and an opulent texture. This is rich, open and packed with full-in-the-mouth flavors. Ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Riper aspects of Mirabelle plum join the aromatic spectrum dominated by bracing citrus zest. Grapefruit and lemon echo along the palate and surpass themselves in a tight, bracing and concentrated finish. Slender but ultratoned.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"From an estate vineyard, this is an impressive wine, fruity in plum and cherry with a plush juiciness and firm tannin structure. With aromas of baked bread along the way, it finishes as old vines should, full of leather and black pepper.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Crushed flower, wet earth and ripe berry aromas waft out of the glass. The palate offers black cherry, black pepper and espresso alongside soft tannins. It's straightforward and made to be enjoyed young. Drink through 2015.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Great price for a Cabernet this nice. It's dry, smooth and classic in blackberry and currant flavors, with a deft touch of smoky oak. Just a bit too acidic; a rich steak will help.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A pretty, fruity, forward Viognier, with appealing orange blossom, citrus and light tropical fruit. Nicely balanced, with just the right amount of acidity, a full midpalate and excellent concentration through the finish.",US-Oregon-Viognier
"Veteran winemaker Joel Aiken marches to a different beat from today's cult style, reverting to an older expression of Napa Valley Cabernet. This one is bone dry, tannic and tightly wound in acids. It will not offer much pleasure now, even after decanting. It needs to be aged, and judging by the intense core of blackberries, cherries and minerals, it will easily negotiate the next 10–15 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Tropical smelling, with green banana, minerality and firmness to the bouquet. The palate is clean and cleansing, which are two very different things, while the wine tastes of tangy citrus and green melon. Fresh, tropical and uncomplicated. Drink this year.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"This 70-30 blend of Cabernet and Sangiovese features aromas of cherry, toast, maple syrup, ink and spice. The wine boast thick, seemingly impenetrable extraction and a dense, chewy mouthfeel.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"The mineral structure gives this wine an initially austere character. There is a balance between acidity and textured black-plum skin and berry fruit flavors. There are also firm, dry tannins that need to soften. Drink from 2017.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This ripe, fruity wine has soft tannins and red-berry flavors. With just a touch of spice, it is ready to drink.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Big and rich, this is packed with complex flavors of soft cherry jam, roasted meat, white pepper and sweet, smoky new oak. There's a note of overripeness in the finish, like dried prunes. Drink it now with rich, fatty meats and sauces.",US-California-Syrah-Grenache
"A nice Cabernet for drinking now. It's rich in berries, cherries, currants and oak, with smooth tannins and soft acidity. Shows an elaboration that makes it upscale and elegant.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Hot, rubbery and burning on the nose, and then clampy in the mouth, with compact, highly generic flavors of red cherry and plum. The heat and burn that's present up front re-emerges on the finish, where jackhammer tannins hold court.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Herbal aromas infiltrate the nose, and the palate features midlevel red fruit with a strong herbal edge. The finish shows saline, chocolate and pepper, and never does it rise much above struggling.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made with 100% Sangiovese, this stunning but reserved wine opens with multifaceted aromas of underbrush, violet, black berries and just a whiff of leather. The delicious, structured palate delivers vibrant black cherry and ripe raspberry alongside notes of black pepper and grilled rosemary. It's impeccably balanced by fresh acidity and a tannic backbone. It's still young so give this time to fully develop. Drink 2016–2022.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Ripe and fleshy, this wine is firm and dry, but has extra-ripe fruit. Perhaps the fruit is too rich, leaving the wine unbalanced. In the future, it will show fewer tannins and more fruit. Corinne and Charles-Henri Gonet of the Gonet Champagne family bought Bacalan with the intent of restructuring the vineyards, some of which had not been planted for 70 years. The first red vintage was 2001; first white vintage was 2014.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Basket-pressed and aged for 10 months in 20% new oak, this estate-grown Pinot Noir has lovely berry and cherry scents and flavors. It's spicy, varietal, and brambly, with a medium-deep palate and accents of dried herbs.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Honeysuckle and stone fruit aromas take center stage on this breezy white. The lively palate accents unripe peach, crisp green apple and a hint of bitter almond alongside racy acidity.",Italy-Central Italy-Verdicchio
"Light in color, this rejoices in its perfumed character as much as its fruit. There is a heady smoky aroma, while the palate shows a leaner character. The fruit flavors of red berries are given an extra dimension by the smoky wood and the meaty edge.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Sweet aromas of white peach entice one into this lively wine, a profile that carries through to the delicate palate. A refreshing apéritif that finishes dry, the wine is light in alcohol and body.",US-California-Moscato
"With a mix of graham cracker, coffee, herb and jammy, unfocused berry aromas, this lacks cohesion on the nose. A fat, wide palate offers no point of focus, while herbal flavors of cassis and olive finish with green notes of tobacco and oregano.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"On the light, fresh and fruity side of aged tawnies, this is ripe and has good acidity. Signs of wood aging are well mannered, not too obtrusive. Fresh and smoothly textured, it is delicious.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Soft and somewhat vegetal, with asparagus-infused flavors of blackberries and cherries that finish dry and tannic.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's no oak on this Chardonnay, but you won't miss it at all. It's so decadent in long hangtime pineapple, tangerine, mango and spice flavors, superripe and just delicious. The alcohol is fairly high, but that's the price of all this richness.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The nose on this wine from veteran vintner Eric Ogorsolka is reminiscent of an old-time closet, with pipe smoke, cedar and plum perfume. It's quite woody and elegant on the palate, with well-integrated fruit, spice and herb characters suggesting savory plum jelly and prune reduction sauce.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Aromas of butter, vanilla, corn silk and tropical fruit lead to barrel-forward, oak-laden pineapple flavors that intertwine through the finish. For the style, it's well done but the oak is pretty intense.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Puckery lime and lemon flavors collide into lavish streaks of honey and marmalade in this penetrating, lip-smacking kabinett. Delicately composed with the faintest hint of sweetness, it reverberates through a high-toned, tangerine finish. Drink now through 2018.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"This red combines Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon to create black currant and Mediterranean herb aromas. The easygoing, approachable palate shows black cherry and dark spice flavors, framed by polished tannins. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Give this a few more years of cellar aging to better integrate the oak spice and toast elements that appear on the bouquet. Nebbiolo's legendary aging potential shines through with tight tannins, bright acidity and a beautiful medley of balsamic and herb aromas.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A firm, ripe wine, with good sweet black currant fruit flavors. It is structured, but mainly showing fruit rather than tannins. There is a fine, fresh finish, hinting at wood.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A mix of unidentified red varieties, this wine opens slowly, without much in the way of aromatics. Weedy sage, tobacco and a grip of tannin give it weight and richness alongside its full body, as a bramble of blackberry and currant weave within.",US-California-Red Blend
"This is a very big Zinfandel, exuberant and lush in fruit. It floods the palate with blackberries, cherries, mulberries, plums and currants, complexed with smoky oak and spices. Fine now with steak fajitas or a juicy cheeseburger.",US-California-Zinfandel
"There's a slight reductive quality to the nose of this otherwise fresh, medium-bodied white that's decently concentrated in a brightness of lemon and apple. With integrated oak and texture, it's a nice choice for the table or by the glass as an apéritif.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Lavish streaks of butter, vanilla and baking spice fatten this opulent Chardonnay. It's unabashedly oaky in style but fresh lemon acidity lends elegance to the midpalate. Finishes briskly.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"This blend of best barrels from Terravant shows rhubarb, turned earth, chaparral funk and black cherry at the deepest core of the nose. The mouthfeel is broad and welcoming, with steady flavors of blackberry, olallieberry, licorice and a touch of citrus tartness.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"You'll find a silky elegance in this robust blend of Syrah, Petit Verdot and Malbec. The palate is robust with flavors of raspberry, cola, persimmon and baking spice, along with big, brawny tannins.",US-California-Red Blend
"An extremely dense nose reveals espresso bean, blackberry paste, caramelized berries, black pepper and a hint of tobacco, reminiscent of a fruit-laced, heavily spiced crème brûlée. The blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Franc and 5% Syrah is silky on the palate with oregano, dill and fennel giving nuance to dried blueberry fruit, laid across a powerful structure. Drink 2016–2027.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Faint red apple and lemon scents show on the nose of this wine. Its soft, easy palate, enlivened with slight spritz, shows the same appetizing, freshly-cut red apple fruit. Light-bodied, charming, easy and fresh.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Zweigelt
"Made with Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera, this informal red opens with aromas of blue flower and wild berry. The simple palate offers juicy blackberry and Morello cherry alongside soft, fleeting tannins. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy soon.",Italy-Southern Italy-Red Blend
"This offers a base of bright cherry flavor, followed by light tobacco and spice tones. Pair this with grilled lamb chops or roasted pork rolls.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Concentrated blackberry, currant and vanilla flavors ride a boldly ripe, full-bodied palate that reflects the warmth and intensity of the vintage. Dusty tannin and softened oak allow the fruit to speak, accented by black licorice.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"92-94 Barrel sample. The wine feels very soft, with sweet spice and light tannins. It is packed with blackberry fruits, although there is a sold, firm structure under the ripe fruit.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Starts out a bit flat, with milk chocolate and raisiny aromas. With airing it evolves and expands, showing snappy flavors of berry, raisin and brown sugar. Very solid on the finish and elegant as an aged Rioja gran reserva should be. Drink now through 2015.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Made from 85% Grenache and 15% Syrah, both from Kick Ranch Vineyard, this salmon-colored quaffer was fermented in concrete, and is hard to describe aromatically, taking its time to open. Dry, it tastes of watermelon and a hint of clove-like spice, remaining fresh on the palate and lightweight.",US-California-Rosé
"One of the best Cabernet Francs out there, this shows the imposing structure of a Cabernet Sauvignon, although it's lighter in body, with rich, dense tannins, fine acids and flavors of cherries and red currants. Decant it, and drink now with steak.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"This intensely crisp selection shows its red-currant-driven acidity immediately. It is a fragrant, refreshing wine, very food-oriented with its dry character. It has touch of toast and a taut, minerally finish.",France-Champagne-Pinot Noir
"Loaded with honey, marzipan, peach and exotic fruit, this special expression of Moscato d'Asti delivers a thick, creamy feel in the mouth with foamy mousse and soapy intensity. Pair this with sugary almond cookies.",Italy-Piedmont-Moscato
"This gorgeous wine opens with scents of ripe, dark-skinned berry, cake spice, star anise and a balsamic note. The delicious palate tastes of layers of juicy raspberry, black cherry, licorice and a hint of tobacco framed in firm refined tannins. It already shows impressive depth but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2018–2030.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"It seems as if the emphasis is more on the oak than on the fruit. But the oak is darn tasty—toasty, vanillin and bringing all sorts of dried-spice complexities to the table. The wine is creamy and full enough to support the oak, even if the cherry-berry flavors do take a back seat. —J.C.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (67%), Merlot (26%) and Cabernet Franc. It's aromatically expressive, with notes of raspberry, cigar box, mint, café au lait, blackberry, dried herb, anise and wet gravel. The palate displays a sense of elegance and refinement that captures the attention, with red-fruit flavors lingering on the long (slightly warm) finish.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Here's a rich, oak-aged blend of Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Ribolla Gialla and Friuliano that shows the aromatic characteristics of Sauvignon backed by the creamy texture of Chardonnay and Ribolla Gialla. This is a thick, ripe wine that lends a touch of melon sweetness in the mouth.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend
"Lots of acidity in this wine. It cuts right through the middle, giving the cherry fruit a sour candy tartness. Not one for the cellar, so drink it now with a rich steak, which will balance out the acids and tannins.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This well-made wine in a rich style smells like ripe pears and melted butter, and tastes soft and almost sweet, resembling pear and peach juice. The texture is smooth and soft and the body is medium, so it's easy to enjoy.",US-California-Chardonnay
". This excellent wine, which is made from the five classic Bordeaux varieties, shows the briary, tannic quality of Dry Creek Valley red wines. It's a lusty, complex sipper with quite a lot of character and personality, and should provide good drinking over the next six years or so.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fiesta is the lightest, most fruit forward of the four different Tempranillos from Abacela. In a great year such as this, it's also substantial and authoritative, with deeply driven flavors of red and blueberry fruit, a whiff of oak and slightly grainy tannins. This wine clearly over-delivers for the price.",US-Oregon-Tempranillo
"This has a warm, rounded character, with pressing minerality. Notes of apple, pear and a touch of vanilla all add richness and an open character. It has warm, rich fruit on the finish.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Ripe, heady aromas of toasty, creamy oak along with prune, raisin and cedar might be too much for those who are oak averse. Like the nose, the palate is woody and creamy, but also thick and somewhat flabby. Flavors of coconut, mocha, baking spices and blackberry finish woody and with chewy tannins.",Spain-Northern Spain-Mencía
"Dark tannins provide the structured for the Cabernet Sauvignon black currant flavors. It has power—this is a big and solid wine, given tension by tannins, that will take several years to soften out.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Sweetly extracted fruit and oak star in this rich Pinot Noir. It has flavors of raspberry jam, cherry pop tart, vanilla, buttered toast, brown sugar and cinnamon. All this richness is balanced by brisk, mouthwatering acidity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Opulent tropical fruit and florals perfume this decadently ripe yet bracing wine. It's intensely fruity and juicy yet spine tingling with acidity. Blossom and honey notes leave a lingering, pleasantly viscous trail of sweetness on the palate. Delightful now but likely to hold through 2022.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Tempranillo is carving out an important role for itself in southern Oregon. This young wine has a strong mineral streak around flavors of wild berry, citrus oil, and chalk. A light and lovely tobacco scent adds interest.",US-Oregon-Tempranillo
"Succulent in white peach, pear and apple, this is a nicely balanced, pretty wine. It offers just the right amount of richness on the palate, with a swirl of vanilla caramel suggested in the background amid an intriguingly unexpected salty, pretzel-like finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Structured in young tannins, this wine has a nice mélange of leather, blackberry, clove and black tea that provide substance and flavor, with additional savory specks of graphite. Light bodied and soft, the acidity behind the fruit suggests further aging, through 2020.",US-California-Merlot
"Lightly vegetal aromas of asparagus and canned beans are intermixed with generic citrus scents. This wine is more acid than anything, with angularity to the palate. Salty, tart, citric flavors finish racy and with a lingering note of sour orange.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Sauvignon Blanc
"Clean and crisp, the main aromas and flavors are green apples and spice. A forward, consumer-friendly, simple Chardonnay.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Sweet red cherry, strawberry and smoky charred oak figure most prominently in this robust, full-bodied wine, which opens in a yeasty, baked bread note, and which comes across as somewhat undeveloped.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Dark gold in color, this Port relishes its age. Like an aged tawny, it has lost its fruit at this mature stage, while gaining the rich, intense character that comes from long wood aging. It has concentrated acidity and a long, lingering aftertaste. Drink now.",Portugal-Port-Port

"Cabernet Sauvignon (73%) makes up the majority of this blend, with the balance Syrah (15%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of barrel spice, baking spice, dark fruit and herb are followed by luxurious black-fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It shows a bit of heat but otherwise delivers.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This is a bright, expressive Albariño with fresh apple and peach aromas. A zesty palate brings some spritz, which is normal for a wine that macerates in whole clusters. Flavors of honeydew, apple and lime finish with minerally tightness.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"One whiff tells you this bubbly is in a league of its own. It’s not the toast or the lees, not the lime-scented fruit or the doughy notes; it’s something indefinable, but complex and refined. That pedigree carries through in the mouth, where the fruit is modulated. The impression is of acidity and elegance, although the fruit shows up in the finish. Terrific now, but has the balance and harmony to last for a lot longer.",US-California-Champagne Blend
"This is an elegant, heady Chardonnay beaming in floral jasmine aromas, honey and oak. Bright on the palate, it offers lively acidity and an abundance of pineapple and mango, tropical in all the right ways.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The wine comes from a large 300 acre vineyard in the eastern Costa Serena region. Dominated by Niellucciu (aka Sangiovese), it brings out all the acidity of the grape, restrained by ripe raspberry and apple fruitiness. It is a light, bright and crisp wine.",France-France Other-Rosé
"Crisp and fresh, this is a tangy, lemon and orange zest flavored wine. Lively acidity bursts through the richer white fruits, green plums and quince spiciness. Both fresh and ripe, it's well balanced. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Wonderful richness, depth and concentration make this full-bodied wine a standout. Rich berry and cherry flavors are densely packed within a velvety viscous texture that soothes the palate and clings to the sides of the mouth. A long finish completes the picture.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Bold and rich without feeling heavy, this luscious wine oozes with ripe blackberry and boysenberry fruit and has a mouth-coating, mouth-filling texture that keeps its flavors echoing through the finish. Occasio makes exceptional wines in small quantities.",US-California-Zinfandel
"With a vegetal note, some cocoa and berry on the nose and its simple, rather flat flavor profile, this Cabernet suffers from both vintage deficiencies and over-oaking. Dry and woody on the back end.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Just beautiful, a crisp wine of authoritative structure that brilliantly shows off the ripeness of its fruit. Waves of Meyer lemon purée, Key lime pie, white peach, tangerine and spice flavors wash over the palate and last for a long, rich finish. Drink this bone-dry wine now.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"90-92 Barrel sample. Tight tannins set the scene for a wine that is firm, but with delicious blackcurrant fruit flavors. The tannins are dry under this freshness. Very vivid aftertaste.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Fresh, clean aromas of lime chiffon, just-sliced nectarine, light jasmine and honeysuckle greet the nose on this bottling from the longtime producer. Limestone and chalky minerality mark the palate, with slightly sour green pear peels and more white flowers.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This spicy, powerful Zinfandel has 10% of Petite Sirah blended in, which adds depth, richness and tannins. You can call the resulting wine rustic, in the sense of its wild berry and spice flavors and briary, brambly mouthfeel. But it's also classic Dry Creek Valley.

"Golden yellow, with notes of fig, apricot and mint. At 23% residual sugar, it's rich and sweet, but the concentration drops off on the back half.",US-Idaho-Riesling
"This Cabernet remains tough in tannins and a little harsh in acidity. The blackberry, roasted meat, pepper and toast flavors are rich and complex.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A wine with great weight, density and structure from a well-positioned parcel of vines. The juicy plum flavors affirm the potential for opulence as the wine ages.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This is a smoothly crafted, delicate blend of 61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc. Its ethereal nature does not preclude plenty of quiet power, which provides a sturdy foundation for the bright cassis and raspberry flavor. Subtle spice box, cedar and cigar add to its complexity and length.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A rugged red, harsh in texture and semi-sweet, with medicinal cherry flavors.",US-California-Red Blend
"Australian winemaker John Duval is the winemaker for Long Shadows' signature Syrah. His experience shows in the Oz-like color (almost black), the spicy berry, plum, cherry and currant fruit, and the silky, polished tannins. Interestingly, Duval uses a splash of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, rather than going with Viognier. The wine seems to be holding something back; it's definitely got some years ahead.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Oak, toast, butter, nectarine, vanilla and butterscotch sensations take center stage in this high-octane Chardonnay from Friuli. The palate is dominated by scorching alcohol that throws the wine out of balance.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Chardonnay
"Still showing its tannins, this wine is developing well. It is relatively light in texture, the sweet berry fruits balanced with a layer of acidity.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Softly fruity wine, with a touch of toast, ripe pear and melon flavors. The wine is warm, approachable, fruity, ready to drink.",France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc

"Weighty and creamy in rich tones of just-picked pineapple and Key lime, this is round and expansive on the palate, with undertones of earth and herb. Complex layers of apple and almond interplay, before a finish of honey and spice lingers.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A ripe specimen with baked, earthy aromas that settle with airing. Hits with power and layering along with medicinal, oaky flavors that foist chocolate onto the wine's core black-fruit content. Generous despite some ruggedness and heat to the finish. Malbec with Cab Franc, Cab Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A bit brittle, with big acidity and a tension of green fruit and cherries. Oak certainly helps, providing smoky vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast richness, but the stemmy flavors don't go away.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine starts out a bit reduced before it opens to display aromas of kiwi, pineapple and pink grapefruit. The flavors drink dry and seem quite dilute.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is the sort of Shiraz that forces tasters to re-examine their view of the variety as produced in Australia. It starts off with powerful aromas of cracked pepper and floral notes evocative of violets, then delivers explosively spicy flavors of pepper and licorice cushioned by ripe blackberries and a rich, supple texture. It's the best of New and Old Worlds. Drink 2010–2020 plus. Imported by USA Wine West.",Australia-Western Australia-Shiraz
"A brilliant shade of pink, this bottling shows all the classic rosé aromas, from watermelon, to strawberry to bubblegum, with a touch of warm pastry as well. The palate offers a candied watermelon and cotton candy flavors, without any sweetness.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A good value, this starts off a little shaky thanks to some barnyard scents on the nose, then rights itself. Herbal-tobacco notes accent plum-prune flavors in this medium-bodied wine with a creamy-smooth texture. Soft and easygoing, it's ideal to drink now.",Australia-Western Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Very light in the glass, this bottling shows tons of underripe cranberry, dried rose petals, marjoram, white pepper and tangy olives on the nose. The light-bodied palate shows similar qualities, with fully extracted flavors of tart red fruits, purple flowers and white tea.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Hot, baked, rubbery aromas of black cherry and blackberry feed into a racy, pinched palate with astringent tannins. Herbal plum and berry flavors finish spicy and oaky, with a note of brown sugar. Drink through 2018.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
Gritty aromas suggest burnt popcorn and match stick. This is a round oily style of Torrontés with briny tropical fruit flavors. A salty note of persimmon carries an O.K. finish.,Argentina-Other-Torrontés
"There's not much going on here beyond lots of smoky, caramelized oak and some easy peach and citrus flavors. A touch of unripeness is also found. Chardonnnay has not been ZD's strong suit, and still isn't.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Aromas of red berry, mint, menthol and baking spice slowly take shape in the glass. On the palate, notes of anise, chopped herb and black pepper add depth to the cherry-raspberry core. Firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework. Drink 2018–2024.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
Bright red fruit highlights this soft wine. Acidity and hint of stalky tannins give its red berry flavors a boost. It's easygoing and ready to drink.,France-France Other-Malbec
"Shows the lush richness, dryness and complexity you want in a fine Napa Valley Cabernet. At more than six years of age, the tannins are just beginning to resolve, although they're still pretty fierce. But the flavors are beautiful, showing classic blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, plums and cedar. Drink now–2015.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a jammy Syrah with earthy, saucy black-fruit scents and a sense of reduction. Round and smooth for the most part, this registers as soft in feel. Flavors of blackened spice, blackberry and chocolate finish with coffee and mocha notes, while moderate acidity means the finish is short.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Syrah
"Blended from Petite Sirah, Syrah and Barbera, this is a hearty red wine that's tannic and jammy, with a honeyed finish. It's fine with burgers.",US-California-Red Blend
"Almost luscious pear aromas and notes of peardrop make for a very fruity nose. The palate has a fruity, lemony ease, while the body is slender, dry and has some spritz. The lemon freshness is vivid, brightening everything on this easy, fruity summer wine.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"Powerful and dense, this shows structured, ripe and concentrated black plum and dark cherry flavors. It has dense, firm tannins, which look likely to dominate the wine for many years, leaving a strong, dry aftertaste.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This is a simple but appealing rosé, defined by strawberry fruit, hints of chalk dust and a mouthwatering finish.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"White blossoms and summer peaches persist from nose to finish here. The palate is lusciously sweet, dripping with ripe, rich apricot and tangerine flavors, but a backdrop of lime acidity makes it refreshing too. Drink now through 2021.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Initially, the red fruits dominate, exploding in the mouth. Then the tannins take over, giving a wine that is hugely structured and powerful. The fruits, though, are as impressive as the tannins, the combination giving a wine that is both juicy and smoky, finished with new wood.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
The wine comes from what many consider to be the Grand Cru of Nuits Saint-Georges. It is firm and structured with solid tannins over black-cherry fruits. There is a tight streak of acidity that cuts through the wine giving a crisp center to the fine fruit. Drink this wine from 2019.,France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Ermacora's wines consistently show a smooth, silky quality. You'll recognize that house style here too thanks to this Friulano's creamy texture and pretty aromas of peach cobbler and pear.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Friulano
"There's no mistaking the variety here, with its attention-getting aromas of flowers, mandarin orange and ripe peach, along with lime-zest accents. It drinks off dry, with a plentiful, rich, flavorful palate. There's loads of enjoyment to be had.",US-Idaho-Riesling
"Fresh, cool, crisp and packed tight with aromas of citrus, exotic fruit and fragrant flowers, this is a wonderful Sauvignon from northeast Italy. Pair it with leek quiche or lightly fried zucchini flowers to maximize the wine's natural acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"Gentle friendly notes of yellow mirabelle plum play on the nose. The palate is equally fruity and appetizing, chock-full of fruit and freshness. Drink soon.",France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"This is a good bottle, single vineyard-sourced, toasty and still tightly-wound with tart red fruits. It's pretty and forward, perhaps best enjoyed in the next year or two.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Red chewy fruit that's succulent and satisfying defines this wine that takes a straightforward approach to oak and tannin, integrating them both well. Cherry and cassis linger on the sizable finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A pretty, expressive nose of fresh flowers, citrus and kiwi gives this Assyrtico added appeal. On the palate, slightly sweet tropical fruit and flowers will appeal to fans of a less bracing style of white. Pair with poultry, fruit.",Greece-Santorini-Assyrtico
"95   Massolino 2012 Parafada (Barolo). A textbook Barolo, this opens with scents of mature berry, leather, underbrush, tobacco and an elegant trace of fragrant blue flower. The well-structured palate delivers succulent black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, licorice, clove and mineral alongside a backbone of firm yet refined tannins. Drink 2020–2030.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This delicious wine from old Sémillon vines offers a hint of nuts and spice as well as crisp, clean fruit. It is lively with acidity as well as having a richer side. The wine will be just right from the end of 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Made from 75% Chardonnay and 25% Pinot Noir, with detectable residual sugar, this wine is moderately complex in its mix of peach, cherry and citrus flavor. The acidity is simple and direct. The palate is thick and creamy.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"This is a classic interpretation of Chianti Classico with bright aromas of small berry fruit, raspberry and blue flower. But there's also a modern touch as well that comes off aromatically as spice and new leather.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Showing a huge improvement over the '06, Novy's '07 Grenache is rich in chocolaty blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit, but beautifully structured. The firm tannins and crisp acids balance out the slightly sweet jammy flavors and lead to true elegance.",US-California-Grenache
"This is sort of a second wine of the respected veteran winemaker, Nick Goldschmidt, who bottles his more expensive brand under his last name. But there's nothing second-rate about the wine. It's classic Alexander Valley, soft and a little herbal, and rich in cherry, red currant, licorice, sweet vanilla oak and peppery spice flavors. Lovely now, and with the integrity to evolve for a decade.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a vineyard selection from the winery's estate, and it's a nicely drinkable Sauvignon Blanc, showing how well the variety does in Lake County. Fresh and juicy, the pineapple and fig flavors finish with a honeyed richness.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Bright and tonic, with vibrant fruit tones of cassis and dried raspberry followed by exotic spice and smoked bacon, this is an elegant and complex Barolo. After a while in the glass, you'll notice those fine mineral tones that characterize the Cannubi cru and that give this wine both backbone and personality.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Waxy, yeasty aromas are not very fresh. A citric mouthfeel lacks clarity and foundation, while orange and nectarine flavors are briny. This tastes pickled on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Viura
"Rich aromas of black cherry, anise seeds and buttered violets greet the nose on this dense bottling of a grape that rarely gets solo treatment. The palate is tarry and grippy, with dried sour cherries, boysenberry, black pepper and tightly grained cedar flavors that approach pine sap.",US-California-Petit Verdot
"A pleasant Cabernet, soft and fruity, with pretty blackberry, cherry and cola flavors, and a kiss of sweet oak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is tight and tannic, firm and missing fruit. It seems to have been heavily extracted, giving a bitter character to the wine. It could soften, although that is difficult to imagine.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Accented by 8% Zinfandel and 2% Syrah, this is big in robust, juicy black cherry and oak, the tannins correspondingly dusty and sizable. On the soft finish, a cup of drip black coffee suggests itself.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"From the winery's Annapolis Vineyard, at the cool, northern tip of the “true” Sonoma Coast, comes this chunky young Pinot Noir. Although the grapes were destemmed before fermentation, the tannins are significant, a reflection of the low yields and tough skins the berries develop. In fact, the wine is almost Zinny in its full body and spicy, briary fruit. It clearly needs time. Best after 2011.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A little soft and heavy on the nose, which conveys a sense of overripeness. In the mouth, it's not overly heavy but it is sort of chunky as flavors of apple and citrus brush up against mealy but then draw back to a fresher place. Finishes mild, with only a modicum of acidity. Drink soon for best results.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"A touch riper and richer than the Hillside, McCall's Reserve Pinot Noir offers fleshy, penetrating black-cherry flavor cooled by a vein of menthol and herbs. It's luscious and velvety on the palate yet totally poised, bolstered by brisk acidity and persistent but fine tannins. Drinks well already but should hold nicely through 2025.",US-New York-Pinot Noir
"This has value written all over it, offering fleshy, ripe tropical aromas and flavors. The personality is large and in charge, yet the wine itself remains reasonably balanced and firm in structure.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Luscious and thick, this is precisely the kind of Pinot Grigio you'll want to pair with salmon, white meat, asparagus or leafy spinach and ricotta ravioli. It has structure and penetration and ends with a swirl of passion fruit, pineapple and yellow rose.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"This is one aggressive varietal wine. The nose is packed with sweaty leather and olive notes, while the palate is rough and tart at the edges. There are notes of cola and burnt coffee on the finish, but by then you may just grow tired of wrestling with it.",Chile-Maule Valley-Carmenère
"The wine, from the area north of Pouilly-Fumé, is brightly lit with fine acidity and green fruits. It is also textured, bringing out the chalk and flint soil of the areas. Drink this fruity lightly structured wine now.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Made with Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc, this offers aromas of toasted oak, cedar, mocha and plum. The fresh palate delivers juicy blackberry, black cherry, vanilla, dark chocolate and tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins. A licorice note tops off the lingering finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"This wine is a bold but well-mannered blockbuster that serves generous helpings of dark color, spicy aromas, concentrated flavors and a luxurious dry texture. It needs full-flavored, rich food to accompany it, and will deliver a lot of pleasure under those circumstances. Best to drink now through 2020.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"One of the plusses to having a cash-flow brand like Yellow Tail in the portfolio is that it gives the owners the opportunity to properly age their high-end wines prior to release. At 10 years old, this has acquired a veneer of silkiness and elegance that enfolds the cassis and red-currant fruit. There's no shortage of smoky, vanilla and brown-sugar inflected oak either. Drink now–2025.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Very crisp, this young, fruity wine has intense apple and citrus acidity over its bitter almond character and light mousse. It needs a few months of bottle aging to soften the acidity.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"Brander's annual Bordeaux blend features 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot. There is ripe boysenberry, cedar and worn leather on the nose, followed by Bing cherry flavors on the palate, where acidity and a light body combine for a lively finish.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of cigar box, herb and cherry are followed by bright tart acid-driven cranberry flavors. The tannins bring a light astringency but it delivers a lot of enjoyment.",US-Washington-Sangiovese
"Oaky toast and cherry jam meet tangy, juicy acidity in this grippy wine that's firm in velvety tannin. With a balance of power, it reveals chocolate mocha and black currant in equal measure, the minerality from the site's iron-rich red rocky soil on full display.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Concentrated in cherry, spiced plum, cola, milk chocolate and beef jerky notes, this wine is a blend of 61% Tempranillo, 23% Malbec, 14% Mourvèdre and 2% Alicante Bouschet. Soy, blueberry, black plum and black raspberry entertain the palate, where smoke and pepper round out the nuances.",US-California-Red Blend
"Full bodied and opulent, yet remarkably refreshing at the same time, wines like this are why the commune of Laudun is so highly regarded as a white-wine terroir within the warm Southern Rhône. Honey, pineapple and stone fruit notes linger through the finish, balanced by hints of crushed stone and citrus. Drink now.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style White Blend
"Full and generous, this has creamy peach and apricot aromas backed by a slightly spicy touch of vanilla bean and caramel. Pair this wine with coconut curry.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio

Opens with sweet cherry and raspberry fruit but turns noticeably crisp in the mouth while some nice gamy notes appear on the silky finish. An ideal pairing for roast suckling pig.,US-Virginia-Cabernet Franc
"Aromas of coffee, graphite, herb, barrel spice and black fruit lead to a power-packed palate full of dark fruit and earth flavors supported by chewy tannins. It's a classic Red Mountain style, not shy but delivering the goods with a long life ahead of it.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A lovely and complex Cabernet from this mountain in the southerly Mayacamas chain. It shows the big, firm tannins of its origins, with a dry sturdiness backing up the intense black currant flavors. Drinkable now for sheer decadence, although it also seems to have the stuffing to age for a decade.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's an immediate pithy tension on the nose of this bottling from a producer in the game since 1933, with Brie-cheese rind, fresh Greek yogurt and and grapefruit-peel aromas. The flavors are intriguing, hard to pin down and alluring, with exotic citrus and varied stone fruit, light honeysuckle and crushed slate mixed with chalky structure. Simmering acidity keeps the flavors coming.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The slightly more evolved nose that effortlessly fuses crushed chamomile leaf and lemon zest also hints at dark fir honey. It glides seamlessly into a fast-flowing, straight channel of acidity. There is movement and poise in this virtual journey into freshness and aroma. It is the lemon that lasts longest on the palate, which is dry and of exquisite purity.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Citrus, red plum and currant aromas are wild and gamy. This has an edgy mouthfeel with a rubbery sensation, while citrus and candied red-berry flavors hum along.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Pinot Noir
"A pure expression of California, this Petite Sirah is soft as velvet, and explosively seductive in very ripe blackberry and cherry jam, violet, anise, cocoa and smoky vanilla flavors. It's a simple wine, but a very delicious one.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Upon pouring, there's a slight haze of CO2 visible in the glass—but that's a good thing in this case, because the unreleased fermentation gasses help enliven the otherwise fat mouthfeel. With aromas of pears and fresh parsley and flavors of pears and pineapple, it's pretty standard stuff, but executed well.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Year in and year out, this around where this wine shakes out. The nose is clean and nice for an under-$10 white, with minerality and fresh white-fruit aromas. A light, focused palate offers up green melon, apple, herb and white pepper flavors in front of a crisp finish. This varietal Viura outperforms its price.",Spain-Northern Spain-Viura
"This is a wine with harshness, sharp walnut and bitter orange flavors. It gives off a hard feeling that probably won't soften much.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"From a selection of parcels, this is a ripe and fruity wine. Vines aged on average 55 years have produced a ripe concentrated wine with opulent yellow fruits that are balanced by citrus acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Sourced entirely from the Milbrandt vineyards, this is a riot of honey, tea and mint highlights, with excellent acidity and ripe tree fruits. The length and density are outstanding for this price point.",US-Washington-Riesling

"Aromatic, herbal wine, with evocative lavender, a core of dry tannins, fresh red plum juice fruit and flavors of wild thyme. The six years' aging has given the wine just the right amount of maturity to drink now.",France-Provence-Rhône-style Red Blend
"The vineyard sources for this Bordeaux-style blend—Champoux, Ciel du Cheval, Weinbau and Dineen—are impeccable, and represent four of the best AVAs in Washington. It's almost exactly half and half Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, and smells like beautifully ripe blackberries, boysenberries and cassis. It sets up in the mouth firm and textural, and adds layers of chocolate and baking spices as it winds through the finish. Not a soft wine, but more open and accessible than most vintages of Soos Creek.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"A bouquet with tomato leaf, spice, dust and saucy berry aromas sets the stage for a basic feeling palate. Saucy red plum flavors are offset by sweet, oaky molasses notes, while a touch of nutmeg and oak character rise up late.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A Côtes du Rhône-style blend meant to be drunk early and around a weekday meal, among Terre Rouge's easiest to drink and find wines. There's lots to like, from the wine's high-toned cherry and boysenberry aromas and flavors to its traces of black olive and jaunty, gamy pepper.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend

"The color is quite deep and golden, the aroma is earthy and the flavors are strong, grapy and very ripe. This wine is full bodied and almost sweet.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Harry's passion evidently is for sweet, soft, simple wines, to judge by this one. Almost totally devoid of balancing crispness and vitality, it has syrupy flavors of blackberry jam and melted chocolate.",US-California-Syrah

"The immediate impression is that this wine is heavy, ripe and oaky. Sawdust and wood grain are the lead aromas. In the mouth, this chunky Priorat is hard, with grating tannins. Hickory and toasted berry flavors finish hot and resiny.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"From a little-known region of Western Australia, this is a restrained, structured example of Chardonnay that may drink well for 5–6 years. Subtle vanilla and bacon shadings upfront add nuance to the melon and pear aromas. Flavors are of soft, fully ripe tree fruit and melon, but held in check by citrusy notes and crisp acids.",Australia-Western Australia-Chardonnay
"Deep, sweet and lusty on the nose, with a hint of animal and whole lot of black fruit. The palate is saturated and jammy, with roasted, ripe berry flavors and a ripe, silky finish. Not hard or tannic in the least, with a spot of Priorat's patented schisty minerality. Drink now through 2015.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Layers of wood and bramble juxtapose flavors of pressed apple, pear and lemon here. While its light-bodied style and brisk acidity are refreshing, it finishes on slightly bitter tones of sap and resin. Drink now through 2019.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"There's a pretty touch of carnation florals to the dried black fruit and black cherry center of this wine. Spicy notes of black pepper, whole clove and black tea leaves appear in the mouth alongside juicy blackberry and fudgy brownie flavors.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Crisp and bright in lemon and apple, Atrea also has a honeyed richness to it, especially on the finish. A blend of almost equal Roussanne and Viognier, the latter comes from Lolonis's very old, dry-farmed vines. Refreshing, this wine is begging for spicy food.",US-California-White Blend
"A very rich, soft, complex wine, twice the size of L&R;'s regular 07 Cab Franc. Just oozes sweet, ripe mashed cherry fruit flavors, sweetened with brown sugar and sprinkled with cinnamon, ground roasted pecans and vanilla. The name refers to the clone number.

"Smooth and textured, this is a supple, lightly earthy and aromatic Bordeaux-style blend. The principal components are Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with smaller amounts of Malbec and Petit Verdot. One gets the feeling that the winery was still finding its way during production; this was made by a winemaker no longer at Corliss. Berry, plum, fig, dried herb and cedar are all in the mix—it's more genteel than generous.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a nicely balanced wine from estate-grown vines, a mix of licorice and raspberry that offers luxurious mouthfeel and texture atop surprising acidity. A small amount of Viognier was used in fermentation to provide some additional lift and floral aromas, while a dustiness prevails on the finish.",US-California-Syrah
"A blend of Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and a dollop of Petit Verdot, this has subtle aromas of ground pepper, toast, French oak and espresso. The aromas follow over to the rather lean, straightforward palate along with a note of fresh cherry set against loose-knit, fine-grained tannins. Enjoy over the next few years.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This has good balance among its ripe blackberry and red-plum flavors and its firm core. It's solid and chunky while also offering crisp, taut acidity. The aftertaste, with a touch of smokiness, is attractive.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is gorgeous, showing the sophistication and complexity. It's delicate and bright, but it shows power and determination at the same time. The aromatic intensity is very impressive, and the bouquet recalls notes of cassis, leather, licorice, cola and dried ginger. Hold for 10 years or more.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"With a dominance of Tinta Roriz, this is a smooth, ripe wine that has spice and blackberry fruits. It is dense and rich, packed with juicy fruitiness as well as some firm tannins. There is a burn at the end from the alcohol that does spoil the aftertaste.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red

"Dense and intense, with loads of fine-grained tannin, this is a deep, dark-colored wine with oodles of flavor and a very thick texture. As massive as it is in texture though, delicious flavors like blackberry, blueberry and dark chocolate come through and then linger on the finish. Drink from 2016 to 2026.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"This late-release GG is a stunning showcase of how just a few years of bottle age impact a dry, richly concentrated Riesling. Yellow peach and grapefruit tones shine brightly still, but are glazed by layers of slick, penetrating minerals. While moderate in alcohol, it feels dense and creamy on the palate. The finish meanders almost endlessly, punctuated playfully by strikes of lemon-lime acidity. It's singing now, but should improve till at least 2020.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Aromas of orange peel, flowers, blue fruit and smoked meat are followed by light, spritely fruit flavors. The tannins bring some grip.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Aged for six months in wood, this juicy wine with its red-berry fruits is stylish and full bodied. It has tannins that act as a support to the bold fruits and firm structure. That suggests the wine, although ready to drink now, will also age. Drink now or keep until 2018.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Penfolds' 2009 Yattarna blends fruit from Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia, but remains a lean, taut Chardonnay. Flavors are crisp and citrusy, primarily kumquat, lemon and lime at this young age. Give it several years to see if it comes around.",Australia-Australia Other-Chardonnay
"The Sims is amped up in 2014, dark and thick and showing a roasted character. Mocha, black tea and Kahlua flavors push the palate into a gritty charred mode. It's delicious, liquorous, and suitable for smoky ribs or a juicy burger. Drink now through 2020.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Grapes from the vines around the 13th-century castle of La Bastide are sent to the Marmandais co-op for a separate bottling. This smooth and ripe wine shows plenty of rich mango and apricot flavors cut by lime acidity that gives a lift of freshness. Drink now, although the wine will age until 2018.",France-Southwest France-Sauvignon Blanc
"A herbal touch of crushed lemon balm and apple peel makes for an intriguing, inviting nose. The palate adds fresh apple notes to these subtle herb notes and remains totally juicy and lively. This seems far fresher than its six years and the herbal tinges are just the beginning of maturity. This is lovely, concentrated and spirited stuff with a whistle-clean utterly dry finish. Testaments to Riesling's longevity.",France-Alsace-Riesling

"Produced from Chardonnay grown on the Montagne de Reims and in the Sézanne region further south, this is a fresh wine, more fruity than mineral although with a definite tilt towards citrus acidity and perfumed acidity. It's delicate, stylish and the bottling is ready to drink. Palmer is the brand name for a grouping of seven growers.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"This low-production Pinot Noir is dry, silky and enormously complex, with cherry pie, Dr. Pepper, bacon, anise and white pepper flavors, plus a woodsy suggestion of pine needle. Oak aging adds the perfect touch of smoke. Good as it is, it should improve in the bottle over the next 4–5 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Cobblestone's regular Cabernet is very consistent from year to year, a good wine but not a great one. This 2007 is superfruity, with a blast of blackberries, cola and currants. Drink now–2015.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Despite its recent vintage, this is a wine that is already tasting mature. The palate is layered with secondary flavors touched with floral perfume, intense acidity and a dry aftertaste. It's not for aging, so enjoy now.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Big, bold fruit and penetrating tannins mark this lush, powerful Cabernet Franc. Rich black cherry and berry flavors penetrate the palate, layered in streaks of smoke, spice and cranberry acidity. It's a potent wine to mature till at least 2018.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"Ripe and also tannic, this is structured wine, its berry fruits pushing through a dry plum skin texture. It is solid and chunky while remaining fresh and fruity.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Floral and fleshy, this is a big-boned, concentrated wine. A ripe rendering of apple, pear and peach is spiked in intriguing seasonings of lemongrass and nutmeg.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Some tropical passionfruit notes manage to appear despite the aromatic restraint, on the palate they find their expression, but are balanced by fresh lemony flavors that are almost thirst-quenching in this cracking and slender wine.",Austria-Südsteiermark-Sauvignon Blanc
"This offers aromas of yellow stone fruit and pressed acacia flower. On the lean palate, racy acidity frames suggestions of yellow apple skin, lime and salty mineral while a bitter almond note marks the close.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"Wet clay, tomato paste, oregano and carob aromas form the bouquet that's more strained than smooth. The palate is lively and herbal in flavor, with a baked berry note that ends in a wash of herb. It gets better with airing.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Merlot
"Made from all free-run juice with no oak, this wine by 40-year veteran Frederic Brander shows candied lemon and lime peels on the approachable, inviting nose, along with fresh-cut apples and a growing passionfruit perfume. The passionfruit tang also shows on the palate alongside ripe limes and a lingering grassy note, held together by grippy acidity and pithy texture.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Meaty, dry and balanced yet big, this is a substantial mouthful of Rosé. Made from Dry Creek Zinfandel with 12% Syrah, it's brooding in dark berry and peach fruit and can be paired much as a full-bodied red wine would be.",US-California-Zinfandel
Delicate aromas of orchard fruit and white spring flower mingle together while the reserved but refined palate offers green apple and mineral. Crisp acidity and a hint of mineral give it a clean finish.,Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Bianco
"A tight, bright wine that is on the dry side of Brut, but with enough dosage to give a soft feel. It has apple and lively lime and lemon flavors with a strong stripe of minerality to bring out the texture. This bottling could do with waiting until mid-2015 in bottle.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"One of the few red dessert wines with obvious new-oak flavors, this wine smells smoky and toasty. It tastes sweet and black peppery, and is very full bodied.",US-California-Red Blend

"Full-throttle lime, peach and strawberry aromas come through on the nose, with a trace of toast. It drinks as fruity as it smells. There’s some pretty toast and good acidity, and it finishes fruity and a little sweet.",US-California-Champagne Blend
"This is notable for its complexity and stylish blend of grape, berry and bramble flavors. The fruit is matched with polished tannins, streaks of iron and earth, and a citrusy highlight.",US-Washington-Syrah
This wine starts out quite reduced before it blows off. Aromas of toast and barrel spices are followed by elegant fruit flavors. It goes down easy.,US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Fresh, vibrant and tangy, this is a great example of a dry light-bodied but very appetizing wine. Canteloupe and peach aromas lead to citrus and raspberry flavors that are lean but tasty. It's one of the best California Sangiovese rosés.",US-California-Sangiovese
"Recioto's saturated ruby color is irresistible and Fabiano's version is an excellent example. The aromas are vibrant and generous, including black cherry, blueberry, exotic spice, caramel, toasted almond and chocolate. This wine has a chewy texture with sweet tannins and long-lasting chocolate-like flavors.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Although the tannins give this wine a hard astringency, they can't mask the richness of the fruit. Once you get used to the tannins, you find a blast of cherry and blackberry jam fruit. This is a wine to put in the cellar until 2018.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Very rich, this is all about structure and pure elegance. Flavors are of fresh white fruits with touches of green pepper, alongside honey, lemon and crisp sweetness. A wine for aging.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Nice structure on this dry, smooth Cab, which is made in the modern cult style of soft, immediate likeability. The blackberry, cassis, cherry and oak flavors are appealing. But at this price, you have a right to demand more depth and complexity.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"High Note reaches the high notes, the middle notes and the bass notes. It starts with dark berry aromas and clarity, while the palate is lively and fresh, with cherry and a light undercurrent of olive for flavors. A full, honest Malbec with size, character and balance.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This is a rich, spicy and lush-fruited rosé. Its palate-pleasing tangle of citrus, peach and light tropical fruit is fresh, forward and inviting. It spent five months in neutral oak and is ready for immediate enjoyment.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"From the rocky, volcanic soils of the mighty, high-elevation vineyard, this wine imparts generous layers of blood-red berry, smoke, vanilla and cranberry, a testament to terroir and unobtrusive winemaking. Powerfully built in tight, leathery structure, it conveys a distinct taste of that volcanic rock.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This shows really attractive floral notes on the nose, followed by smoldering, dark flavors of roasted root vegetables and caramelized black cherries. It's full-bodied and maybe even a bit chunky on the palate, so give it until 2016–2017 to settle down and smooth out.",New Zealand-Martinborough-Pinot Noir

Forward aromas and flavors of vanilla and melted butter give a lot of richness to this medium-bodied wine. It has a candy-like quality and a creamy sweet-seeming finish.,US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a big, bold wine with superripe fruit. It is saved from great excess by its tannins and acidity. It does have some bitterness from the high toast wood aging. The wine should soften out to leave a rich fruity wine. Drink from 2021.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Lots to like in this creative blend of Vermentino, Verdelho, Viognier and Sauvignon Blanc. It's well acidified, with citrus, orange blossom, peach, apricot, buttercream and mineral flavors. Just a bit too sweet, though, with a sugary taste throughout.",US-California-White Blend
"Shows ripe, grapey raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with a bite of citrusy acidity. A good Pinot Noir for drinking with roast salmon or a juicy hamburger.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Clos Apalta, depending on your point of view, is arguably Chile's best wine. And this vintage is outstanding! Earth, minty spice, ripe berry, minerality and smoky aromas cover the bases. It's superbly structured, with a fine texture and depth. Tastes lush and complex, with blackberry, crème de cassis, fine herbs and tobacco. Finishes classy. Drink now through 2016.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Red Blend
"Made from Nerello Mascalese that was harvested in 2010 and 2011, this dry wine opens with bold aromas of berry, dried fruit and cassis. Tangy acidity gives the wine a bright and lively mouthfeel. Overall, it's silky, long and intense.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nerello Mascalese
"A simple Pinot Noir, light-bodied and spicy, with some nice cherry-raspberry flavors. Half the winery's profits go to children's hospitals.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is one dark, intense Ribera del Duero with loads of lush black-fruit aromas matched against minerality and fine French-oak scents. It is tight as a drum on the palate, with wiry acidity and rocky tannins. Flavors of oak-driven coconut and cream sit on top of blackberry and cola, while the finish ends abruptly, with hardness. Drink through 2024; 150 cases made.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Brambly red berry and sour cherry notes are fleshy and ripe in this brawny, full-bodied Bordeaux-style blend. It's unabashedly primary in style with soft, plushy texture. Finishes with a bit of heat.",US-New York-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A soft, delicious Pinot, although you should give it an hour or two in a decanter to let it breathe. It's rich and sweet in raspberry, cherry, brown sugar and cinnamon flavors, showing the warmth of its vineyard origin. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine emits details of iron and citrus rind along with somewhat stark, tight fruit flavors that are often associated with Red Mountain Syrah. Racy and bracing, this will improve with 1–2 more years in the bottle.",US-Washington-Syrah
Black fruits dominate this dense wine with a rich texture and a structure packed with ripe tannins. It is an impressive bottling from this single-owner Grand Cru. Dark and firm it will need aging. Drink from 2022.,France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"The raspberry, cherry and vanilla flavors of this Pinot Noir taste sweet, giving it a delicious pie-filling richness. Crisp acidity fortunately provides balancing structure. It's a flashy young wine for drinking over the next five years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Here's a luminous sparkling wine that plays up its Italian good cheer. It's a simple and straightforward expression with characteristic aromas of cut grass, stone fruit and citrus that makes for an informal but very satisfying ensemble.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"It's very dry and tart. Strong flavors of lemon juice are accompanied by biting acids and even some dusty tannins, but it's a clean, zesty drink. —S.H.",US-California-Pinot Blanc
"Hay yellow in the glass, this rosé isn't pink at all, but offers inviting aromas of seltzer, crushed chalk, light lemon peels and yellow apples. The palate is quite mellow, which is pleasing, showing flavors of cider apple, dough and grapefruit peel.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"94-96 Barrel sample. Lots of new wood here, maybe too dominant. But it is a stage, because the fruit weight is also there to give a wine of considerable complexity, dry and solid.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Tightly wound and acidic, with forceful red-berry flavors that are spicy and zesty. Finishes a little on the raw side, with cranberry notes and a hard crescendo. Tempranillo with Garnacha and Cabernet.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"The vineyard is in a cooler area of Napa, and the wine seems to have been the victim of the chilly vintage. Flavors of blackberries have vegetal hints that are distracting.",US-California-Merlot

"Grecanico, Fiano, Chardonnay and Viognier comprise the blend, offering pretty floral aromas that are wrapped with tones of lemon and peach.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"A masterpiece it may be, but right now, in its precocious youth, it's all jammy fruit and smoky oak. But what jam! What oak! Tastes rich and compellingly good, like being swept away on a tidal wave of blackberry essence and cocoa. Very good, very rich, very fine, but you want to stash it away for a few years to let the parts meld.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This hearty Barbera del Monferrato offers surprisingly thick concentration and loads of bright fruit intensity. It's an inky, dark wine with bright nuances of cherry and blackberry and although there's a vinous, raw aspect to the bouquet, the mouthfeel is attractively thick and chewy.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"There's a delicate whiff of dried orange peel and apple cider vinegar on the nose of this unique Finger Lakes Riesling, but the palate is chock full of fresh apples accented by a sweet tangerine acidity and hints of clove and spice.",US-New York-Riesling
"This fragrant Falanghina shows bright aromas of white flower, jasmine and honeysuckle. Very subtle tones of banana and pineapple fill in the back and give the wine momentum and depth on the finish.",Italy-Southern Italy-Falanghina
"Super ripe, with vivacious, youthful plum and berry fruit. This Sangiovese/ Cabernet Sauvignon blend from near Scansano is solid and sassy, with lots of spunk. The finish is long and very fruity, with lively tannins. It can be drunk now, but it could probably use a couple of years to fully come together.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This lean wine, all acidity and tannins, has a severe character that is not likely to go away. The estate has been handed down from mother to daughter for seven generations and now owned by enologist Marie Laure Latorre. It was named for the Merlot plot planted on 08/11/99, the date of the last total solar eclipse seen in France.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Old vines help give smoothness and concentration to this ripe wine. It has soft tannins, well integrated into the black cherry fruits, and acidity. With its spice and rounded texture, it is a wine to drink now.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This wine is still settling into the bottle, with light spritzy scents of honeysuckle, pear and ripe peach. The off-dry stone-fruit flavors exhibit well-balanced acidity that carries through the finish. The concentration comes off as somewhat light but what's there is good.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Shows the coolness of the vintage with a tartly acidic mouthfeel that gives the cherry and raspberry flavors a sour candy feel. Other flavors include mint and a pleasantly sweet touch of butterscotch from oak. Other than the sharpness, this is a pretty nice Pinot.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A big success, this a wine that manages to combine the ripeness of Merlot fruit from 2005 with impressive tannins and power and still have structure and acidity. This should age well over 10 years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"In its youthful state, the wine has an earthy character that will soon move into a ripe, fruity while always structured state. Rich and  fruity now, it's likely to become a serious, ageworthy wine.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Blended with 7% Petit Verdot and 7% Petite Sirah, this velvety and dense wine conveys a pronounced element of charred oak. A reduced note from the barrel permeates at first before allowing aromas and flavors of baked plum to show.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The quiet but full-fruited concentration of ripe yellow pears seems to be distilled here. While the aromatic expression is restrained, the palate shows concentration, warmth and phenolic grip—but an equally concentrated acidity provides backbone and lift.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"Aged in mostly new French oak, this wine's barrel influences stand out. Notes of coffee and cinnamon come alongside herbs and brown stems, with the oak bringing some grit to the tannins.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"From the Pratt Vineyard on Sexton Road, this impressive offering is bold and lush, smoothly textured even in its concentration of thick red cherry and forest. It exalts in a shock of white pepper that is beautiful to behold.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This limited edition wine from Passarella's original vineyard is wood-fermented, bringing out a creamy texture and the natural richness of the fruit. It's deliciously rich, laced with spiced apple and white stone fruit flavors, and will be ready to drink from 2018.",Portugal-Dão-Encruzado
"Hints of lightly toasted oak highlight bright, fresh apple and lemon flavors on this easy drinking Chardonnay. Delicately structured with a vibrant, zesty acidity, it finishes with just a hint of sea breeze.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"This wine is tightly wound and thickly colored. Full bodied in style, it shows plenty of oak influence, aged in entirely French oak for 16 months, 42% of it new. Cranberry and sour cherry dominate in terms of fruit, with an underlying agenda of clove and tea.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A ripe, raspberry flavored wine that is crisp while also very fruity. It has attractive acidity and a refreshing, juicy aftertaste that is irresistible. Drink now.",France-France Other-Rosé
"Sourced from near the town of Sebastopol, in a site rich in Goldridge soils, this wine is juicy and complex, founded on a core of orange and cherry, with a tang of acidity that competes with the lushness. A brushy forest-floor note lies underneath the fruit, providing a lovely, savory counterpoint to the succulence.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The oak (50% new French wood) seems a bit heavy handed, interjecting scents of wood, coffee and vanilla on the aromas and flavors. It's a shame as the cranberry flavors otherwise provide interest.",US-Washington-Syrah
A light wine with some smoky flavors but mainly soft red-berry fruits and accompanying acidity. The wine has a round texture and a spicy aftertaste.,France-Southwest France-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Pinched and sharp on the nose, this has nettle and citrus aromas that are more typical of Sauvignon Blanc than of Chardonnay. It feels juicy and acidic, with passion fruit, grapefruit and lasting citrus flavors. It's fresh and racy, but it's varietally confusing.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"This elegant sparkler opens with alluring aromas of fragrant jasmine, wisteria and white peach. Thanks to 80-year old vines, the linear palate has both finesse and concentration, offering ripe yellow apple, Bartlett pear, energizing mineral tones and a saline note alongside a creamy mousse.",Italy-Veneto-Glera

"With a high proportion of the local Rolle grape in the blend, this is a lightly perfumed wine with a strong herbal element. It is a ripe finely structured wine, with great acidity and orange flavors. A style of wine that will be better for a few more months, it should be drunk from late 2017.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This impressive 100% varietal wine comes from Cold Creek, Candy Mountain and Windrow vineyards. With the oak (40% new French) pleasantly restrained, it offers aromas of dried herbs, coffee, cherry and light barrel spices.

An intriguing blend of 43% Merlot, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Petit Verdot and 17% Malbec, it offers high-toned aromas, with notes of toasty spice and herb in front of raspberry and cherry. Supple and well balanced, the fruit flavors show poise and length.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Sharp, piercing aromas of pineapple and steel yield a bit prior to a tangy, citrusy palate. There's some chalk and slate on the finish, which adds an element of complexity. The only noticeable fault here is a candied sweetness at the tail end",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Familiar berry aromas blend with hard spice notes and a hint of blueberry. Like many 2013s, this is showing a clamped-down mouthfeel along with flavors of peppery black fruits. A limited finish is hard and compact. Drink or hold for another five or more years; this isn't going anywhere.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Aromas of grass and green citrus fruits are just pungent enough. This is basic but lively in the mouth, with grassy flavors and citrus notes of grapefruit and lime. A chalky finish is cleansing.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a lightly aromatic wine, with notes of lees, apple, mineral and spice. It's medium bodied, with a thick, textured feel showing good weight and intensity to the fruit flavors alongside well-balanced acidity.

"Even nearing the age of four, this wine can't quite overcome its rustic tannins and sharp finish, and never will. With rich blackberry and cassis flavors, it will wash down a nice steak.",US-California-Petit Verdot
"Fresh and fruity, this is a bright wine, full of almost shocking acidity and red-currant fruits. Its tannins are there, although more of an afterthought to the fruit. Drink this light fresh wine from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of grilled herb, French oak, scorched earth and menthol lead the nose. The juicy, accessible palate offers Morello cherry, vanilla, orange peel and a hint of mocha alongside fine-grained but rather fleeting tannins. Drink through 2017.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Though it's 100% Merlot from Red Mountain, this seems more generic than representative of what that AVA can produce. It could be any modestly priced Bordeaux red variety or blend—red fruits, stiff tannins, and a seamless, yet one-dimensional mouthfeel.",US-Washington-Merlot
Strawberry and graphite meet with a rusty element on the nose of this easy-to-quaff and yet intriguing and well-priced wine. A nice ripe pomegranate element on the palate leads to licorice and a gunmetal minerality.,US-California-Pinot Noir

"This feels thin and common, with notes of tangerine and buttered toast. It's a wine to drink at parties and such.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Big and bold, this is a massive Touriga Nacional, emphasizing the structure as much as the fruit.

It could do with a year's aging, so drink from early 2017.",Portugal-Alentejano-Touriga Nacional
"Zesty on the nose, with whiffs of orange rind, lemon and pineapple, this bright, zippy beerenauslese counters laser-focused acidity with creamy honey and marmalade flavors. Pleasantly astringent, it finishes on a bracing pink-grapefruit note. It's delicious now, but its honeyed citrus palate should gain complexity and dimension over the next 5–10 years.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Lots of oak in this wine. With buttered toast and butterscotch flavors, it overpowers the underlying orange and lemon fruit, which isn't strong enough to stand up under all that wood.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a new variety for the popular Acrobat brand. The fruit leans toward the sour side of apple, and the mouthfeel has not quite come together. Odds are that this wine will benefit from further bottle age; meanwhile, a good decanting is recommended.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Dusty plum, prune and leafy notes appear on a plump but somewhat flat nose. This is jammy and chunky in feel, with flavors of stewed berry fruits and herbal hints. Syrupy notes and a fig character add weight to an oaky finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Succulent blackberry, spiced blueberry, licorice, ground white pepper and carob all come together on this full-bodied, chewy red. Ripe, round tannins support the juicy flavors.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Cannonau
"Reuilly has the peculiarity of having rosés from Pinot Gris, even though its reds are from Pinot Noir. This perfumed wine with its pale color brings out the slightly dusty character of the grape. That's contrasted with the intense acidity and black currant fruit flavors. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Rosé

Plush, rich flavors cap it off.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This full-flavored rosé is principally Sangiovese. Packed with fresh flavors of strawberry, raspberry and cherry, it carries a touch of orange Creamsicle into the smooth finish. It's delicious and detailed and belongs at the top of your list of must-have summer rosés.",US-Oregon-Rosé
"Aged in a combination of French, American and Hungarian oak for 14 months, Hazlitt's Cabernet balances ripe, rich blackberry flavor with toasty hints of graham cracker and soft velvety tannins that coat the palate. Crisp yet concentrated, it finishes long with soft notes of dried herbs.",US-New York-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Les Cailloux is a traditional-style Châteauneuf-du-Pape, with only the small Syrah component being aged in barrel. The 80% Grenache speaks the loudest, bursting with cherry fruit, dried spice and crushed stone notes that come to a refined, silky finish. Drink now–2025.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend

The barrel influences (40% new) are well displayed, but the rest of the wine needs more time to catch up.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This blend of Merlot, Refosco and Cabernet Sauvignon offers dense flavors of plum extract, red currant and bell pepper that are layered with oak, vanilla and chocolate. However, it lacks energy, and you'll notice the warmth of alcohol as well as a bitter, wood finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Red Blend
"The nose is a blend of peach and earth. The palate comes with great intensity, holding against the sweetness with an exquisitely delicious streak of quinine bitterness which lends direction and precision, along with tangy lemon freshness.

This earthy wine has overripe fruit aromas and sweet apple flavors. It's medium-bodied and soft in texture.,US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

"This 100% Syrah conveys espresso, raw meat, flowers, chocolate and peppery spices. It's reserved in style with tart acids.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This open, soft wine brings out some of the ripe fruit flavors of the vintage. It has attractive melon and apricot fruit along with a tight streak of mineral acidity. It's ready to drink now, although it will be better from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"Very pale in color, this '07 Gewurz, tasted just 6 months after harvest, was a bit muted. Airing brings out rich, spicy aromas and flavors ranging from green apples and peaches to dates, vanilla, wildflowers and dusty spices. The wine was barrel-fermented.",US-California-Gewürztraminer

Finishes with size, pepper and dark spice flavors. 250 cases made.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Syrah
"This is a special selection from parcels of vines in Château Castéra. Stewed plum aromas lead to a wine that is lean, leaving little room for the fruit.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"If you like heavyweight Tempranillo, this is a textbook rendition. It's deep and dark, with earth, leather and oak in addition to monster black fruit on the nose.

"Coming from Cerro Prieto Vineyard, one of the few places to grow Pinot Noir in this appellation, this bottling shows aromas of clove, vanilla, sandalwood and pomegranate on the nose. Light pomegranate and tart red-fruit flavors dominate the palate, with a touch of dried herb.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The nose is still closed and just gives us a whiff of white pepper. The palate is beautifully slender and has a lighter touch of just-ripe blueberry and red cherry.

"Other wineries have produced very good vineyard-designated Cabs from this mountain property. Now Brandlin has a go, and the wine shows promise. It's considerably more tannic than most expensive New Age Napa Cabs, so dry and astringent that it demands cellar time. But it should develop, to judge from the powerful core of black currant fruit. Best after 2008 and through 2012, at least.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Soft and silky in rich red fruit, this is an intense wine, boldly flavored and densely textured, indicative of both the variety and the vintage. Let this complex baby air before pairing with grilled meats or risotto.",US-California-Syrah

"A jammy wine it has ripe red berry fruits, soft tannins and a red plum jelly flavor. It will age quickly, so drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The winery held this back an additional six months after their other 2008 Pinots were released, presumably to let it become integrated. Still, it's quite tannic, with a sandpaper-like toughness. Despite the astringency, the massive wild-cherry, cola, mushroom and anise flavors come through. It's a huge wine, feral and untamed—quite exquisite in its wildness. So delicious now, it's hard to resist, but the wise collector will cellar it for 4–5 years, maybe even longer.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Enticing aromas of rose, violet, mature berry and a whiff of leather lead the way on this structured red. The full-bodied palate offers layers of dried black cherry, leather, tobacco and grilled herbs, supported by a backbone of firm, ripe tannins. Hold for even more complexity. Drink 2018–2028.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"Neither nose nor palate give much away in the way of aroma, but there is some fresh citrus. The palate is refreshing in a rather neutral but very clean way.",France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"Lime, apple and mineral aromas come with a note of eggy yeast. The mouthfeel is regular and a touch foamy, with semisweet flavors of kiwi, apple and gooseberry. Mild and feeling good on the finish, it's basic but well worth a go.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Here's a bright young Chardonnay marked by the crisp, tingly acids that you so often find in Edna Valley wines. The fruit is vibrant, offering a burst of Meyer lemons, limes, kiwis and figs, and the finish is thoroughly dry. The alcohol level, by the way, is a relatively low 13.5%.",US-California-Chardonnay
This wine puts the floral aspects of the varietal front and center. Rose petal and flower-soap aromas lead onto the palate that bears similar flavors and a hint of residual sugar. It shows nice concentration.,US-Washington-Gewürztraminer
"Laurence Féraud, the stylish power behind Domaine de Pégaü in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, also produces her own négociant line of wines.

Drink now–2024.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is a full and rounded Blanc de Blancs with Chardonnay fruitiness tempered by both bottle aging and the steely structure that lies in the background. An intense mineral character on the palate is balanced by apricot and brisk, fresh acidity. The bottle is ready to drink now but could improve with age as well.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"Spicy and jumpy on the nose, with pine and juniper notes coming alongside more normal berry and cherry scents. The palate has a severe snappy, citrusy, narrow feel and flavors of cherry, red plum and cherry tomato. Lightly herbal and oaky on the finish, with good length.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo

"From red slate vineyards in Erden and Ürzig, this is a medium-bodied dry Riesling that delivers bold pineapple, apple and citrus notes accented by hints of dry spices. The zesty acids impart a tongue-tingling quality to the long finish. Drink now–2013.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Comes across as slightly rich, sweet and heavy for a kabinett, but this wine remains very enjoyable for its lush, sweet flavors of ripe peaches, baked apple and honey.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"The producer's Russian River Valley fruit comes from the Winside Vineyard, planted long ago by Anne Moller-Racke and Joe Nugent. It astounds in this must-have wine, complex and ridiculously velvety in texture. Pepper, clove and cardamom ride huge waves of baked fruit and mocha, with the structure to age through at least 2026, but why wait when it's so delicious now?",US-California-Pinot Noir
"From one of the small wine areas close to Chablis, this delicious, steely, crisp wine has fine acidity and a tight texture. It's cool, fresh and refreshing with a light, dancing aftertaste.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"Retro makes one of the best, most consistent Petite Sirahs in California. Even though they used to source their fruit from Howell Mountain and this bottling now is from Pope Valley and Calistoga, it still shows the same qualities of complex interest based on impeccable winemaking. It's an amazing wine, dry, full-bodied and tannic, with a complex range of berries, currants, herbs and white pepper. Truly a Petite Sirah for Cabernet lovers. Drink now–2020.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Packed with red fruits, it shows structure and concentration. A mineral texture brings out the freshness of the fruit while also giving complexity. It could benefit from aging, so wait until the end of 2014.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Pineapple, candied apple and a touch of guava jelly on toast achieve great aromatic balance on a rare Rancho Santa Rosa Chardonnay. The flavors are lush, not racy, and evolve in a mellow fashion, from apple to nectarine and then papaya.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A pretty, tan-blush color, this refreshing wine was fermented in stainless steel. Flavors of peach and melon are in play, and the wine has excellent definition and length, with ample acidity and modest alcohol.",US-Washington-Pinot Gris

"With its perfumed aromas, this is a wine that has richness and sweetness, with soft velvet power.

This is a seductive wine, with a fine solid character.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Ripe and richly fruity, this fragrant Doublet family wine offers spice, floral aromas and a crisp texture. It is well balanced, lively and ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"Initially austere, this wine is driven by notes of bitter chocolate and lean fruit. The fruit weight promises some attractive aging, but for the present, it is firm, dry and solidly tannic.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The name indicates that this Champagne gets its delicate onion skin pink from the grape skins and not the addition of red wine, as with most rosé Champagnes. Does this make it any better? It's certainly a well integrated wine, the berry fruits very much part of the overall richness and, the acidity in a great supporting role.",France-Champagne-Pinot Noir

"This vineyard is in the Sebastopol Hills, one of the cooler parts of the valley. With a cool vintage, the wine feels a bit tough with prominent tannins and acidity. It's a balanced, elegant wine, however, with flavors of rhubarb, raspberry and heirloom tomato. Drink now–2016.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"As imposing as the athlete himself, this is an impressive wine from the get-go, high in acidity and the resulting bright cassis and red berry fruit.

"Made by Aaron Pott, this blend of 58% Merlot, 32% Cabernet Franc and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon is minerally and herbaceous, aged almost two years in French oak, half of it new, the rest seasoned. Cassis, pomegranate and peppercorn dance to the fore, supported by weighty tannins. Enjoy through 2020–2022.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is most interesting, layered with strawberry fruit, sweet straw and light tannins. It's deceptively light, yet elegant and able to sustain itself on through a compelling, structured finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Very dry, acidic and minerally, this is not one of those lush, decadent Chardonnays. It shows controlled flavors of citrus fruits, pears, wet stones and spices. The malolactic fermentation was prevented, giving it tangy acidity. Give it a try with shellfish and roast salmon.",US-California-Chardonnay

"The awesome nose of this wine is redolent with barbecue sauce, or perhaps a hickory-laced plum sauce, and it's incredibly distinctive if a little bizarre. The palate is full and rich with a similar saucy character, but also shows more complex notes of lush blackberries, rose hips and licorice.",US-California-Red Blend
"A fresh, fruit-forward style, this wine offers bold passion fruit and gooseberry flavors with just a hint of nectarine. It's not terribly complex, but the refreshing flavors linger nicely on the finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of brick dust, cheesy oak and black fruits battle to maintain clarity as this breathes. A sinewy mouthfeel is steered by high tartaric acidity, while flavors of vanilla, lactic oak, plum and currant are fresh and a bit tart. A medium-bodied, oaky tasting finish is driven by zesty acidity.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo

"This wine is quiet on the nose, with light touches of toasty resin and butter. It's Burgundian in feel, with plump, fleshy fruit that accompanies resiny, spicy flavors of white fruit and citrus. Notes of wood and resin dominate the finish on this chunky, full-bodied Viura (with 8% Malvasia).",Spain-Northern Spain-White Blend
"Standard for the variety, orange and honeyed aromas rest in front of a wide but tangy feeling palate with orange, nectarine and passion fruit controlling the flavor profile. On the finish, there's just enough acidic cut and weight for things to end nicely.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Torrontés
"Sweet and acidic, with strong gooseberry flavors that veer into ammonia.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"The winery held back this brut-style wine for eleven years.

"Attractive red fruits dominate this light and fruity wine. Good acidity and bright flavors are smoothed by wood, while the aftertaste brings back the fruit. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"From 70-year-old bush vines, this is excellent Maule Carignan. It has a brightness of fruit that puts the spotlight on cherry and raspberry, and while the color is a brilliant ruby it isn't overly dense, deep or heavy. There's a lightness of being to it, but also structure and acidity. Ageable for up to 5–8 years.",Chile-Maule Valley-Carignan

"Named after the family's grandfather, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot is still young, but quite delicious and elegant.

It has great potential for long aging.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a slightly riper approach from the longtime producer, with browned butter, vanilla, honeyed pineapple and a hint of seared marshmallow on the nose.

Turns simple in the middle palate, but is saved by a rich finish. A blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Merlot.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Oxidized stone fruit, flor, barrel lacquer and vanilla aromas are sharp but true for Manzanilla. A layered palate is lively and acidic, with nutty, creamy flavors of brined apricot. A rich-feeling finish is cut by zesty acidity, and as a whole this Sherry gets it right.",Spain-Andalucia-Sherry

"This 100% Cab will strike some cult Cabernet addicts as old-fashioned. It's  bone dry and firm in tannins, with an herb and olive tapenade taste to the riper currants and blackberries. Virtually guaranteed to age, this elegant young wine should be best between 2010 and 2016.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This full-bodied and beautifully flavored wine goes deep in terms of ripe fruit and subtle spices, and has a calm, composed character and ultrasmooth, slightly restrained texture. Delicious black-cherry and currant notes come out in the bouquet, weave through the palate and linger on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This rounded, yeasty wine features apple, bitter almond and some fruity acidity. It is full, rich and creamy-textured.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"Based on the old 100% Cabs from Inglewood that aged forever, Rubicon's interpretation has the same hard, tough tannins in youth. It's not a wine you want to drink anytime soon. Bursting with cherry, blackberry, plum and vanilla flavors, it has the elegant balance needed for ageability. Best after 2010, and should hold and improve for many years after.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe aromas of passionfruit, ruby red grapefruit and a juicy grass element show on the nose of this wine by Andres Ibarra and Caren Rideau. That ripeness tightens on the palate, with Granny Smith apple skins, yellow grapefruit juice and pressed green apples.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This opens with earthy aromas of game, underbrush and leather. The ripe palate offers dried cherry, fleshy raspberry, grilled sage, licorice and baking spice alongside bracing tannins.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"Aged in large wood barrels, this is a big, powerful wine with medicinal, herbal aromas and a polished feel. The dark plums and bitter coffee give a rich aftertaste. Age for 5–6 years.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Scents include white pepper, hints of herb, and in the mouth there is none of the usual bitter or dill pickle flavors. This was cold fermented and cofermented with 5% Viognier; then blended with 5% Grenache and 5% Mourvèdre. It's fruitier than the Walla Walla Valley bottling, and less earthy, but quite appealing.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Rounded and rich, this is full of strawberry flavors. It's deliciously ripe, with crispness to go with the serious fruit. This is very much a food rosé, concentrated and intense.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Simple and rustic but perfect for backyard grilling, this Zinfandel, Merlot and Carignane blend is robust, tannic and superripe in berry-cherry and spice flavors. Cries out for rich BBQ sauce.",US-California-Red Blend
"Sweet aromas of cherry, blueberry, cinnamon and nutmeg appear at first but slowly give way to more complex aromas of toasted almond, cola and cedar. You'll enjoy the smoothness and suppleness of this Merlot that would pair with milk-marinated pork or sweet barbecue baby back ribs.",Italy-Tuscany-Merlot
"Aromas of oak, asphalt, and ripe black fruits make for a lusty, modern nose. The feel is jammy and thick. Flavors of blackberry, chocolate and mocha give way to a strong oak component. A dense finish runs minty and chocolaty, with an emphasis on syrupy richness. Drink through 2021.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro
"Bosco Faiano is a hearty, masculine wine, aged 18 months in large oak casks to deliver dark notes of dried fruit, black currant, cured meat, leather and spice. At first, this tastes bold and raw, but after a few minutes in the glass, it shows a nice evolution toward elegance.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"Jorio is the kind of wine that should easily pair with pasta and meat. It shows a sophisticated softness, with concentration and natural intensity.",Italy-Central Italy-Montepulciano
"Quite dark in the glass, this meticulous blend of 47.32% Mourvèdre, 42.18% Syrah, 7.5% Petite Sirah and 3% Grenache shows rich, nose-tickling aromas of dried purple flowers, dark blueberry, caramelized blackberry and a touch of vanilla. The palate perfectly pairs dark fruit and bright acidity with touches of caramel and a tar-like structure. It's big, yet balanced.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend

"A simple, rustic Zinfandel, sweet and fruity in cherry jam, red licorice, bacon and spice flavors, wrapped into robust tannins. The grapes were sourced from Sonoma, Mendocino and Lodi.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Young, tannic and juicy, filled with sweet blackberry, cherry and cassis flavors, and well oaked, having been aged in 100% new French barrels. Those are the raw facts. The wine itself shows the pedigree of this fine estate, and will no doubt pick up bottle nuances over the years. But it seems to lack the precision of the great 2001, 2003 and 2004 vintages. Try after 2012.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"ots of briary, brambly wild berry and cherry fruit in this robust Zin. Also lots of mouthwatering spices. It's basically dry, but jammy sweet also, suggesting pairing with barbecue sauces made with sugar.",US-California-Zinfandel
"There's a touch of pungent apple skin at first, but the bouquet opens up over time with pretty floral tones and shadings of forest fruit and dried raspberry. For an Amarone, this wine is surprisingly bright and crisp on the close.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Bordeaux wine should not have high alcohol; it detracts from the play between fruit and tannins, as in this wine. It is powered by its extracted structure, with flavors of bitter chocolate that leave the fruit behind.",France-Bordeaux-Merlot
"A very good Merlot, representing a huge increase in quality over the 2008, and a return to the charms of the 2007. It's ripe and tasty in fruit, currants and sweet oak, and earns extra points for the fine structure. Ready now.",US-California-Merlot
"Spicy, lightly green aromas of bell pepper, olive and wild berry set up a strong-boned palate with pulse and overall balance. This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Merlot holds onto its aromas on the palate, which tastes of mint, green herbs, raspberry and currant. The finish is lightly herbal.",Chile-Maule Valley-Red Blend
"One of Schramsberg's younger releases, and made from all white grapes, this wine has tantalizing aromas of vanilla, apple and light toast that lead to layered and creamy flavors. A nice brisk balance with good acidity underlies the spice and fruit.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"With each new vintage of Cuvée Elena, the blend of grapes and vineyards grows more complex, the vines older, the flavors more compact and captivating. A sophisticated and penetrating mix of strawberry and raspberry preserves, highlights of herb and spice, a dash of clean earth, and a lingering and detailed finish make this a wine to savor immediately while tucking away a few bottles to watch it evolve.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"You'll need to swirl the glass a few times to release the enticing scents of yellow stone fruit, Alpine herb and an intriguing smoky note. The savory vibrant palate is more expressive, delivering layers of crunchy green apple, zesty tangerine and juicy yellow peach set against crisp acidity. A flinty mineral note graces the lingering finish, lending even more depth. Drink through 2020.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Kerner
"This is a very precise wine, steely and mineral. It has a smoky, flinty character that fits the image of an age-worthy Chablis. Under this texture lies the potential of delicious fruitiness, fresh and packed with sliced apple and quince flavors. Drink this wine from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This big-boned wine has smoke and brown-sugar aromas, ample and delicious raspberry and blackberry flavors, firm tannins, supportive acidity and a lingering finish. While full bodied, it's well balanced and will taste great with big proteins.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Charred and smells of coffee, toasted oak, minty berry fruit and earth. The palate is quite tannic, with creamy vanilla flavors along with candied berry fruit and lemony zest. Exhibits mostly faux oak and window dressing, but for $11 it isn't bad.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"From Canoe Ridge Vineyard, this delivers raspberry, herb, tire rubber and spice aromas and medium-bodied dark fruit flavors. The tannins are a bit dry and pasty.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Decadently rich in caramel and vanilla on the nose, this vineyard-designate evolves into more delicate floral elements, with a depth of spicy oak and baked apple and pear. Throughout the medium body and medium acidity is a freshness of lemon and lime, with a slight twist of tangerine.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Still firm in tannins, this has developed into an austere and dark wine. It is serious and solid, with a firm, brooding character and layers of acidity as well as black currant fruits. It is probably ready to drink now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Equal parts Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this is a powerfully rich wine based on the 1998 and 1997 vintage. It is full, packed with citrus, peach and apricot flavors mingling with a beautiful, generous creamy texture. This is a glorious Champagne, a worthy homage to Louis Tarlant who pioneered the family's Champagne in the early 20th century.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This mango-flavored wine is ripe, generous and fruity. Its richness and spice are right up front. It is a gorgeous wine, smooth, creamy and ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"Vanilla and caramel show right away on the nose of this bottling, followed by stewed blackberry and black plum sauce, proving quite jammy but layered with burnt sugar aromas. Blackberry pie in a vanilla crust is the flavor that pops on the palate, along with black plum and all manner of purple fruit and flower.",US-California-Merlot
"From the home vineyards of the Saget family, this a warm and generous wine. While endowed with many green Sauvignon Blanc characteristics, the tropical fruit style makes it feel rich. As it ages, it will offer even more complex flavors. Drink from 2015.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Sourced from the Stanly Ranch Vineyard, among other sites, this 100% varietal wine is light pink-orange in hue, and citrus-driven in flavor. Cherry and strawberry notes complement the lemon and grapefruit, delivering a refreshingly lengthy zip of acidity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Yeasty bread notes mingle with preserved cherry and raspberry tones on this dry, but fruity, Pinot Noir sparkling. It's quite bold on the palate with big, mouthfilling foam, and finishes with a touch of mushroom.",US-New York-Pinot Noir
"Made with organically grown grapes and refermented in the bottle on its lees, this features aromas of honeysuckle, almond and ripe apple. The dry palate delivers yellow peach, tart green apple and nectarine zest alongside sharp acidity.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Ripe fruit, blackberry, cherry liqueur and cinnamon characterize this hearty red. It finishes with notes of tobacco, plum and exotic spice.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Lagrein
"This is a current release from Joe Davis, who holds his wines back until their prime. Hailing from Ballard Canyon, it shows black plum, pressed purple flowers, tanned leather and balsamic notes on the nose. There's a pleasantly yet softly structured texture to the palate, where dried blackberry, roast beef, lilac and Concord grape flavors arise.",US-California-Syrah
"This is one of the producer's deepest value propositions, a well-made, robustly approachable and accessible wine made from 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, 7% Malbec, 3% Syrah, 2% Petit Verdot and 1% Cabernet Franc. Soft and firmly integrated, it's perfumed and floral, with layers of dark cherry and tobacco that evolve with grace in the glass.",US-California-Claret
"Stalky smelling, with a minerally streak. Feels tangy and lean, with lemon, sour apple and white currant flavors. Short on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Viura
"Dry, spicy, woody, earthy berry aromas are common for Rioja. This is bouncy and full of tomato-like acidity, while favors of tobacco, reedy berry fruits and spice are a touch green in the middle. On the finish, this is rough but true to the vintage, which was notoriously cold, wet and difficult.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Brilliant and luminous, this tasty Picolit offers pretty golden highlights and aromas of citrus zest, almond, honey and cola. It exhibits a traditional, elegant style and ends with bright,  refreshing notes of acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Picolit
"Right now this speaks of earth, forest floor and oak leaf—but not in a mature way. This Pinot takes time to show the glorious red cherry that is there in abundance, caressed by gentle, smoky oak. This will take time to blossom but will reward patience. Balance between acidity and silken body is evident and the layers of leaf, earth, cherry, smoke and minerality will continue in their infinite Pinot alchemy. Drink as of 2016.",Austria-Thermenregion-Pinot Noir
"Sweet in apricots and vanilla, sharp in minty, catty aromas and tastes, this white blend can best be described as rustic.",US-California-White Blend
"Tri is actually a blend of four grapes – Syrah, Dolcetto, Cabernet Sauvignon and Mourvèdre. Maybe should be renamed Quad? It's soft and fruity, and the unusual mix of grapes resolves into an easy-drinking, all-purpose, but somewhat diffuse, generic red.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"97-99 Barrel sample. A tasting from several barrels, because the chateau has not made the final blend, so the rating is provisional. But the wine is so rich, with an almost perfect balance of acidity and ripeness, allied to a complete purity of honeyed botrytis. However the final wine turns out, it will be magnificent.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Aromas of coconut, espresso and spiced plum steeped in spirits lead the nose on this full-bodied red. The bold palate delivers oak extract, dried black cherry, sweet vanilla and roasted coffee bean, with bracing tannins.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"Light-bodied, lean and very refreshing, this lively, crisp wine will make a great counterpoint to lots of appetizers and many kinds of seafood. A tangy apple and peach-skin flavor is mild but tasty, and the finish is crisp and clean.",US-California-Albariño
"Made in the popular modern style, this is a particular success. It shows ultraconcentrated orange, apricot, green apple and peach flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture, and a strong coating of oak brings layers of butterscotch, buttered toast and vanilla. This richness would be excessive without the minerality and acidity that Sonoma Mountain brings. Don't drink this too cold.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The vintage was a good one for Sequum, which is assembling an impressive track record. The wine is dry and tannic, yet wonderfully forward in blackberries and black currants, and the oak application is perfect. Give it until 2020 or so in the cellar.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A huge wine, explosive in ripe fruit, elaborated with rich oak and wrapped into smooth, sweet tannins. Made from vineyards throughout the county, it dazzles with a complex of blackberry jam, mocha, date, bacon and smoky sandalwood flavors. Really impressive, especially at this price.

The core is dry, solid, showing wood, finishing with vivid minerality and acidity.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Oaky in flavor and broad in mouthfeel, this wine has plenty of butter, wood-smoke and toasted-nut aromas followed by ripe pear and butter on the palate. It is full bodied and has a touch of astringency on the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A bone-dry, refreshing rosé, with tight acidity and crisp red berry and apple flavors. Classic summertime wine. Screwcap.",Austria-Burgenland-Blaufränkisch
"The deep color of this wine prefigures its dark aromas, which are redolent of black mission fig cake, chocolate and cigar box. The medium-full palate feels expansive, and it's structured with fine, mouth-coating tannins that carry onto the textured finish.",US-Virginia-Cabernet Franc
"A bit rough and hot, this Syrah has very ripe blackberry, cherry, licorice and Asian spice flavors. Drink it with easy fare, like pizza or burgers.",US-California-Syrah
"Lots of dynamics play on the nose of this wine, from chamomile flowers and daffodils to chalk, pink lemonade, cotton candy and tropical fruits. The palate is framed by a tense minerality, seasoned with flavors of lemonade, browned butter and guava.",US-California-Chardonnay
"There's a reductive element to the nose of this wine, indicating the powerful nature of the vintage but also the wine's youth. Let it open to unveil an intensity of baked apple and white peach, along with heartier highlights of crème brûlée and vanilla toast. With a medium body and length, it has enough acidity to remain vibrant. It's sourced from a who's who of the region's vineyards.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Solid to start out, with mostly clean, fresh berry aromas and some medicinality. The palate is snappy, juicy and clean, with black cherry, plum and berry flavors. Forward on the finish, and composed for what is essentially a standard Malbec.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This is a surprisingly powerful wine, with (for a Beaujolais) a high alcohol. Densely textured, the wine is concentrated and dark with plenty of acidity as well as strawberry fruits. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Nicely balanced and full of satisfying cherry flavors, this full-bodied wine has a top note like slices of grilled baguette. Bright cranberry and hints of baking spices round out its personality. Best cellar it until at least 2017.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A brilliant gold color in the glass, this opens with rich aromas of grilled apple, buttered toast, ripe melon and a touch of honey. The round, lush texture is balanced by lifting acidity, which also keeps the ripe stone fruit and sweet spice flavors clean and lifted on the lingering finish. Drink now–2016.",South Africa-Coastal Region-Chenin Blanc
"This is a soft, lush Chardonnay, with ripe, jammy apricot, orange, mango and honey flavors, accented with buttered toast and vanilla. It's a satisfying Chardonnay at one of the better prices out there.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Ripe and full-bodied, this immense wine has rich layers of tropical fruits. The wine, like so often in Corton-Charlemagne, is a powerful, huge expression of Chardonnay. It does have balance from acidity. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Citrus acidity and raspberry fruit combine in this ripe, sun-drenched wine. It has a fine balance of crispness, with rich fruits and a delicate lemon note on the finish.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Toast, espresso and mocha aromas lead the nose while the bracing palate offers raw red berry, anise, coffee and a hint of chocolate. Grainy tannins provide firm support but leave an astringent finish. Wait another few years for the tannins to soften a bit then drink up.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This is a great example of Pinot Noir made in the slightly underripe style, showing underbrush, kalamata olive, black olive, black pepper and a touch of just-ripe mulberry on the nose. Those elements carry through the fresh sip, where intriguing notes of thyme, marjoram and bay leaf decorate the tart red-fruit and olive character.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is yet another dense, powerful single-vineyard wine from Artadi. The palate is pure silk and very ripe. Saturated blackberry, boysenberry, toast, chocolate and herbal flavors finish plump and smooth. This delicious, unctuous heavyweight from a hot year is made for early consumption; drink through 2019.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Herbal fynbos, sweet grass and lime leaf aromas are upfront on the nose of this wine, followed by supporting notes of Anjou pear, honeydew rind and honeysuckle. It's attractive and easy drinking, with refreshing citrus and green apple flavors that finish crisp and clean. Drink now.",South Africa-Western Cape-Chenin Blanc
"A sweaty nose obscures light strawberry flavors. Yeasty and thin, it's best used as a mixer.",US-Oregon-Sparkling Blend
"The wine is rich, bringing together two great white grapes. Both give the ripe smooth texture, while the Alvarinho also brings in its crisper charms. Pear and green-plum flavors dominate this intense and concentrated wine. Drink from late 2017.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese White
"This wine comes from the joint venture between Quinta de la Rosa and winemaker Jorge Moreira. It is ripe yet crisp in acidity, with smooth vanilla and rich apple, citrus and spice flavors. The wine is developing still and will be ready from 2017.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"From the famed vineyard named for the colorful author, this wine remains a standout for the producer, and a tremendous deal for the quality. It exudes notes of eucalyptus on the nose, before unveiling big-boned but balanced tannins, with leather and cranberry notes meeting a tensile line of minerality. It finishes with a taste of mocha.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"At the age of nearly six years, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend remains deliciously fresh, offering ripe blackberry, cherry, currant, chocolate and oak flavors. It's soft in tannins, which limits ageability, although it's already throwing some sediment. Drink over the next two years.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a fruit-driven, sharp and Port-like red wine, blended from Petit Verdot, Malbec, Grenache and Nebbiolo.",US-California-Red Blend
"Briny, cool-coast aromas of pinched plum and berry lead to a full-bodied palate bolstered by high acidity. Tart plum, cherry and herbal flavors finish crisp, short and basic. This is a good, standard Pinot Noir, nothing more or less.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Pinot Noir
"Big-time tannins make this blend of all five classic Bordeaux varieties tight in character. Underneath the astringency are intense flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants that are liberally oaked. Dry and refined, the wine will develop bottle complexity after 2018.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a sweet Pinot Gris that is honeyed and very rich. Light spice notes are buoyed by explosive apricot and pineapple flavors, yielding a wine that's great for capping off a meal.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"This is the best of Cru's 2010 Pinot Noirs, and it shows real Santa Lucia complexity. It's a dry wine, with brisk acids and supple tannins. It has a flashy core of cherry, red currant, licorice and smoky, sweet sandalwood flavors. Drink this over the next 2–3 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Fermented in a 500-liter French oak puncheon and put through full malo, this stands in stark contrast to the winery's Her Silhouette Chardonnay. Both are exceptional, yet this is rounder, fuller and more elegant, with crisp apple and pear fruit accented with cinnamon spice.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Light, minerally and fresh smelling, with a note of lime and cured ham. Feels and tastes like pure citrus, with hits of pear, honeydew and ripe apple poking through. Juicy and fresh stuff.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo

"A blend that includes Merlot, this wine is ripe while also structured. The tannins go along with the black fruits and acidity. It has a crisp, juicy finish that makes it ready to drink now.",Portugal-Bairrada-Portuguese Red
"This is a balanced blend of Rabo de Ovelha and Roupeiro grapes. They give the wine both its crisp acidity and its ripe white-fruit flavors. The acidity and the texture suggest the wine should age for a few more months, so drink from late 2017.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese White
"A delicate floral fragrance of white flower, pear, citrus, hay and a hint of beeswax and Mediterranean herb lead the nose. The palate is polished and bright, showing green apple, citrus and mineral alongside fresh acidity.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"Aromas suggesting tilled soil, sage and black-skinned fruit come together in the glass. On the firm palate, close-grained tannins support mature black plum, clove and a touch of star anise. Drink through 2020.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"Here's a stunning sparkling wine made in the classic method, with no added dosage. It offers citrus, melon, apple, stone fruit, minerality and walnut notes. The creamy palate is supported by crisp freshness and finishes bone-dry.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Chardonnay

"Give this Pinot credit for its rich, ripe cherry pie, red licorice, cola and baking spice flavors, which are savory and delicious. It's a bit one-dimensional, and doesn't seem like an ager, but it does show the elegance of the Santa Lucia Highlands.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A great value wine that's ready to drink now. This vibrant and aromatic selection boasts scents of orange blossom, white peach and fresh honeydew. The palate is fresh and lively with a crisp and mouthwatering finish.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Chenin Blanc
"Intensely generous in toffee and buttered caramel, this wine veers into a perception of sweetness, held up by a thick presence of oak. Medium bodied, it tastes heavier than expected.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This Cabernet was made to be consumed as a dessert wine. It's soft, simple and very sweet, with white sugar and cherry jam flavors.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Celebrates its lusty volume proudly as a big, gutsy Zinfandel that makes no apology for high alcohol and extract. The flavors are huge, of ripe blackberries, loganberries, mulberries, red licorice, figs, black olives, Asian spices and oak, but despite all that, the wine finishes fully dry and balanced. Drink now through 2010.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Tremendously rich and ripe, this Pinot just dazzles the palate with waves of raspberries, cherries, cocoa, red licorice, bacon and other intense umami flavors. It's dry and silky, but the drawback is excessive softness.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Ripe berry aromas intermingle with toast and maple notes on the nose of this saturated, tannic blend of Granacha, Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon. Flavors of black plum, tomato, spice and herbs hint at Priorat's famous schisty soils, while this expands on an aggressive finish. Drink through 2023.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"The Stoneleigh style traditionally favors ripeness over herbaceousness, and the 2008 holds true to form, offering up grapefruit and nectarine aromas and an appealing blend of citrus and stone-fruit flavors. It's plump and round, yet finishes fresh. Good as an apéritif or with light dishes.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc

"Refreshing and simple, this is dryish and spicy, with orange, apricot and peach flavors all accented with crisp acidity. It's easy to drink as a cocktail sipper, with little snacks, like tempura or cheesy puff pastries.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"Here's a very tight, young Pinot, one you'll want to put some bottle age on. It's marked by acids and oak flavors that have not yet been integrated into the underlying fruit. Give it through 2008, by which time the smoky wood and vanilla should marry with the cherries and Dr. Pepper flavors to produce a rich, complex sipper.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Pinot Gris is a fast-rising grape in Washington, but most plantings are young, and prone to being a bit over-cropped. Whatever the case, this is sharp and acidic and does not have the concentration of fruit it needs. Green apples and celery flavors lead into a short, sharp finish.",US-Washington-Pinot Gris
"The rubbery plum aromas are sweet and medicinal, and the palate feels creamy, thick and chewy. This tastes sweet and lightly herbal, with baking spice and jammy black-fruit flavors and a mild green element. The finish is a touch chunky.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A ripe, rounded wine, with intense flavors of apple skins, pear and white peach, with just a hint of nut. Described as dry, this has some richness to balance the definite acidity, which gives a lift but certainly no hardness.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"Less immediately accessible than the 2005, the 2006 is tight and tart and almost seems encased in some sort of a shell. The fruit is concentrated raspberry and plum, and the acids taste natural while the tannins are polished and proportionate. The wine stays focused and strong through a very long finish that dapples in toasted coconut and chocolate malt. If you are a Rollat collector (and you should be) this would be the wine to cellar for five or six years, waiting for the Edouard to come into full flower.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dry Creek produced this wine and then held it back all of this time to let it properly mellow. It's beautiful—softly lush, dry and complex in jammy blackberry and cherry fruit, with a spicy, briary character that makes it savory.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A wine launched to celebrate the foundation of Krems (Chremisa) in 995, this full-bodied, rich wine is packed with tropical fruits, just a touch of spice and a rounded texture. Flavors are of pineapple, mango, apricots and melon. The ripe acidity gives a great finishing lift.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"A useful wine, made in the lush, mellow way that many Americans like their Pinot Grigio. It's clean in acidity, with pleasant citrus, tropical fruit, green grass and vanilla flavors.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"Site speaks loudly in this beautifully made wine that is allowed to show its naturally inclined power within a constraint of cool-climate terroir. Juicy and explosive on the palate in cherry, raspberry, forest floor and jolts of cardamom, it's both lush and toasty, with a firmness to the tannin structure that suggests plenty of aging potential. It should get pretty interesting between 2024 and 2034, if one can possibly wait.",US-California-Pinot Noir

A pleasant grassy tone gives interest to the finish, while ample acidity keeps the palate fresh and clean. Drink now.",South Africa-Western Cape-Sauvignon Blanc
"Leathery animal notes blend with stalky berry and plum aromas in front of a bumpy palate with hard tannins. This tastes of herbal plum and berry, with a mildly green, oaky accent. That same oaky, green action repeats on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Shows a slightly evolved color for a wine this young, with hints of brick already creeping in at the rim, but it also delivers elegant sous bois aromas, bright cherry and cranberry fruit and notes of scorched wood and leather that turn more mocha-like on the finish. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir

"Delicate and poised, this unusual Pinot Gris was fermented half in stainless and half in neutral oak, then kept on the lees for an extended period before bottling. The wine reveals itself gracefully with mixed green apple and white peach; hints of baking spice and a wash of vanilla wafer appear right at the finish line.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris

The palate is dark in flavor, with black plum, charcoal, black pepper, prune, dried wisteria and other purple flowers, all presented on a very soft mouthfeel.",US-California-Syrah
"This Rhone-inspired specialist, who also does a fine job with Zin, shows both sides of the coin in this Rhône variety that in California is more often associated and blended with Zin. Elusive red berry takes on layers of flavors in the glass, becoming densely mouth-coating and intensely rich on the leathery finish.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Mature for Cariñena, but it's still a hard wine with juniper and other narrow aromas. The palate is almost sour, with tight tannins and noticeable astringency.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"Simple but well made Sauvignon, it offers delicate aromas of tropical fruit. The round palate is more expressive, with subtle white peach and cantaloupe alongside fresh acidity. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon

It will be ready to drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of red berry and balsamic herbs provide the focus of this vibrant and easy-going wine made entirely with Sangiovese.

Wine4All, Specialty Wine.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Old vines and low yields have concentrated this wine wonderfully. It is the essence of the stony, chalk and clay soil, powerfully driven by its dark fruits and immense tannins. New wood aging has added spice and has also begun the process of rounding out this impressive wine. It still needs to age and shouldn't be touched before 2018.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"This mellow, moderately fruity wine has berry and wet-earth aromas, mild strawberry and spice flavors and a soft texture.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Ripe and juicy, and overall quite tasty. It begins with a lot of red fruit, and in the mouth it's more of the same with no rough edges. It's a seamless Chianti, a sure hit in the trattorias. And there's nothing wrong with the smooth raspberry finish that features some creamy vanilla oak.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese

"Made with a blend of 50% Trebbiano and 50% Malvasia, this delivers aromas of Tuscan almond cookies, citrus and dried apricot. The concentrated palate offers layers of candied nectarine zest, fig and toasted almond. Pair it with seasoned cheeses or cantucci.",Italy-Tuscany-White Blend

"Ripe Mirabelle plums and tart, red apples mix to give a very fruity, appetizing aspect which on the palate is joined by ripe, lemony freshness.

Lovely Mirabelle finish of immense length. Drink 2016–2026.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Almost tropical overtones on the nose announce ample pure fruit. Russet pear has both a touch of fresh Amalfi lemon and luscious honey. Yet the palate is slender, taut and dry. A lovely evocation of the varietal richness of Pinot Gris, framed on very light feet with elegance and poise. Totally appetizing, dry and moreish.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"No kidding that this was aged in oak (Criado en Roble). It smells charred and toasty, with resiny aromas thrown in. A full, seemingly healthy palate can handle the high level of wood this has, but, in the end, oak is mostly what this tastes like. A dry spicy tannic finish doesn't break the chain.",Uruguay-Canelones-Tannat
"Smells and tastes overoaked, with toothpicky vanilla and smoky char notes. The amount of new French wood was 50%. The jammy raspberry, cherry and currant fruit just isn't intense or complex enough to support all that weight. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This reserve-level Cabernet—made from grapes sourced partly from 35-year-old vines—is lovely in its wealth of detail.

"Sharp in raisin skin bitterness, this dry, dull wine has overripe cherry flavors, and is quite tannic. Lacks opulence and interest.",US-California-Mourvèdre
"There's a tug of unripeness that shows up in this Pinot Noir, like a cross of mushrooms, green herbs and asparagus.

Drink it now after a few minutes of chilling in the fridge.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Shiny pink in color, with a crisp and wet nose that powerfully suggests refreshment to come. Juicy and superfresh on the palate, with cherry and raspberry flavors and citrusy undertones. A real winner in Garnacha rosé from Navarra.",Spain-Northern Spain-Rosé
"Red cherries, dark spices of clove and anise and gingerbread show on the nose of this wine from the Foley family portfolio. Darkness pervades the concentrated palate, with black fruits, dark chocolate, beef char and condensed purple flowers. It's so deep that it lacks noticeable flavor layers.",US-California-Merlot
"Right on the heels of their excellent 2014 version, this ups the ante still further. Young and forward, it's nonetheless well-balanced and ready for prime-time drinking. Bright raspberry and cherry fruit abounds, with the freshness and supporting acidity to age nicely for up to a decade.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Crisp and dry, this is a medium-bodied, slightly austere wine. Hints of smoke or stuck flint join with grapefruit rind on the nose, while a slightly bitter note appears on the palate and persists through the finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine has a light color and appealing notes of candied strawberries, herbs, brown stems and forest floor. It's light and airy—surprising given the general power of the vintage—with delicate, mouthwatering fruit flavors.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Made mainly with Syrah, this wine's flavors are potent in blackberries, cherries, black pepper and smoky, salty meats. The tannins are big, but negotiable. Feels rustic and hot, and at its best now.",US-California-G-S-M
"The barrel toast carries a lightly charred edge, while the strawberry fruit comes up front and center with flavors of sweet pastry. There's a lick of licorice running through it as well, and the overall structure suggests drinking it up now through 2020.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Minty, scratchy aromas of cherry and berry air out well. This feels chewy yet fresh in the mouth, with plum and cherry flavors matched by good overall intensity and balance. A controlled finish tastes dusty and loamy; drink through 2017.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend

"Fruity and crisp, this bright wine offers flavors of lemon and fresh apple juice. A tangy lemon-zest texture gives great acidity and a refreshing aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This is a jammy, dense and pure Cabernet, with meat and berry aromas that mix in touches of graphite and chocolate. It feels a little hard and acidic despite its size, while the flavor profile is of mossy berry fruit and chocolate. Tight and nervy, this offers lots of acidic push on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a spicy, softly lush offering of Cabernet sourced from a tiny part of the Larkmead Vineyard in northern Napa Valley. Black and red currant play off one another well, before revealing subtle layers of dried herb and tobacco leaf, the finish as cushy as the opening and midpalate of the wine.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
This simple white opens with scents of honeysuckle and ripe orchard fruit while the easygoing palate offers hints of nectarine and green apple. Fresh acidity gives it a brisk finish.,Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Many are now playing with the low-alcohol, nervy side of Chardonnay, but Doug Margerum succeeds more than most. This bottling is light in the glass, with clean and crisp Asian pear, nectarine and mandarin pith aromas. The palate is tightly wound and energetic, showing sharp citrus and rounded strone-fruit flavors. Drink now–2030.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A rich mix of red, blue and black fruit opens into a sappy, spicy midpalate. The lush fruits are highlighted by a wash of milk chocolate. At first tightly wound, the wine seems to show more oak flavors with air, hinting at licorice and Bourbon barrel.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This bottling from Syrah legend Bob Lindquist, sourced from the biodynamic vineyard that he planted, delivers snappy boysenberry, white pepper, rosemary and lavender aromas. The palate judiciously balances savory, peppery spice and lush purple floral notes with tangy black plum fruit and rosehip accents, making for a wondrous sip.",US-California-Syrah
"The northern Rhône is inspiration for this Syrah. It's a dark, tannic wine, richly acidic, with complex, fascinating flavors of blackberries, smoked meat, cassis, cedar wood and black pepper. You get plenty of bang for your buck with this dry, elegant wine.",US-California-Syrah
"Smells like pink bubblegum, tastes like sugary cherry pie filling. Even at this price, it's not a bargain.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Rich raspberry, cherry and mocha flavors characterize this Grenache, but the mouthfeel is off-balance, with its acids and green tannins sticking out. This exposes the difficulties of making great Grenache in California, even in the Santa Ynez Valley.",US-California-Grenache
"Exhibiting the roundness of the vintage, this is rich and soft. With notes of almond, yeast and yellow fruit, this is already maturing into a bold, open wine. Ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Lithe and nicely balanced, this flavorful wine shows a red berry-herb bouquet and a pleasingly dry, gently spicy palate. The mouthfeel is good, and shows some texture despite the fact that it's light-weight on the palate. An interesting chalk note comes in on the back end of this pleasant, easy-drinking surprise.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This light-footed Sauvy is opens with attractive aromas of green melon, fresh-cut grass and lime leaf. The palate is bright and refreshing, with zippy acidity and a mouthwatering finish. Drink now.",South Africa-Western Cape-Sauvignon Blanc
Ripe and textured notions of russet pear take center stage with this wine. The nose already signals at the generous fruitiness and the palate is pervaded with fresh poised juicy fruit. A touch of residual carbon dioxide adds liveliness alongside lemony brightness. The finish is dry and utterly moreish with its fruit-centered joy.,France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"This vineyard-designated wine reflects its sense of place remarkably well, offering tight dark cherry and blueberry around a strong character of wild earth, tea and herb. High in acidity and minerality, and yet powerfully understated, it's gorgeously drinkable now but will gain further complexity through 2022.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Pickle barrel scents and a strong impression of green wood, along with a whiff of cedar, characterize this rough, rustic, tannic wine. The 2007 is the current release and is drying out quickly. Drink up.",US-Oregon-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This rich selection has a touch of bottle age that creates a toasty character. It features ripe apricot and peach notes, with warm and taut acidity. Ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"With its layers of toast and ripe green and yellow fruits, this is both a warm and a structured wine. It has richness and a hint of vanilla, and the most tangy orange zest. The acidity at the end is intense but very refreshing. Age for at least four years.",France-France Other-Chardonnay
"Early on, this smells young and a lot like latex mixed with candied plum and red-berry fruits; give it time and it settles on jammy red-fruit aromas as well as a wide-bodied palate. Plum, cherry and raspberry flavors all vie for attention, while the finish is fresh, fruity and lively. Drink through 2017.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"An underpinning of soft, grippy tannin carries lingering red currant and cranberry flavors in this full-bodied, unabashedly ripe reserve-level wine. Cola and leathery earth notes combine to boost and contrast the fruit, which persists long into the finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Floral scents float above a chunky, cherry-fruited, single-vineyard wine. It's quite refreshing, with appealing texture and underlying minerality that compensates for the overall impression of palate lightness. Drink now through 2018, while the freshness remains at its peak.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A bright nose with green apple and citric aromas comes with mild oak. This is acidic and racy in composition, with roundness along the edges of the palate. Apple and nectarine flavors are lightly oaked and salty, while this holds form on a high-acid finish.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Chardonnay
"Peppery herbal notes populate the nose, leading into flavors of brambly red fruits. The wine gathers strength on the midpalate, finishing with a flourish of strawberry preserves. There's a touch of rhubarb pie and a dusting of cocoa in the mix as well, and for an Oregon Pinot Noir made in such quantities (more than 10,000 cases) it offers exceptional depth and density.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Early tobacco and mint aromas quickly yield to mossy black fruit, and in the mouth it's fresh and zesty, with mild green-pepper infused plum and cassis flavors. Quite crisp and lean, with herbal influences showing up at all points. Classic Navarran red wine.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Acidity and bitterness mark blackberry and raisin flavors in this wine, along with a hit of oak and tannins. It's already throwing some sediment and isn't likely to be an ager.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"In the range of what Clos Troteligotte calls micro-parcels, this is in the middle. It's full of generous black fruits and attendant acidity. At the same time, it is young and still coming together. The future promises great concentration and depth of flavor. Drink from 2017.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Properly opulent, this is a generous, subtly wood-aged wine. Ripe apricot and peach fruits are shot through with crisp apple. The wood and the rich fruits give this structured wine a warm character. It is still young, of course. Drink from 2023.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This full-bodied white is grand but not showy, dry but not austere. It combines intriguing and subtle aromas and flavors resembling grilled baguette, toasted almonds, vanilla, fig and white peach. It should pair well with mushrooms, poultry and veal.",US-California-Viognier

"This wine is well sourced, its grapes coming from Brown Ranch, Toyon and Trefethen, among other sites. Aging takes place partially in barrels that have been soaked in water before toasting to lessen the impact, and in stainless steel. Light, crisp honeyed apple, pear and vanilla star alongside caramel and a floral flourish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"All varietal, this wine is a blend of fruit from top sites Ciel du Cheval, Conner Lee, Obelisco and Stonetree. The aromas are quite reserved, with notes of barrel spice that are followed by full-bodied fruit flavors with a spicy finish. It drinks well but the variety seems lost.",US-Washington-Merlot
"This makes a nice change from the simply fruity norm. The color is a traditional light garnet with a bronze rim, while the aromas resemble rhubarb and raspberries. Flavors are earthy, savory and meaty rather than straightforward grapy. The texture is rather soft, the tannins muted and the body not too full.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Maple, brown sugar, caramel and cinnamon powder aromas portend sweetness. In the mouth, this is fairly heavy and syrupy, with moderate acidity. Caramel and mushroom flavors finish fragmented but with potency.",Spain-Andalucia-Sherry
"Still firmly tannic, this impressive wine is still developing. Made from old vines that give minerality and concentration, it is very dense allowing some juicy black plum flavors to show through. With its dry tannins, it's going to need more aging. Drink from 2017.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This wine impresses from first pop, a complicated, well-crafted exploration of full-bodied flavor and brambly beauty. Blueberry pie, violet and cigar tease the nose as they follow through on a soft, supple layering of fine-tuned texture. But it's the stony minerality and undeniable coaxing of white pepper that imprint the memory. This wine should only get better through 2034.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"New-wood spice dominates the aroma of this wine, given weight by the rich black plum fruits and concentrated acidity. With its big structure and equally big fruits, this is an impressive wine for long aging. Drink from 2022.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The nose is shy and does not want to show its fruit. The very frothy, light palate displays hints of ripe yellow apple and glints of citrus. This is balanced and shows its fruit reluctantly but comes together beautifully on the dry finish.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"Snappy, chiseled and defined by fresh grass and citrus aromas on the nose, this is textbook Casablanca SB. Flavors of tarragon, sage, lime and citrus peel finish with a lasting wave of mild pyrazinic bitterness and tangy citrus.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc

"Rustic and a little sweet tasting, this has flavors of cherry pie, red currant and toast. Drink it with cheeseburgers.",US-California-Red Blend

"This is a spicy wine, soft and open. Its tannins and red berry fruits have a diffuse character that takes away the focus of the wine. It will age quickly.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Purple flowers, ripe berry and tobacco aromas lead the nose on this Sangiovese-based wine. On the smooth, concentrated palate, notes of black pepper, anise and clove accent the core of fleshy black cherry. Velvety tannins provide support. Drink 2016–2020.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Petit Verdot coming from the cool 2011 vintage, this wine leans into the savory with notes of leafy herbs, cherry, raspberries and woodspice. The supple, textured, dazzling mouthfeel is the star of this show, with elegance and deftness leading to an exceptionally long finish.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Toasty, warm, lusty dark-berry aromas are laced with a subtle animal accent. This is a big wine, with a fleshy, tannic, muscular feel. Flavors of blackberry, mocha and chocolate finish in fine form, with moderate tannic grip and all sorts of length. Drink this excellent Toro through 2022.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro
"Condensed and dark on the bouquet, with initial hard, cheesy aromas giving way to herbal berry scents that suggest thyme and rosemary. The palate is soft and chubby, with just enough structure to make the earthy, ripe berry flavors taste better than simply big and bulky. Finishes with a light espresso bitterness. Drink now through 2012.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Blended from eight separate vineyards, this appellation wine doesn't hold back on quality. It offers a seamless, integrated foundation of juicy cherry, cranberry and orange flavors, dusted with cardamom spice.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"An elegant Rioja made in a more traditional style. The nose is a little baked and raisiny, with additional aromas of caramel and leather. The palate is where this wine shines: the feel is elegant and smooth, while the cherry and raspberry flavors are subtle and a little bit tangy. Mature and sexy stuff; more classic than modern, but not 100% old-school.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Icarus, in Greek myth, got too close to the sun. So did this wine from Icaria. It's not bad, but simply overripe. Has a sweet taste of raisins, in addition to the sweet smokiness from oak. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is aromatic and enchanting, loaded with very pretty scents of citrus blossom and lime. The fruit blends sweet apple, lemon/lime and juicy white peach. It's a luscious Chardonnay that relies on the perfectly ripened fruit to deliver the flavors, and succeeds beautifully. All Dijon clones, with a splash of Viognier lifting up the nose.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay

"One of the most exciting white wine varieties to emerge from Italy in the past five years, Pecorino delivers a sturdy, creamy mouthfeel backed by intense aromas of apricot, butterscotch, candied orange peel and fragrant yellow rose. Pair it with pasta, white meats or shellfish.",Italy-Central Italy-Pecorino

"Aromas suggesting forest floor, ripe berry, leather, scorched earth and a hint of cured meat slowly emerge on this full-bodied red.

"This white is overtaken by alcohol, giving it a sharp taste of weight and oak over slight wafts of sour apple and honey.",US-California-Pinot Blanc
"This Riesling's fruit is from a 70-year-old Eden Valley vineyard; half the wine was vinified by Jeff Grosset at Polish Hill, the other half was vinified by Rob Hill Smith at Yalumba. Once the wine was all brought together, Grosset and Hill-Smith, as the story goes, took four days to decide on the final blend. The wine's at once viscous and very dry, with stone fruit, vanilla bean and some floral flavors. Green apple rounds out the long, dry finsih.",Australia-South Australia-Riesling

Savory notes of bacon and spice add complexity to plum-like fruit, while the tannins are supple—the structure here is acid-based, not reliant on heavy extraction.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Rich style of wine, its lime and mineral character enveloped by the ripe peach flavors. It's a beautiful wine, forward and ready to drink over the next year.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Wiry aromas of berry and spice are tempered by a touch of oaky vanilla.

Snappy acidity makes for a moderately sharp, pointed finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
