"This best-of-barrels reserve shows a richness and complexity that make for compelling drinking. A mixture of several clones and selections of Pinot Noir, the wine has firm tannins, but the burst of cherries, red currants, root beer and sweet smoky oak gives it a supple, mouth-filling quality. Delicious now with decanting, and should hold and improve through 2012.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"In hommage to the man who pioneered the use of oak to ferment Sauvignon Blanc, this wood-fermented and matured wine is only produced in the best years. It is rich and just toasty, but equally about the structured mineral texture and ripe citrus. It is a wine to age, so drink from 2018.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"This sees less new oak than the Jones Block, so the quality of the biodynamically grown fruit shines. Herbal notes reminiscent of rosemary and thyme accent raspberry and cherry fruit, and while there's ample weight and ripeness, the overall impression is of drinkability and ease.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
"A savory nose with hints of balsamic and smoke, balanced by cassis and cedar, start this wine out right. In the mouth, it's complex and assertive, with flavors of anise, spice and plum. Pronounced tannins need some time to age, but overall the wine is excellent now.",South Africa-Stellenbosch:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

Imported by Vias Imports.",Italy-Tuscany:Cabernet Sauvignon

"This unusual blend of grapes from both Washington and Oregon shows that each state can profit from the other. The Oregon grapes give more structure, acid, and delicate spice notes; while the baseline Washington fruit—melon and passion fruit—is bright and tangy and annotated with citrus andtangerine.",US-Washington:Gewürztraminer

"Another of Borra's inventive blends, this one brings together 60% Kerner, 20% Riesling and 20% Gewürztraminer. It opens aromatically with full-blown Riesling petrol. From there, the midweight texture turns to floral notes, grapefruit and herbs, along with minerality.",US-California:White Blend

"Toasty and dark-fruited, Huber's 2007 Bombacher Sommerhalde R falls somewhere between the Wildenstein and Malterdinger Bienenberg in style.

Drink 2018–2027.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Lush and velvety, this wine offers big, dark cherry flavor around a tangy minerality. From three vineyard blocks planted to Pommard and Swan clones, it balances opposites in the way full-bodied luxuriousness meets acidity-driven juiciness, creating a desire for more. Let this wine open in the glass or cellar through 2023.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A blend of almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller handfuls of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this estate-grown wine is sanguine in smoky leather and tobacco. Rich, with a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg, it has a lengthy finish that is balanced and elegant on the palate.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

A generous finish with plum and berry flavors as well as licorice is the right ending. Drink through 2018.",Spain-Catalonia:Red Blend

"This 100% Sauvignon Blanc aspires to the New Zealand style of crispness and dryness. It succeeds on both levels, with fruity, oaky flavors of lemons, limes and honeydew melons.

"Nothing small about this Pinot Noir. It's almost as good as the 2007, which was terrific.

Wonderful now, but the youthful power suggests time in the cellar through 2015 or so.",US-California:Pinot Noir

The opulent palate offers blackberry extract, dried plum, licorice and chocolate while velvety tannins provide support and give it a smooth texture. Drink through 2019.",Italy-Tuscany:Syrah

"Aromatic and stylish, this brings the alcohol down a point from the riper 2012 bottling, but rewards the patient sipper with finely rendered raspberry and cherry fruit and hints of orange peel. The supporting acidity brings freshness and length, while promising a substantial life ahead. Drink now through 2022.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot saw just a kiss (15%) of new French oak, putting the fruit aromas of plum, blueberry, cherry and herb at the fore. The coffee and berry flavors are lighter in style backed by a firm squeeze of slightly gritty tannins.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Thick, heavy, potent and mouth-coating, this is a liquorous, almost syrupy wine, sure to please those who like big fruit, big tannins, and big barrel flavors. Chocolate, espresso, tar and bourbon barrel flavors dominate, in keeping with the house style.",US-Washington:Syrah

"Very soft in the modern style, with flavors of melted milk chocolate, black currants, black cherry jam and black pepper. Could use greater tannin and acid structure.",US-California:Zinfandel
"For an entry-level bottling, this is a little stern at first. Hints of char and licorice issue forth after lengthy swirling, followed by vaguely berry-like flavors and mocha notes. Finally, dark fruit and spice emerge on the finish. Worth splashing in a decanter to wake it up prior to serving.",New Zealand-Central Otago:Pinot Noir
"This is a forward, even plush Reserve, loaded with generous black fruits and streaked with anise and cola notes. At first, the wine seemed to fade a bit too quickly, robbing the finish of expected complexity. But retasted on the second day, the wine had fleshed out beautifully.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"For all intents and purposes, this is a red wine. It's 90% red in color, and the nose and palate are chunky and wide. Flavors of red licorice and candied berry lack snap, and the finish tastes bitter and feels flat.",Spain-Northern Spain:Garnacha
"It would seem like other varieties must be in the mix on this perfumed wine with its notes of apricot, grapefruit and flowers. The flavors are lighter in style with a fresh feel.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"This pure Merlot has the grip and muscle often found in Washington fruit; in fact, it's a bit tight at first. Notes of red plum, strawberry and stiff tannins carry the medium finish, with a nice hint of dried herb.",US-Washington:Merlot
"One of the more fairly priced blends from the appellation on the market, this mix of Bentrock, Radian, Rancho La Vina and Huber vineyards shows black cardamom, chai spice, lemon oil, eucalyptus and concentrated, aromatic black raspberries on the nose. Once sipped, flavors of sour cherry meet with juniper and pine herbals.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Aged one year in small French barrel, Ripasso Corte Majoli is padded with extra oak tones of spice, toasted nut and tobacco that surround a fresh core of cherry fruit. In contrast to the bouquet, the wine feels sharp and crisp on the close.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"

"This is a solid Verdejo, with citrusy acidity and pulp to the palate. It shows modest melon and apple aromas and citrus and green herb flavors that finish with no major changes.",Spain-Central Spain:Verdejo
"Flinty reduction still dominates the nose but this is only a sign of youth in this nuanced wine. It discloses tentative pear blossom and fruit, plus notions of wet earth and candied lime. Above all, a zesty spine of acidity and freshness directs all the attention to a profound, stony core. There is life force here and you know this will continue to evolve.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris

"This Reserve Series bubbly accents its crisp green apple fruit with toasty aromas. Done via Méthode Champenoise, it spent five years en tirage. There's a fine bead and lingering persistent flavors with hints of nutmeg and lemon curd. All in all, this is a very fine effort.",US-Oregon:Sparkling Blend
"On the nose, this smells like bath soap or air freshener. It feels fleshy and oily on the palate, with tropical flavors of banana and papaya. The finish is smooth and tastes of candy.",Chile-Central Valley:Sauvignon Blanc

"This good, sturdy wine has ripe, broad fruit flavors, medium to full body, and a relaxed mouthfeel.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Ehren Jordan once again dips into this cult vineyard for his Central Coast Viognier, with spectacular results.

A brilliant evocation of Viognier to drink now.",US-California:Viognier

"Heavy and dull, with extracted raspberry jam flavors.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"You may have to scour the country to secure some of this (only 14 cases were imported), but this is a treasure worth the search. It's full bodied without seeming overly rich or heavy, framing the lush notes of dark berries, grilled meat, mint and licorice with supple tannins. Spice-driven flavors linger elegantly on the lengthy finish. It's delicious now, but should age gracefully through 2030.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
Classic varietal aromas of pear flesh and skin open into just slightly underripe fruit flavors. The wine is balanced and adds tart apple to the pear fruit.,US-Oregon:Pinot Gris

"Midlevel apple-based aromas are mild, as is a palate that's more basic than exciting. Oily tropical flavors of banana and pear turn slightly bitter on a finish that shows a green-leaning note of bell pepper.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Chardonnay
"This is the second label of Young Inglewood, a blend of 93% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot that spent 20 months in all-French oak, one quarter of it new.

"An improvement over the dull, mulchy 2005; this wine is still a little earthy, heavy and gaseous out of the bottle but with airing it offers ripe strawberry and plum flavors with licorice and tree-bark accents. Solid, a bit tannic and slightly resiny from barrel aging; but it's also a legitimate Pinot Noir with some elevated qualities.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Pinot Noir
"An awkward wine whose chief problem is the mouthfeel. It's bone dry and sharp, with unripe green flavors and harsh acidity. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",US-California:Petite Sirah

"Unusually supple for Fromm, but still featuring a heavy overlay of toasty, cedary oak. If you don't mind that in your Pinot, you may like this even more, because it does offer ripe cherry-berry flavors underneath. Drink over the near term.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Pinot Noir

Black plum, strawberry and a touch of mint mark the palate. The structure shows itself just enough on the finish.",US-California:Syrah
"Supple, spicy and loaded with tangy stone fruits, this outstanding offering shows that Pinot Blanc can develop some pleasing fleshiness when handled well in Oregon.

"A white with inviting floral aromas, this Lake County-sourced Sauvignon Blanc is layered with stone fruit and the region's signature tropical imprint. It's creamy in mouthfeel, to the point of being full-bodied, yet still bright.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc

"There's a lot of new oak in the nose, and it's tannic and has a fair amount of the volatile aromas that are found in several of the Hogue reds. The midpalate is soft to a fault, but shows hints of the spice and pepper of the grape. It finishes with volatility and unusually soft tannins. Tasting room exclusive.",US-Washington:Malbec

"This is a serious, impressive wine. Fermented in open stone tanks and wood aged, it has a rich texture that encompasses the ripe black fruits and the spicy tannins. The wine has real depth and concentration with a firm, dense structure that will allow it to age. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"Aromas of cardamom and clove as well as heat make for a challenging nose. In the mouth, heavy fruit combined with chippy tannins create a clipped feel. Ripe berry flavors are a bit jumbled, with oaky spice notes stepping up. A flat chunky finish is missing skip in its stride. This is 85% Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Red Blend
"Plum, black cherry and mocha cflavors ombine in this smooth, well-integrated wine. It must have seen some time in new oak, and the pretty baking spice accents add length and pleasure to the finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir

"Rugged, rustic, stalky aromas are a bit challenging. In the mouth, this is stout and tough, with hard tannins.

"An ultrapure nose and tons of polish and precision define this tasty reserve-style blend of several vineyards. Pretty much an easy-drinker, with an undercurrent of sweet cherries and vanilla. It hits all chords and fades away smooth. Style and power come in proper proportions. Will age nicely for at least five years.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Quilceda's Palengat is now a proprietary blend, not a strict Cabernet as before. You can smell the violets amidst nicely layered aromatics, built upon layers of black fruits, cassis and dark, smoky elements. Smoke, earth, coffee, a hint of iron and rock continue into the midpalate, which loses a little density as it moves through the finish. That may be a reflection of the young-ish (7 to 10 year old) vines.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Oak jumps out first, both on the nose and on the palate, before waves of grenadine liqueur and raspberry take over. Velvety in texture, the wine is earthy, with well-integrated tannins and a lingering finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Dark boysenberry, dried purple flowers, wet slate and a touch of bay leaf show on the nose of this thick and earthy bottling by the tech moguls T.J. and Valeta Rodgers. The mouthfeel is very chalky, and there is the winery's characteristic earthiness along with mocha and baking spice. But there are also brighter berry flavors, perhaps due to the sunnier slopes.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Cavallotto still travels under the radar, but is one of the finest Barolo producers. Its Bricco Boschis is bold and beautiful, offering intense rose and berry aromas layered with eucalyptus. The creamy palate delivers cherry, spice and balsamic notes, along with hints of Alpine herbs. To let this complex wine develop fully, drink it after 2019.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo

"Toasty, oaky and a bit lemony on the nose, this has baked apple notes that are friendly. It feels round and honeyed, with toasty, candied flavors that veer toward pear, apple and honey. Resin and cinnamon flavors work the soft, sweet-tasting finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Chardonnay
"A small parcel of vines produces this crisp, fragrant and very fruity wine. With its apple fruits and lightly oaked character, it's a bright wine, it's more taut texture showing some aging potential. Drink from 2015.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Here's an easy, bright and lively Valpolicella that would make a great companion to bean soup with heaps of grated Parmigiano cheese on top. It's a crisp, fresh wine with an informal but inviting personality.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This is a dense, dry wine, full of concentrated tannins and somewhat hard-edged. While it does have acidity, it misses out on the fruitiness and ends up being tough and tannic.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Ripe blueberry, black-cherry syrup, cola and clove cream combine for a complex nose on this bottling by winemaker Carl Bowker. The palate is vibrant with acidity, yet rich with baked blueberries. Waves of wild California herbs add further nuance, making for a wine that finds a nice balance between disparate elements.",US-California:Primitivo

"A decadent, dark and meaty Syrah, with plenty of sauvage tendencies amid a rich, velvety texture that finishes long and lushly perfumed with sweet smoke. In a cool year in El Dorado, Lava Cap has reined in this Syrah's tannins and let its dark cherry and plum flavors take center stage.",US-California:Syrah

"Attractive, somewhat unusual floral/violet aromas are in the lead, with blueberry, cassis and pastry sitting behind that.

Tasty, balanced and interesting; 60% Malbec and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon

"A big Cabernet, showing the dramatic mouthfeel that well-made Napa Cabernet always has. It's full bodied, dry and softly tannic, with classic blackberry and currant flavors. Should hold in the bottle for about six years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Better than in previous years but still brambly and stemmy smelling. The palate is sheer and fairly hollow in the center, with simple buttery raspberry flavors. Shows bits of burnt wood, oil and heat on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"A smooth, polished performance from this 100-acre estate. The 1997 is modern in style, exhibiting huge but not too-dominant wood aromas and flavors, balancing with sweet, ripe berry fruit and black cherry jam. This is a wine that should be accessible young in four or five years, but should certainly age well over the following 10 or more.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese

"Both a study of clone and stainless-steel processing, this wine offers fresh-cut pineapple, ripe Gala apple, honeydew and even peach, with a citrus-skin sharpness to the nose. The flavors are delicate and familiar but complex and deep, with Anjou pears, lemon-lime soda and apple flesh. It's a lively stainless expression.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Green apple and greengage on the nose turn into white peach and lemon on the palate. The mousse is frothy and lively and there is a wonderful depth to these tart fruit flavors that takes you to juicy, green pastures and white blossom. Glints of green apple flash at every corner and adorn the admirably dry finish. This echoes long and leaves the palate wonderfully clean.",England-England:Sparkling Blend

The tannins are ripe to the point of imparting a creamy texture yet the wine never seems overripe or jammy, maintaining a fine sense of balance on the lingering finish.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Strong, caramelized oak stars in this dry, rather one-dimensional Cabernet. Despite some black currant, anise and mocha flavors, it's like drinking toothpicks.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
A soft and fruity wine that brings out attractive red berries and ripe plum flavors. There is the lightest touch of structure in a wine that is totally ready to drink.,France-Languedoc-Roussillon:Pinot Noir
"Enticing aromas of perfumed berry, rose petal, scorched earth and spice lead the nose. On the palate, bracing tannins and bright acidity support crunchy strawberry, black cherry, clove and licorice. This is still all wound up and needs time to open. Drink 2018–2028.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"The very tannic '05 reserve is a blend of Petit Verdot, Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc. It's fleshy and rich in blackberry, cassis and tobacco flavors, with lots of new toasty oak, and there's something meaty, like ground hamburger with a splash of tamari. Utterly delicious and very fine, this low-production bottling should evolve over many years.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Fresh apple and pear flavors are swathed in fresh herbs and citrus peels in this bristling medium-sweet wine. It's lusciously honeyed but finishes long with honed steely precision.,Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"Tart red currant and red apple mingle with tangy citrus on nose and palate. Very frothy lively mousse fizzes across the palate, making it refreshing and appetizing. The citrus and tart red-fruit notes appear again on the clean dry finish, making it moreish and long.",France-Alsace:Sparkling Blend
"This wine shows roasted beef with blackberry crust, fresh-cracked black pepper and tarry asphalt on the nose. The asphalt and charred meat play strongly on the heavy-duty palate that also offers blackberry balsamic reduction. It's brawny and burly, perhaps too much so for the everyday drinker.",US-California:Syrah
"Pretty aromas of cherry and plum blossoms give way to fully ripe, slightly confectionary fruit, backed by hints of mocha. This medium-bodied Pinot Noir is supple in texture and softly dusty on the finish, making it an easy one to drink over the next couple of years.",Australia-South Australia:Pinot Noir
"Ryan Zepaltas coaxes complex aromas and flavors of baked Golden Delicious apple and anise around a well-constructed foundation of integrated oak, 33% of it new French. Cloudy in appearance, the wine sings in anise and tangy tangerine.",US-California:Chardonnay
"A strong, powerful Pinot that's nowhere ready to drink. That's despite massive blackberry, cherry, cola, red currant, licorice and sandalwood flavors that dazzle the palate. The tannins are potent, the acidity is tart and the finish is bone dry. Obviously needs time in the bottle. Try after 2013.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is a dark, plump expression of Sangiovese Grosso that delivers finely-tuned aromas of succulent fruit and blackberry. Notes of espresso and dark chocolate give the wine added dimension and staying power in the mouth.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"This is soft and easy in texture, light in flavors and slightly sweet. Light to medium bodied, it has very little tannin or astringency, is low in acidity and quiet on the finish.",US-California:Red Blend

"This blend smells outright herbaceous and weedy. An astringent volatile palate is grating, while this tastes much like it smells: weedy and green.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Red Blend
"Aromas suggesting tilled soil, sage and black-skinned fruit come together in the glass. On the firm palate, close-grained tannins support mature black plum, clove and a touch of star anise. Drink through 2020.",Italy-Piedmont:Barbera
"Here's a powerful Cabernet Sauvignon, ripe and opulent, offering summer blackberry, sour cherry candy, currant, dried herb and rose petal aromas and flavors. The addition of 21% Merlot brings a candied softness, but it's still pretty tannic, and wants 4–5 years in the cellar.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's a highly stemmy quality to this interesting wine from one of the appellation's multi-generation families. The nose shows funky herbs, papilla chile and raspberry extract, leading into a very spicy, savory palate of marjoram, Indian spices and green olive laid across pungent cranberry fruits. It's a winner for fans of stem inclusion.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"An entirely varietal wine, aged in a majority of stainless steel, this smoothly textured experience begins in peach and apricot with balanced acidity, dry as a bone. It entices with rounded creaminess and inviting floral and lemon highlights.",US-California:Gewürztraminer
"This Sicilian Grillo has bright aromas of candied fruit, lemon zest and caramel. The mouthfeel is syrupy and oily.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Grillo

"Produced at the Quinta do Gradil estate, this is a crisp, stalky and fruity wine. Black currants and hedgerow berry fruits are pushed forward by acidity. A hint of light wood aging helps smooth out the otherwise mineral aftertaste. Drink now.",Portugal-Lisboa:Portuguese Red
"Soft and rich, this Chardonnay shows intricately layered flavors of buttered toast, grilled peaches, orange jam, honeysuckle flowers and cinnamon. An opulent wine to drink now.",US-California:Chardonnay

"Here's a bigger, concentrated expression of Vino Nobile that delivers ripe fruit aromas of blackberry jam and spicy fruit. There's a touch of ripe strawberry at the back and although the fruit does taste mature here, you'll enjoy the softness and richness of the mouthfeel.",Italy-Tuscany:Prugnolo Gentile
"There is an earthy aspect to the yeasty flavors on the nose. The palate counters this with pure, streamlined lemon freshness and the very slightest of spritz. Very refreshing and wonderfully clean-cut citrus notes on a slender, zippy body.",Austria-Weinviertel:Grüner Veltliner
"A very pretty shade of pink, this wine offers strawberry blossoms and light cotton-candy elements on the nose. There's a strong zing of acidity at first, and then the wine clings to a steely sensibility, showing just brief glimmers of strawberry fruit and lime juice.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Here's a useful Syrah to generate some interest around a grilled steak or chop. It's rich in tannins and forwardly sweet in black cherry, blackberry, tobacco, leather, cinnamon and pepper flavors, and should develop for a few years.",US-California:Syrah
"A wine made like this doesn't come along every day. It was 100% whole-cluster fermented with wild yeast and aged in all neutral barrels. Its rich, soothing and complex personality makes it perfect for a special occasion that involves something like roast quail, sauteed mushrooms or beef bourgignon. It has full body and layered aromas of black tea, ripe plums and cigar box, combined with both fruity and savory flavors and fine tannins.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"From a historic vineyard property that has gone through recent restoration and some replanting, Old Kraft lies in the heart of the warm appellation, on its western edge below the Mayacamas Mountains. Mouthwatering red fruit takes on a brandy-like velvety hint of molasses as sturdy tannin rides shotgun with softly integrated oak. Cinnamon stick shines through on the finish.",US-California:Zinfandel
"One of the best Russian River Pinots you can buy at this price. Shows classically rich pomegranate, persimmon and cherry fruit, enhanced with sweet oak, with a silky texture and a long, spicy finish. Kudos to winemaker Ed Kurtzman for bringing it all together.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This Yakima Valley bottling highlights fresh herbs and sharp, juicy pear and apple fruit flavors.

A splendid effort that really sets the standard for Washington Pinot Gris.",US-Washington:Pinot Gris
"Juicy white grapefruit and lime flavors penetrate throughout this juicy, off-dry Riesling. It's refreshing and quaffable yet elegantly structured, finishing moderately long on a lingering lime-pith note.",Germany-Rheinhessen:Riesling
"Made entirely from Chardonnay, it shows real delicacy and richness, with a mousse as smooth as fine satin. Flavorwise, it's enormously rich, suggesting oranges, limes, honey, vanilla, toast and the sweet, yeasty doughiness of a brioche pastry. Really gorgeous, a worthy followup to the fabulous 2005 La Rêve.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"Part of the natural wine movement, this organically farmed blend of Nerello Mascalese, Nerello Cappuccio and Alicante shows harmony and elegance. It shows some age too, with aromas of tar, licorice, cassis, prune and dark tobacco. It feels supersmooth and silky.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Red Blend

"Here's a surprise from Mt. Etna that blew us away. Made by Pietro Caciorgna, this is a delicate and linear wine with pristine aromas of blue flower, delicate forest fruit and black stone. It represents the best of elegant winemaking with that unmistakable blast of volcanic power at the rear.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Red Blend
"Teeters on the verge of complexity, with dry, spicy flavors of raspberries and cherries. Good Carneros acidity makes for a brisk mouthfeel. Should develop for a year or three in the bottle.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Accurate varietal character abounds in this value red. There’s dark berry and a slight herbaceousness, but not in an off-putting way. Light in style but it possesses nice mouthfeel with smooth cassis fruit and a decent finish.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A little strange and unusual on the nose, with a mix of grass, citrus and corn-like aromas. The palate is wayward and slightly citrusy, with a hint of grapefruit and also some vegetal flavors. Pretty good mouthfeel and acidity keep it afloat, but overall it's not going to win over too many fans.",Spain-Galicia:White Blend
"This is unusual in that it's heavily oaked, as evidenced by aromas of varnish, hard spice and resin. The mouthfeel is fresh on top of resiny, while flavors of dry oak, spice and mild apple and citrus operate in the background. While this wine has depth of body and acidic lift, it's dominated by the barrel.",Spain-Northern Spain:White Blend
"In 1999, Stéphane and Paola Gabard resurrected winemaking at an estate that has belonged to the family since the 18th century. Ripe, rich and still retaining its youthful structure, this concentrated wine will need time. With its dense texture and layers of black-currant fruit, it has a fine future. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas suggesting underbrush, aromatic herb, violet, new leather and earthy game follow through to the chewy, full-bodied palate in this wine, along with ripe black cherry and a hint of baking spice.

"This Malbec-led blend (with Petit Verdot and Tannat) is muscular and piercing on the nose, with aromas of brick dust, black cherry, cassis and raisin. The palate is saturated and creamy, with a lactic sensation competing with rubbery tannins. Flavors of vanilla, raw oak, tomato, plum, herbs and chocolate are complex and finish with multiple interest points along with mild heat. Give this more time, if possible. Best from 2018 through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Red Blend
"While the tannins are still powerful and dense, the wine has rich berry fruits and juicy acidity that give freshness. It's ripe, well balanced, and full bodied, with a dark, concentrated character at the end. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a ripe, soft Cabernet, forward in blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. It's a little sweet, but the tannins give it proper support. Drink now.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
A lean wine with some austerity. It has a firmly tannic character while missing the fruit for the future.,France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"The vineyard is just east of the Silverado- Trail, below Dalla Valle and just up the street from Screaming Eagle. The wine, which is 100% Cabernet-, shows the intensely concentrated, ripe fruit of this neighborhood, packed with flavors of black-berry preserves, cassis liqueur and a touch of chocolate, wrapped into fine tannins and brightened by acidity. Give it at least eight years in the cellar.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sourced from vines planted in 1982, it's brightly aromatic with sweet floral notes, orange peel and lychee. Medium bodied, it drinks dry with abundant spice and floral flavors. A thoroughly delicious wine that begs to be paired with scallops or spicy Thai dishes.",US-Washington:Gewürztraminer
"This wine shows superb balance between ripe fruit tones, attractive oak influence and natural freshness. It leads with scents of lightly toasted nuts, orange cream, freshly dried grass and yellow flowers. The medium-weight palate offers decadent flavors of toasted apple skin and brioche, with orange-flavored acidity that lift's the wine's richness. An evolving finish seals the deal. Drink now–2020.",South Africa-Stellenbosch:Chardonnay
"A raw, rough, oaky flavor overwhelms the light and simple red fruit. Disjointed, with a bitter streak in the finish.",US-Washington:Barbera
"Another sweet, oaky Chardonnay joins the ever-growing line. Not that it's an indifferent wine. This family produces nothing but impeccably tailored wines, and this one is among the best of class at this price point. —S.H.",US-California:Chardonnay

"Somewhat sharp in acids and tannins, with a streak of green mint that weakens the blackberry and cherry flavors. Good structure, but a bit unripe and unbalanced, and not likely to age.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a bold, very ripe and full-bodied wine that has a good frame of firm tannins and acidity to give it an appetizing texture. While packed with plump, almost sweet flavors like blackberry jam, it is nicely dry and well balanced, leading to a lingering finish that last for 30 seconds.",US-California:Zinfandel
"A sweet wine, but lively, touched by honey, its acidity coming through as delicious final fruit and spice.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer

Clove and dried herb provide a savory edge to the experience, which remains integrated and polished in the glass, finishing with a sense of finesse.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"From a vineyard that's less than one acre in size, this special bottling is tiny but mighty, juicy in blue and red fruit. Robust in spice, it unleashes a velvety texture with ease, allowing room for focused tannin to be supportive rather than distracting. The finish retains a welcome freshness.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Thanks to its large case production, this crisp Greco di Tufo should be easy to locate at your local wine store or supermarket. It offers a wonderful introduction to southern Italian, volcanic soil winemaking thanks to drying mineral tones, pear and apple.",Italy-Southern Italy:Greco
"An excellent wine—it's big and brawny, but magnificently packed with flavors of briary fruit, cola and spices. It has all the weight, depth and length one could want, yet it never loses its delicacy and elegance. It's pretty tart in acidity, but that could help it develop. Try after 2015.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This wine is structured, firm and has a mineral, tight texture. It also offers plenty of red apples, green plums and a touch of apricot. However, with its nervy edge the wine needs to age; drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay

"This Barbaresco offers remarkable aromatic intensity and complexity that takes the form of white chocolate, small red berries, cola, road tar and red licorice. Based on the boldness of the nose, you'd expect the mouthfeel to be pulpy and fat. Instead, it is elegantly linear and tightly packed.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Though the alcohol comes close to 15%, this is still relatively light compared with other Spofford vineyard Syrahs. Sweet cherry candy, or cherry pie fruit is slathered in flavors of coconut/vanilla cream. It's tasty, though relatively simple, especially for fruit from this vineyard, which is known for its earthy terroir.",US-Oregon:Syrah
"Aromas like green apples and white peach, flavors like grapefruit and a crisp texture make this wine quite refreshing. Most people will like its overall fruitiness and medium body, and appreciate the fresh acidity. It's made with 25% Sémillon.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a big, rich Chardonnay, another monster lineup in Testarossa's single-vineyard series. Shows tightly knit apple and peach flavors very generously oaked, with the requisite additions of smoke, vanilla, and woody spices. There's something minerally in the middle that seems likely to preserve the wine, if you wish to age it. Very fine quality, and a super-good food wine.",US-California:Chardonnay
"If you are of the school that says rosé from Provence is the world's gold standard, then give this excellent newcomer a try.

Drink as soon as possible to capture this wine's fresh essence.",Spain-Northern Spain:Rosé

"Light and delicate on the nose with lime blossoms and damp herbs, this top-end bottling from Fred Brander shows lots of peppery energy once sipped. The tense palate is more about texture than flavors, yet wet cement, ripe lime, grass and oregano do make flashy appearances.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Chunky, ripe blackberry and cassis aromas come with baking spice scents. In the mouth, this feels broad, jammy and tannic, but under control.

"A Rochet property since 1865, now Joëlle, Daniel and Fabienne Rochet manage the 210 acres. Bright, light and textured, this is a crisp and refreshing wine.

"Made with 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot, this estate-grown wine is made in small lots and offers aromas of baked bread and red fruit from the get-go. The Cabernet shows its presence, and there's a wealth of bitter, leathery tannin offset by soft, approachable oak.",US-California:Merlot
"This kitchen sink blend combines 12 varieties, from Syrah and Malbec to Tinta Cao and Bastardo, and offers coffee, dark chocolate and beef char on the nose. More coffee arises on the palate along with blackberry, black cherry, unsweetened cocoa powder and vanilla.",US-California:Red Blend
"Zesty, full-bodied and expansive on the palate, this is a wine that comes around in time, in the glass and in the bottle or decanter. Briny and dancing a fine line between brawn and beauty, it paints a picture of classic green and yellow apple and subtle vanilla spice, with a tropical flirtation happening in the background. Structured, it should cellar well, through 2020.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This saturated, golden Pecorino (a native white grape of central Italy) drinks like a red wine and would pair with roast chicken or veal in cream sauce. It shows density and determined flavors of apricot, melon and pineapple.",Italy-Central Italy:Pecorino
"Tannins form a dark barrier to start this wine. It is still young, dense with chocolate as well as fruit flavors, showing the bitter, tough flavors that come from too much extraction. The fruit will hopefully come through and soften the tannins and bring out the richness. Drink from 2018.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay

Round and soft, it's easy to drink and will be approachable to a variety of palates.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Stalky, gritty aromas of olive, eucalyptus and berry fruits are 100% Chilean. This feels big, wide and tannic.

"Bridgitte and her husband Eric took over her family property in 2009, in 2014 producing a spicy and fruity wine. It has fine tannins and sweet red-berry fruit.

"The nose beguiles, with scents of vanilla, freshly baked bread and wet stones that give way to tones of lemon and apricot on the tongue. This wine is light-bodied and crisp, a good summer sipper. Drink up over the next year, perhaps with a piece of grilled fish.",France-Alsace:Riesling

Try as an interesting alternative to an upscale Chardonnay.",US-California:Roussanne

It's a bigger, thicker expression of the wine with firm tannins and ripe berry flavors backed by just enough acidity to keep the palate refreshed.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso

"A big wine for Merlot, this high alcohol (14.6%) effort ramps up its black cherry fruit with volatile acidity and brings in chocolaty barrel flavors under an earthy, tannic finish. Another year or two in the bottle can only help; at this young age it seems a little blowsy and sharp.",US-Oregon:Merlot
"Designed by Delicato winemaker James Ewart as a Pinot with power that can handle a steak, this wine features a dense, dark nose, with blackberry, olallieberry and red currant cut by allspice, clove and licorice-vanilla cookies.

It's boisterous and fresh, so drink now with a juicy rib-eye.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Saffron and dusty mineral tones seep into notes of marmalade and candied orange peel in this intensely ripe honeyed Riesling.

It's dazzling now, a veritable explosion of sweetness, acidity and minerality, but should meld beautifully from 2020-2025.",Germany-Rheinhessen:Riesling

Intense, especially toward the finish, it finds a thread of acidity in the background to lift itself up.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This is a solid wine, with complex tannins that sit over the ripe plum and berry-fruit tones. It is balanced, yet still young showing the wood aging as well as considerable juicy acidity. This wine, with its structure, needs to age. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Leesy white fruit aromas open this blend of 80% Albariño with Loureiro and Treixadura. In the mouth, it's all citric acidity and stoniness. The body doesn't register. Flavors of blood orange and lemon are also minerally, while the finish is persistently linear.",Spain-Galicia:White Blend

"The nose on this structured wine is rather subdued but eventually reveals notes of crushed blue flower, blackberry and leather. The palate offers mature black cherry, raspberry, black pepper and sage alongside raspy tannins.",Italy-Central Italy:Sagrantino
"Given four years in 100% new French oak and another year in bottle, this is a blockbuster of a wine. It's huge in every way, from its intensity of coconut, vanilla and milk chocolate to its dense, chalky tannins. It may need time to come around, its sheer weight impressively wrapped in blackberry and blueberry jam.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"A beautifully crafted wine that has both richness and sweetness. It brings together the fresh character of 2006 with more powerful elements, such as new wood and spice, enveloped plushly with ripe fruit. The tannins have a dark element, but fit well with the sweet fruit. All in all, a delicious wine that also has aging potential.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Piccini offers a great opportunity to experience Brunello di Montalcino to those who may not already be familiar with this storied Tuscan wine. Available at a more attractive price, the wine is lean and compact with bright notes of cherry, blackberry and exotic spice.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Here is a deeply saturated Chardonnay with a golden color and thick notes of candied fruit, almond, butterscotch and a playful hint of pecorino cheese rind. The wine is thick and succulent in the mouth, with a soft approach that is capped by a piquant, almost spicy finish.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Chardonnay
"Very crisp, refreshing and nicely dry, this light copper-colored wine surrounds a core of fresh raspberry flavors with light spicy nuances and a texture that turns vibrant bubbles into a creamy sensation on the finish.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"Muddled, murky initial aromas of earth and loam give way to leathery berry and stalky notes. The wine is tangy in the mouth, with red plum and berry flavors that carry aftershocks of minty oak and herbs. A modest, fresh, red-berry finish is, at most, medium in weight.",Spain-Northern Spain:Graciano
"This wine is at the top of its class in a new generation of super Tuscan producers. Plush and velvety, it opens with rich aromas of chocolate, cherry, peppercorn, black fruit and cola. Thick extraction sets the tone for a lush wine that requires a few more years in the bottle: Drink after 2012.",Italy-Tuscany:Merlot
"Olive, herbs, black pepper and minerality accent core black cherry and berry aromas. It's a touch choppy and tight in the mouth, with decent structure and mildly herbal flavors of blackberry and plum. Finishes lightly herbal and easy.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Smoky in dark clove and black pepper, this is a smooth, bright Zinfandel from head-trained, dry-farmed vines planted in the 19th century. After skipping the 2011 vintage, the winery returns with this stunner, brambly in succulent blackberry with plenty of intriguing spice.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Butter, pear and baking spice aromas are followed by a rounded palate with sweet fruit flavors. Pair it with baked chicken.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"92-94 Very structured wine, its fruit tannins dominant. It has power and extreme concentration. Dark and dense.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Made from old vines, this is a powerful wine that is reminiscent of a dry Port. This gives the wine density and richness, along with firm tannins and flavors from the wood aging. The black fruits are still developing, showing youthful freshness. This intense wine has plenty of development ahead of it; drink from 2018.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"Made from organic grapes, Green Truck's Petite has not a lot going on aromatically and exhibits very little in the way of the variety's profile, tasting like generic red wine.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"A blend of McLaren Vale, Hunter Valley and Beechworth fruit went into this bottling, and the components have knit together well. The wine is sappy and floral on the nose, and silky-textured on the palate, loaded with raspberry and blueberry fruit and ample peppery spice. Drink now through 2020+.",Australia-Australia Other:Shiraz
"There's a glimpse of dried herb and rosemary behind more intense aromas of black fruit, cherry and leather. This rich wine is concentrated and persistent, and it should pair well with stewed meat dishes.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Cannonau
"This Cerise Vineyard Pinot is rich and bright and as delicious as a cherry tart. Silky and substantial, the finish has a pleasant herbal undertone that almost delves into leather. A great food-pairing wine, enjoy it with pork tenderloin or bacon-wrapped figs or dates.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Vionta aims for the racy, lively style of Albariño, and for the most part it nails it. Aromas of peach and nectarine are youthful and pure, while the flavors of apple, peach and lime are pleasant. Not over the top but instead it achieves balance and ease. Imported by Freixenet, USA.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño
"96-98 Barrel sample. A powerful, complex wine, its layers of sweetness mixed with a total dryness from botrytis. The wine is impressively rich, considerably inspired by dried fruits and spice. Certainly for aging over decades.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Concentrated tannins balance this juicy red-berry flavor wine. The wine is still very young, showing its tannins strongly. They will certainly integrate. Drink this potentially rich wine from 2022.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Still dry, the wine is structured with dense tannins and a concentrated structure. That means that it needs time to develop and allow the fruit to speak. Give it until 2019.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Here's a very tight, young Pinot, one you'll want to put some bottle age on. It's marked by acids and oak flavors that have not yet been integrated into the underlying fruit. Give it through 2008, by which time the smoky wood and vanilla should marry with the cherries and Dr. Pepper flavors to produce a rich, complex sipper.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This Blanc de Blancs has shed its initial minerality and gained rich fruitiness. Apricots as well as more citrus flavors abound, bringing out a full and round character. From Grand Cru vineyards on the Côte des Blancs, this is ready to drink.",France-Champagne:Chardonnay
"Tasted in a flight with far more expensive wines, this Pinot stood proud. It's dry and richly complex, with the silk-and-satin texture you want. The flavors reward with cherries, cola, Canadian bacon, Indian spices and sandalwood. At this price, it's a steal.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Honey and almond notes lend a nutty earthiness to lifted citrus aromas. It's concentrated with sweet tangerine flavor, and has a sharp, zesty acidity that drives a moderately long finish.",US-New York:Riesling
"Raisin-baked plum defines this hearty, full-bodied and ultraripe wine, rich in red berry and robust on the finish.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Ripe, sweet and stylish, with blackberry, root beer and herb aromas. Bulky yet balanced, with black cherry fruit that comes at you in jammy style. Black tea, ground spices, coffee and raw oak work the finish. A dark and handsome wine, but one that isn't overly complex and is ready to drink now through 2011.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Clos du Val has always made wines with long-term cellaring in mind. This blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon, is dry and tannic, with spicy, toasty oak dominating. Beneath that are rich, compelling notes of cassis and dark chocolate. The alcohol is refeshingly low, below 14%. This dramatic wine needs a minimum of six years, and should develop for at least ten.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of blue flower, wild berry, a hint of leather and brimstone lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The palate delivers black cherry, crushed raspberry, grilled herb, oak, mineral and a hint of vanilla alongside firm, polished tannins that need to unwind. Drink 2017–2022.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Red Blend
"Heavily dominated by Merlot, this is a generous and full-bodied wine. Wood aging has left its mark in the burnt, toasty character. The fruit, though, is generous, bringing out the richness of the limestone soil. This wine will be ripe and full-bodied. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
This Syrah shows just a touch of smokiness. It has vital acids and furry tannins that structure the cherry pie flavor. Great for drinking now if you're looking for a medium-bodied selection.,US-California:Syrah
"A brawny bottling from one of the state's most historic vineyards, this wine offers wild berries, turned earth, shiitake mushrooms and a light cinnamon glaze on the hearty nose. Rich cherry and plum fruit shows on the tip of the sip followed by rising waves of anise, eucalyptus and white sage. The mouthfeel is soft but with aggressive acidity.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This pretty vineyard-designate Barbera d'Alba delivers a fresh bouquet of floral, fruit and spice aromas. The wine is tonic and firm with a bright, crisp close.",Italy-Piedmont:Barbera
Ripe perfumed black fruits dominate this cru wine. They float above the firm tannins and concentrated acidity to offer a wine that will become rich and generous as it develops. A touch of pepper and spice adds to the layers of fruit. Drink from 2018,France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"This is a quintessential expression of young Nebbiolo, with pretty floral and strawberry notes that carry onto the palate, along with raspberry and mineral nuances and a whiff of spice. A bright, elegant wine made to be drunk young. Imported by Masciarelli Wine Co, Moonlight Wine Co.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo

"Yeasty pepperiness and savory spice pervade the lemony core of this zippy Grüner. The body is light but offers interest and refreshment. A very moreish, spicy little number.",Austria-Niederösterreich:Grüner Veltliner
"This is one of the better California Tempranillos out there. It's delicate and silky on the palate, and earthy despite rich raspberry and cherry fruit. Balanced with crisp acidity and a scour of dusty tannins, it's complex enough to enjoy with a great steak, especially with mushrooms. A consistent followup to the winery's 2010.",US-California:Tempranillo
"Gold in color, with aromas of hay, melon and banana, this feels plump and round, with a fair amount of skins-based tannin. Nectarine and orange flavors finish full and snappy.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño
"Aromas of prune, blackcurrant, toast and oak carry through to the extracted palate, along with flavors of black cherry and roasted coffee beans. Firm but drying tannins provide the framework.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nero d'Avola
"Light in color, aromas of barrel spice, herb and red fruit rise up from the glass. The palate packs a mouthful of red-fruit flavors, with the tannins showing a bit of astringency.",US-Washington:Sangiovese
"Gooseberry and hop aromas are atypical for a Chardonnay, yet they surprisingly meld well with vanilla biscuit and peach tones. The medium-bodied palate brings lemon curd and brûléed peach flavors that carry to a vanilla-cream finish. Snappy acidity—presumably from the addition of 7% Petit Manseng—keeps the palate lively and in check.",US-Virginia:Chardonnay
"Pronounced struck flint and candle wax aromas fade with time and aeration, revealing delicate white blossom and lemon rind notes in this off-dry wine. It's an intensely racy Kabinett with salt-rimmed lime and lemon flavors that dart and dash on the palate. Enjoy now for its radiant youthfulness, but also as it matures over the next decade.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"Classic gooseberry and pink grapefruit notes feature gentle herbal nuances on the nose. There's ample weight and texture on the palate, with a burst of mouthwatering citrus on the finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a good but generic Chilean Cabernet, meaning it's a bit herbal and fiery, with eucalyptus on the nose. In the mouth, this is medium in intensity and modest in character. Flavors of herbal red berry, carob and dried leaves end with a touch of heat.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A color so deep it could be a Pinot Noir, flavors bursting with plum and wild blackberry and a velvety texture make this dry rosé taste more like a red. Bucking the trend toward lightness, it has medium body, a creamy mouthfeel and lingering finish.",US-California:Rosé
"A full, fruity wine, this is softly textured and creamily ready to drink. Lime juice and crisp apples are underlined by the faint flavor of oak from wood aging. The acidity gives wonderfully drinkable freshness.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
Lusciously ripe apricots and yellow peaches are electrified by racy streaks of acidity in this dry Riesling. It's light in body yet creamy and expansive on the palate. The finish is long and crisply mineral.,Germany-Nahe:Riesling
"Grown on the slopes above the Garonne river, this is a crisp wine with attractive black-currant fruitiness. It has soft tannins that are well integrated into the fruitiness and acidity of the wine. The aftertaste is crisp and the wine is ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Scorched earth, underbrush, cured meat and grilled sage aromas lead the way together with a whiff of new leather. The ripe, juicy palate doles out black raspberry, succulent wild cherry, baking spice and a hint of tobacco. Packed but mature tannins retrain the rich fruit.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This is a solid, structured, mineral-driven wine from a famous vineyard. It is firm and dense, its big plum and berry flavors are supported by dry tannins and an herbal spice character. With its firm style, it needs to age for at least two years.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"This seems designed to appeal to the Moscato-loving crowd. It has sweet flavors, with apricot and tangerine notes that taste like fruit juice.",US-California:Viognier
"Named after the small grey lizards that are common in Beaujolais, this is bright and friendly wine. It is soft with red fruits and balanced acidity. Perfumed and fruity, the wine is ready to drink.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"From the appellation that is at a summit of Loire sweet wines, this golden wine balances intense acidity with intense botrytis and honey flavors. Ripe peaches and pineapples dominate the fruit profile of this concentrated, beautiful wine. It is just approaching its peak, so wait a little longer, until 2018.",France-Loire Valley:Chenin Blanc
"With spicy oak and very ripe fruit aromas, this wine is full bodied and mouthfilling, with rounded tannins and good flavor length on the finish. A very good example of the varietal, it's easy to enjoy.",US-California:Sangiovese
"Pieropan's La Rocca distinguishes itself from the Calvarino bottling by firmer structure and greater ageability. Tasted in spring 2003, this effort still has plenty of life left. Mimics Sauvignon a little in its gooseberry and red-currant flavors and grapefruity acidity.",Italy-Veneto:White Blend
"Made with organically farmed grapes, this rustic wine opens with funky aromas of game, wet animal fur, scorched earth, overripe berry and a whiff of barnyard. These carry over to the palate along with underbrush, licorice, and toasted almond notes but not much fruit. Tried twice with identical notes.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nerello Mascalese
"A dense, slightly raisiny nose indicates ripeness, but the palate on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Carmenere and Petit Verdot is healthy and not overly heavy. Creamy, oak-infused flavors of plum and berry are uncomplicated and balanced, while pastry, vanilla and berry fruits grace a long, harmonious finish. Drink through 2015.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Red Blend
"Fresh Granny Smith apple and lemon notes are announced on the nose. On the palate they become fully fledged and weave their refreshing, uncompromisingly dry way across a slender dry body. This is very refreshing and totally invigorating: light yet full of flavor. The finish is long and dry.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"Green tannins mark this dry Pinot Noir, and the astringency accentuates the acidity, giving the wine a harsh mouthfeel. Although it has expressive cherry, pomegranate and cola flavors, it's a big disappointment, coming from this famous vineyard and block.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This 100% Petite Sirah is very, very sweet. When the palate experiences this much concentrated brown sugar and caramel, it exults. The problem is that sweetness is pretty much all there is. You'll find blackberry jam and chocolate.",US-California:Port
"This is the best of the new releases from Seven Bridges, a Portland-based winery with a penchant for Washington State fruit. Smooth, balanced and mouth-filling, this offers a truffle highlight that sits over the bright berry and cherry flavors.",US-Oregon:Merlot
"A big, fat and rich wine, with tropical fruit flavors. There is spice from the prominent wood with an edge of vanilla. It's a powerhouse of a Chardonnay, ripe and full, the acidity lending crispness to the finish.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Strawberry and raspberry fruit carry a nice touch of bright spice, notably saffron. Some 30% new French oak was used, and the wine expresses it with highlights of toasted coconut. The wine has medium concentration and length, and will benefit from aggressive aeration.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Firm and dense, this is a fine example of the Baga grape. It gives both juicy blackberry and red berry notes, with a solid layer of firm tannins. It has the power, the structure and the acidity to see sometime in the cellar. Drink after 2016.",Portugal-Bairrada:Baga
"Encapsulated in a big, beautifully etched bottle with black wax closure, Grand Wren is a grand statement—an explosion of smoke, leather and ripe fruit. It's smooth in texture, but with streaks of bright acidity throughout. The finish is big and bold with a Port-like intensity.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Tastes a little simple and candied, but it's so delicious, you can hardly stop sipping. Rich and ripe in cherry and raspberry Lifesaver fruit and pie filling, with plenty of sweet vanilla and spice. Drink now.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Blended with a splash of Grenache Blanc, this white is floral, viscous and full of a nutty character. It's the first vintage in which the producer has included grapes from Catie's Corner.",US-California:Viognier
"Rich, ripe and spicy, this single-vineyard Pinot shows pie-filling fruit flavors of cherries, black raspberries and red currants. It's a lusty wine that could use a little more complexity and layers of interest.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Screams Carneros. Fleshy, jammy fruit flavors of cherries, strawberries and raspberries are highlighted by good acidity and drink very dry, with soft but complex tannins. It's not a simple wine, and has enough stuffing to cellar for a few years.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A little prickly and sharp on the nose, with cherry, raspberry and piney aromas. The palate is racy, healthy and solid, with wild herb notes giving character to more basic but ripe blackberry and oak-based coffee flavors. Finishes long and whole, with a final dusting of dried herbs.",Spain-Northern Spain:Mencía
"There's a slightly sweaty note in the nose, but plenty of fruit in the mouth. Blueberry and black cherry, cassis and blue plum gather with substantial earthy chewy tannins. The high alcohol that's listed does not show in the flavor or the finish; in fact, this does a bit of a quick fade into flavors of coffee grounds.",US-Oregon:Malbec
"Touches of vanilla accent flavors of freshly pressed apples and pears in this bold, full-bodied wine. Piercing lemon acidity adds freshness to the palate, but the finish is a bit warming overall.",US-New York:Chardonnay
"Restrained Meyer lemon and slender zestiness characterize this featherlight wine that nonetheless has a concentrated, melting core and convinces with simple purity.",Austria-Kamptal:Riesling
"A fine trio of vineyards—Boushey, Cold Creek and Sagemoor—comprise the blend here. The fruit runs the table from cherry to blackberry to cassis, threaded throughout with fresh herbs and clean earth. Good balance with no heat from the 14.7% alcohol; the tannins are polished and drying, and the finish has a soft, leathery smoothness.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"The raspberry and cherry flavors are a bit obvious at first, but then the balanced tannins and acids become apparent, and the tasteful application of sweet, smoky oak surfaces. This wine grows more interesting as it sits in the glass. Drink it now and over the next 3–4 years for maximum freshness.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Fairly neutral on the nose, but clean and easy to get into. The palate offers good acidity and vitality for Maule SB, with tropical fruit leading the flavor profile followed by pithy green notes. Overall this is a good value white.",Chile-Maule Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"This stunning white opens with aromas that recall white wild flower, orchard fruit and heady scents of eucalyptus and dried herb. The rich palate delivers white peach, ripe pear, wild rosemary, thyme, flinty mineral and ginger. Fresh acidity frames the juicy fruit flavors while an almond note backs up the finish.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Vermentino
"While the nose gives little away, the palate has a shy but very seductive nature: floral borders of honeysuckle adorn the edges of tart, fresh apple fruit and are highlighted by lemony acidity. The body is light and dry and shows playfulness and charm against a more serious, stony background. A very charming, subtle wine.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"This dark, brooding wine is still tight and closed. It's powerful and concentrated, with gripping tannins as well as delicious black fruits. It's solid, chunky and very firm while retaining the generous fruitiness of the vintage. Don't drink before 2020.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Cortina refers to the soil type. The wine shows forward, pretty fruit, mixing berries and cherries, and follows up with bright, clean, mouth-friendly flavors. Falls off in the finish, with some dry tannins.",US-California:Zinfandel
"With fine, dusty tannins, this rich and juicy wine wears its fruit on its sleeve, all black plums and blackberry flavors. The acidity of the year is almost sweet with the fresh ripeness of the fruit. It is developing well, showing a medium-term future. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is richly powerful, packed with dark plum fruits and solid, concentrated tannins. At this stage, it is closed, a potential powerhouse of firm fruits and structure. It has weight, the fruit and the firm texture all promising long-term aging. Drink from 2020.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Mint aromas from new oak aging and spice and toast notes on the palate are part of this young, firm-structured wine. It 's powerful and dense, with great black fruit and acidity. A dry core of tannins indicates it will age. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine opens with pleasing cocoa, dark raspberry and graphite aromas. The palate offers medium-bodied, tart fruit flavors cinched with tannin. A big, bold interpretation of Merlot.",US-Washington:Merlot
"The latest Artist Series Cab is mostly old vine Champoux vineyard fruit, and displays single-vineyard character as a result. Big, powerful, full, round black cherry fruit grabs the center, just on the edge of jammy, supported with juicy acidity. This wine is still quite young and edgy, but will reward cellaring over a decade or more, as is usually the case with Woodward Canyon Cabs.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Baked apple and buttercup aromas get it going in a good way, but the palate doesn't really keep the momentum. It's citrusy but low in acid, while the flavors are simple and narrow as they revolve around citrus fruits. Chunky and soft on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Chardonnay
"Backsberg's wines have style, and this Chenin is another in a line of successes. An assertive nose of pear, apple, honey and flowers leads a wine offering lovely citrus and floral flavors, cut slightly with a dancing acidity. The wine has dimension but a fresh edge.",South Africa-Western Cape:Chenin Blanc
"With stalky fruit and black currant acidity, the wine starts out lean. Then a richer, smoky wood character gives weight and sweeter flavors. Give the wine a year.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The majority of grapes within this red are grown in Yountville and certified organic. Simple aromatics make way for a touch of reduction on the nose, while flavors of brushy sage, cedar and clove offer more spice than fruit. Sharp tannins lie beneath.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This vintage of Lascombes shows more restraint on oak than previous vintages. The result is a ripe wine, still showing some wood flavors although it is already beginning to balance these with the black fruits. It has an opulent style that is warm and generous. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Another fine Cabernet from Prime, following a great 2009. This '10 is perhaps a little off pace from the prior vintage, but is nonetheless impressive. Dry and smoothly tannic, it shows complicated blackberry, blueberry, black currant, sage and mineral flavors. Give it at least six years in a good cellar.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Under the watchful eye of consultant Eric Delacroix, the Bazin twins (Thierry and Odile) created a wine that is dark and dense. This is a young wine with good potential. Its black fruits and solid tannins are rich and structured. Acidity and ripeness go together and will let the wine develop well. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The fruit for this Columbia Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is sourced from a dozen different vineyards, blended into a firm, purely varietal example of Washington Cabernet Sauvignon. The rich aromatics of black fruits, baking spices, dust, and cocoa powder roll into a full-flavored midpalate, enhanced with a light floral component.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Has the luscious tannins and beautiful acids you expect from Napa, and some rich plummy, berry flavors. Also possesses a depth and weight that are appropriate for the price. There's a bit of roughness, though, that detracts.",US-California:Merlot
"Framed beautifully with scents and flavors of toasted hazelnut (the property was orginally a walnut, hazelnut and plum orchard), this builds its substantial core around deep black cherry fruit. The density and length are impressive, and though delicious already, it will surely gain in complexity with further aging. Drink now through 2025.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Just what Sauvignon Blanc should be. Fresh and clean with grassy and melon notes present throughout. Vibrant acidity, a smooth mouthfeel and a long finish complete this very lively wine. Would make a great aperitif.",South Africa-Stellenbosch:Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of moist earth, black fruit, pencil lead and slightly overripe red apple are followed by a firm palate backed by lightly grippy tannins. This wine needs some food to keep them in check.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
Very juicy aromas of blueberry pie with a buttered crust and vanilla ice cream bring great promise to this Malbec. It carries through with a very round and broad mouthfeel and rich plum flavors with cracked black pepper. The tannins are a tad astringent.,US-California:Malbec
"Sweet buttered toast, buttered popcorn and fruit-cocktail flavors are what you get in this Chardonnay. It has a brisk hit of acidity, but remains simple.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Loosen's best Dr. L to date, this is a terrific value, delivering typical Mosel Riesling notes at a great price. Citrus blossom, lime and crushed stone aromas are followed by apple and citrus flavors in this just-slightly-sweet wine. Drink it now and over the next year or so.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"A blend dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this is a likable wine, rich in red berry, currant and vanilla. Firm, integrated tannins behave on the back of the palate, allowing for a softness amid the robust, full-bodied concentration.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"One of the most attractive aspects of this fresh white blend is its structure: The wine is silky and smooth and seemingly weightless at the same time. That kind of structure is a good platform for flavors of pear, exotic fruit, honey and almond. Try it with grilled shrimp in a cilantro pesto sauce.",Italy-Veneto:White Blend
"Merlot and Sangiovese make up nearly equal parts of this wine, with smaller amounts of Montepulciano, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Cola, vanilla and cherry are walled within full-bodied weight and tannin, with a simple structure and finish.",US-California:Red Blend
"This is one of the sweetest white California dessert wines out there. It's addictively decadent, like an upscale Sauternes. Barrel fermentation in new French oak gives an opulent, palate-flattering honeyed vanilla richness to the apricot, peach, pineapple and crème brûlée flavors that are so rich and refined. Crisp acidity provide clean, vibrant balance. Just gorgeous, and worth the price.",US-California:Sémillon
"Tinged by layers of earth and herb, this delicately framed wine carries surprising nuance and complexity. Concentrated in black plum and berry flavors, it's levitated by a streak of cranberry acidity that lingers moderately long.",US-New York:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A drier, lower alcohol and more streamlined Cab, it shows elegant control. Yet the fruit is Paso ripe, with blackberries veering into red currants, dark chocolate and raisins. The acidity is pronounced and a little uncomfortable. Drink it now, after careful decanting.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a finely balanced wine, combining an herbaceous flavor with apricot and sweet pear. The whole is a delicious wine that brings together notes of toast and fresh fruit, with a firm, dry structure. For long-term aging.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"A rich, lush melange of fruit and nuts, with sinuous, almost unctuous flavors that twine around the palate like a snake. Long, fascinating finish, elegantly balanced and precise.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Blackberry jam and plum cake aromas lead the nose of this simple but well made semisweet sparkling wine. The palate mirrors the nose, while bright acidity lends freshness.",Italy-Central Italy:Lambrusco

The apricot and other stone fruit flavors are medium bodied, simultaneously light and rich, giving the perception of sweetness leading to a lingering finish—an elegantly styled wine that walks the balance beam quite well.",US-Washington:Viognier
"This red blend is dry, tannic and coarse. It's also packed with cherry and blackberry jam flavors.",US-California:Red Blend

"This gorgeous wine is full of ripe fruits, which are balanced with solid tannins, produing a complex, densely structured wine. It shows promise for the long term.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Fairly intense and flavorful, this Chard expresses assertive aromas and flavors of wood-grilled peaches, buttercream frosting, lemon custard and toasted brioche. Medium weight in the mouth with good balance and a touch of baking spice on the close.",South Africa-Stellenbosch:Chardonnay
"From a very high altitude vineyard, this solidly built Syrah is soft and saturated with dark fruits. It has an earthy base and a broad midpalate, that lasts well but could use just a bit more focus. This is the first Syrah from this young vineyard, and it's definitely headed in the right direction.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Tea, tomato, raspberry and spice aromas are typical for Leyda Pinot. The body is a bit light and hollow, but that also means it's not heavy. Raspberry and spiced tea flavors control the palate, while plum, spice and light herb flavors work the almost dilute finish.",Chile-Leyda Valley:Pinot Noir
"Fleshy aromas of melon and apple fold in a few crumbs of vanilla cookie. This Viura feels healthy and balanced, with white-fruit flavors accented by tropical notes and green herbs. On the finish, lettuce and lime flavors hold steady. Drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain:White Blend

Textural and dense, it carries across and through the palate into a lingering, mineral-drenched finish. Superb already, it could be cellared through 2024 or longer.",US-Washington:Riesling
"Initial aromas are scratchy and piercing, but with airing this blend of Syrah, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon offers intriguing notes of vanilla, tobacco and charcoal. In the mouth, this is undeniably thick and tannic. Flavors are saturated and suggest blackberry and cassis. The finish leans toward syrupy but maintains acidity for balance. Drink through 2018.",Spain-Levante:Red Blend
"From an amazing vineyard set at 1,200 feet with ocean views across the Carmel Valley, this bottling shows soft plum and strawberry fruit along with wild thyme, wet slate, a touch of smoke and purple-flower essence. A lively mouthfeel presents flavors of red plum, wild forest berries, chipped slate and sandalwood on a medium-light body.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Gold in color, then waxy and baked on the nose, this Verdejo seems a bit overripe and soft. Melony on the palate, with soft flavors of waxy citrus, melon and mango, the wine lacks kick come finishing time.",Spain-Northern Spain:Verdejo
"Serious and earthy, like walking into a wall of minerality. The fruit takes a back seat here, but is lusciously peachy and fresh while the long finish is sparked by hints of exotic spices. Give this two to three years to show its best.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"In every vintage this blend of Cabernet, Malbec, Merlot and Carmenère gets a little better, and the 2005 is the best yet. It's a ripe one for sure, with licorice, kirsch and earthy warmth on the nose. The body is big and the wine tastes of berry jam, licorice and chocolate. Balanced and long, with bitter espresso on the finish. Drink now through 2010.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Red Blend
"This producer is honing in on the unconventional, sourcing Pinot Noir grapes from unlikely Napa Valley spots like Spring Mountain and Atlas Peak. The resulting wines are surprising and unpredictable in their complexity of savory blithe spirit, light and clear with edgy red cherry and tea, plenty structured, with lurking tannin. The floral aspect on the nose is compelling, as is the cardamon finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This lively white is floral in honeysuckle aromas, while creamy, rounded layers of apricot play on the full-bodied palate. A spicy nutmeg chaser closes things out. Well balanced and accessible, this is ready to drink now.",US-California:Viognier
"Even after five years, this wine still shows its primary fruit—black plums, sweet but structured. Callabriga, a Tinta Roriz based wine, goes light on the acidity, but the tannins and the hints of vanilla balance well with the blackberry jam fruits.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"Blended with small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this has pinpoint focus and is packed with ripe berry fruit. The oak aging (45% new) and crisp tannins layer in veins of espresso and dark chocolate. Drink now through 2022.",US-Washington:Malbec

"Baked black plum, gingerbread, dried mint, clove-laden cherry pie and a touch of light licorice show on the nose of this rich style of Pinot from the Santa Ynez-based, family-owned winery. The palate starts with rich black-cherry fruit, but then dives into an intriguing wash of thyme, sagebrush and anise, finishing on dried cranberry and pomegranate.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Shows modest dark cherry fruit with cedar and leather accents. A lean, even mouthfeel and moderate acidity mark the palate. The tart dried-fruit flavors turn somewhat sour on the back end.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese

The palate shows classic but quiet cherry, raspberry and tobacco flavors, while the finish is warm and offers a dash of molasses and balsamic vinegar. Drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo

"Ultra-rich, with the weight and creamy texture of a full-blown Chardonnay, but it's a little too exotically rich and heavy for balance. Although the wine is fully dry, the flavors of pineapple cinnamon buns, butterscotchy toffee and Lifesaver lemons and limes are overwhelming.",US-California:Pinot Blanc
"A first-release from this site, this is a balanced, lightly textured wine, pretty in rose and lavender, with an intriguing shock of white pepper. Baked cherry and plum find companionship in savory clove and cinnamon on the delicate palate.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"An enormously  complex wine, but one that's not quite ready for prime time. Mainly Chardonnay, with 21% Pinot Noir, this was aged on its lees for seven years, giving it a soft creaminess and also an intense, doughy yeastiness. The raspberry, lime, toast and vanilla flavors are rich and slightly honeyed. With brisk acidity and slight scouriness, it wants a good eight years in the cellar, and should age well beyond that.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"From an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria comes this exciting wine. Green and Kalamata olives show on the nose, along with crystallized cherry, juniper, fig, unripe strawberry and Mediterranean spice. It explodes with acidic life on the palate, where underripe cherry and tart strawberry flavors mix with green peppercorns, forest underbrush, wet gravel and thyme.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"There's a light nectarine touch on the nose of this bottling, alongside coconut and Bosc pear aromas and a kiss of oak. It's a tad ripe on the palate, with lemon cream flavors, but compelling acidity, grippy structure and lime pith bitterness all keep it in check.",US-California:Chardonnay
"A fragrant Barolo, showing intense rose and violet aromas with undertones of red fruits and spice. The palate delivers dense dark cherry, white pepper and mint flavors, with a hint of vanilla. It's long and linear but still young, with aggressive tannins that need time to mellow.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"This salmon-colored, no-dosage bubbly is peachy, dusty and yeasty on the nose, with strong whiffs of sulfur and scrambled egg. A clunky, foamy palate comes across as clumsy, while peach and melon flavors are a touch bitter and mealy. Papaya and savory barbecued notes drive the finish, which has a bitter element.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Sparkling Blend
"Mostly Merlot, with a balancing Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a soft, gentle wine, a little simple, but rich and satisfying. And at this price, a bargain for a full-bodied, Bordeaux-style wine.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Crisp-tart tangerine, nectarine and pineapple abound on this fruity, forward Chardonnay. While moderate in body and alcohol, it feels plump and silky on the palate and finishes with a touch of lingering warmth. Drink now through 2020.",US-New York:Chardonnay

"Latex, tire rubber, sauciness, mocha and cotton candy all share the nose, while the palate is forward, a touch scratchy and filled with bold black cherry and plum flavors. Shows some toast and burn on the finish, and overall it's a good Malbec with some mild bite and abrasiveness.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"A deep, dark, robust Lake County Barbera, tame by Barbera standards, with softened tannins but lots of black licorice, fruit—rustic plum, mostly—and a hint of baked bread. Worth a try with meaty pasta dishes.",US-California:Barbera
"Dark tannins and a dense texture give this wine considerably more richness than its alcohol would suggest. It also has black plum and black cherry fruits, layers of spice from wood, and a firm, dry aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"Red fruit aromas, soft tannins and a warm feeling permeate this full, fruity wine. It has an open, generous texture, packed with cherry and red berry flavors and layered with acidity. The wine ends fresh and fruity with a touch of tannin.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Blended with small amounts of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this approachable, accessible and well-made wine is juicy with black fruit and smoky with integrated oak and tannin. Its powerful flavor and robust body ease up on the finish.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A ripe bold wine with generous black fruits, it is a blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc. Dark and concentrated, it brings together rich fruitiness and firm tannins that will allow it to age. Drink from 2018. The wine comes from a vineyard that is currently in biodynamic conversion.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Pérez Cruz makes some nice wines, but this blend of Petit Verdot, Carmenère and Malbec is so full of herbaceous aromas and flavors of juniper, olive and coffee grinds that it's a struggle to get through. Yes, the mouthfeel and structure are that of a serious wine. But the aromas and flavors are so green and mean that it's impossible to rate this blend higher.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Red Blend
"Unusual but enticing, it opens with aromas of smoke, mineral and stone fruit. The savory palate offers yellow peach, golden apple and Bartlett pear accented with notes of clove, nut and nutmeg. It's linear and well-balanced. George Wines, Zancanella.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Friulano

The fresh acidity makes it a perfect match for mildly seasoned cheeses or grilled burgers. Siena Imports, Barsotti Wines.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"91-93 The wine feels full, ripe, weighty. More power than elegance, it shows ripe pear and grapefruit juice flavors. Very dense aftertaste.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Sourced from one of the older vineyards in the region, Mettler has stayed true to Lodi's larger Zinfandel style with Epicenter, a wine that's black as night with notes of dark berry, plum, tar and brick, as well as a hint of tobacco and dark chocolate. Layered and complex, it's full bodied, but retains enough acidity to taste balanced despite its oak and ample alcohol. Enjoy with hearty fare.",US-California:Zinfandel

"For this classic, restrained Cabernet Sauvignon with 11% Petit Verdot, the grapes were grown in Rutherford, Yountville and St. Helena. The wine is juicy in soft red cherry and cassis. Seamless on the palate, it offers a nice progression from explosive fruit to measured acidity and low oak, the finish balanced between all three.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"The composition of this blend is unusual: Syrah and Mourvèdre come with Pinot Grigio and Roussanne. The result is a spicy, raw, green, saucy nose that announces a tannic, pinched palate. Herbal dark-berry flavors are gritty and suggest eucalyptus, while the finish is spicy and green, with hard tannins.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Red Blend

If you are looking for featherlight refreshment, the Grüners from the 2014 vintage will deliver zippy fruit.",Austria-Kamptal:Grüner Veltliner

"Ultraripe black fruits—berries and cherries, along with raisins—reflect the high alcohol.

Spice cake and plum pudding, with heat on the finish, mark this as extreme by previous Fielding Hills standards. Drink soon.",US-Washington:Syrah

"Very sprightly lemon notes sprout from the more rounded apple flavors on nose and palate.

The friendly apple scent makes it a welcome pick-up.",France-Alsace:Sparkling Blend

"Juicy, ripe peach and blossom notes perfume this full bodied blend of Chardonnay, Riesling and Pinot Blanc. It's moderately concentrated, with delicate flavors of fresh stone fruit, pear and toast, but enlivened by a streak of sunny lemon acidity. Finishes briskly.",US-New York:White Blend
"Both dried and juicy red currants form the core of this impressive wine, made in larger quantities with a deft hand. Medium bodied and offering grip and structure, this restrained version of the variety doesn't skimp on flavor.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Although restrained on the nose, this wine leads with lovely, sprightly fresh flavors. Its tannins provide grip and are just a little drying, offsetting the red berry and cherry notes. It's balanced, fresh and moreish in its cherry-toned fruit. Try it with a slight chill.",Austria-Niederösterreich:Zweigelt
"Aromas of candied citrus and bell pepper lead the nose. The firm palate offers toasted oak, baked yellow apple, vanilla and lemon drop, with the warmth of alcohol on the close. Drink sooner rather than later to enjoy the remaining fruit richness.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon
"The aromas seem quite dried out, with notes of blackberry bramble and fruit leather. The flavors also seem considerably more evolved than its age. It's a big miss.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Part of a Limited Release series, this wine includes 17% Syrah, but the varietal character of the Mourvèdre shines through. Light touches of chocolate, clean earth and mineral underscore flavors of plum and cherry. There is also a streak of vanilla, perhaps from aging in French and American oak.",US-Washington:Mourvèdre
"The latest Merlot release from Ethos pushes the alcohol up past 15%, and the wine remains stubbornly closed and tannic, even after several hours of breathing time. Blueberry and cassis fruit are in play, though the tannins take over quickly, leading into a finish with some chalky minerality.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Light apple and earth aromas mingle with crisp fruit flavors without showing much of an oaky component. The wine is medium bodied, fairly crisp in texture and moderate in fruit notes.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This multivineyard blend isn't cheap, but it's almost as good as Farrell's more expensive single-vineyard Pinots, which makes it kind of a value. Like them, it's a dry, crisply acidic wine, and slightly austere. It shows tobacco-infused cherry pie filling, pomegranate, rhubarb and cola flavors.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"This is a full-bodied, creamy-textured Shiraz that manages to retain a sense of poise at the same time.

Drink this plush, supple wine now–2025.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
"This Sangiovese was as usual co-fermented with Syrah (13%), and sourced from a mix of estate vineyards. Smooth and supple, it's a sweetly appealing wine, loaded with strawberry preserves, but also detailed with impressive notes of Italian herbs and a whiff of tomato paste. As befits the variety, the underpinning of natural acidity lifts the finish beautifully, and suggests aging it through 2020.",US-Washington:Sangiovese
"A subdued nose leads to a fresh but also subdued palate, but if you look for the ripe pear notes you will find them. This wine takes time to wake up and breathe but underneath it's an archetypal fresh but rounded Alsace Pinot Blanc.",France-Alsace:Pinot Blanc
"This is the kind of wine only severe lot selection can achieve. The flavors are deep and impressive, ranging from cassis to chocolate. Oak provides smoke and spice. It has that brilliant, velvety texture you expect from wines of this caliber, but, like so many such bottlings, it lacks the acidity to provide backbone.",US-California:Merlot
"Clear and light in color, this dusty smelling Cava offers aromas of briny peach and citrus fruits. The palate is solid, with a round texture and flavors of sulfur, lemon-lime, tangerine and nectarine. A tight, lean finish feels minerally but tastes a bit gaseous.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"Creamy oak aromas shout “vanilla” and “wood resin” in full voice. This is a rough wine with stampeding tannins. Toasty boysenberry flavors are more pounding than elegant, while this tastes of bitter chocolate on an aggressive finish. Give this five years and it may show better but now it's massive and unsettled.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
Exceptionally light feet make this delicate spätlese so quaffable. The palate juxtaposes pristine tangerine and peach flavors against savory notes of saffron and pollen and a high-pitched acidic backbone. It's ready to drink now but should hold well through 2020.,Germany-Rheinhessen:Riesling

The blend includes small portions of Chardonnay, Albariño, Gewürztraminer and Orange Muscat.",US-California:Pinot Grigio
"Plum, blackberry and toasty aromas are pure, heady and classy. Immediately this wine shows itself to be powerful: The tannins are grating and the overall outlook is far from shy.

"Aromas of mature plum, French oak and tilled earth mingle with vanilla and an earthy whiff of game. The scents carry over to the chewy palate along with ripe black cherry, prune, new leather and black pepper. Assertive fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity show the wine's Aglianico pedigree. Drink 2019–2025.",Italy-Southern Italy:Aglianico
"Black in color, this dense wine has power, concentration and a hugely tannic structure. Still in its infancy, it is darkly dominated by its dry, firm texture, the black fruits still hiding behind the framework and the acidity. Give this complex wine until 2018 before drinking.",France-Southwest France:Malbec

"Roasted meats, black fruit, charcoal and tar show on the nose of this clonal selection from this pioneering winery that is now owned by Bill Foley. The medium-bodied sip shows roasted blackberries, boysenberries and black currants, with charred meat leading into a caramelized finish. The acid and tannin levels are solid right now and will age well too.",US-California:Syrah
"With apricot and citrus flavors, this Riesling tastes off-dry, with a honeyed sweetness. It's a little green around the edges, which detracts from the pleasure.",US-California:Riesling
"This ripe Pinot is as sweetly sappy as raspberry syrup. The oak brings additional sweetness, this time of caramel and buttered toast. A little clumsy now, but might gain traction in the cellar.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"The vintage was kind to this bottling, resulting in fabulously ripe flavors of cherry, black raspberry and cola that finish in a swirl of exotic spices. It's a bit heavy and direct in primary fruit, but the acids and tannins are fine, and should allow this wine to age for the next 6–8 years.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Strongly herbal, with thin, very tart, acidic cranberry flavors.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Light and fresh, this carries just a vague hint of barrel toast, but essentially it was done all in stainless.

"This Sangiovese has a lot going for it: a sweet maple-tinged aroma, a pretty ruby color, round but snappy plum and raspberry flavors, and a long, layered finish. But in the end it doesn't really sing, it's a bit hollow at the core, and there's an oak-driven, buttered popcorn note on the finish that leaves a heavy, lasting flavor.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese

"A vineyard-designate since 2007, this wine shows vigor and volatility in the glass, a mix of white pepper, heightened acidity and an underlay of black tea and forest floor. Brooding in dark berry, it never lets the fruit become entirely ripe, opting instead for savory complexity.",US-California:Pinot Noir

A bone-warming wine for fall and winter.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon

"This is a lithe, sinewy wine, powerful yet lean, with coiled intensity to its crisp citrus and mineral flavors. It finishes long and tart, with the bracing acids suggestive of a long evolution. Hold 3–5 years and see if it blossoms.",Germany-Mosel-Saar-Ruwer:Riesling
"An intriguing blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Muscadelle, which highlights the herbaceous Sauvignon character and a more perfumed Muscadelle. The two give a fresh, citrus- and pineapple-flavored wine, lively, to be enjoyed young.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"100% barrel fermented in 50% new French oak, this wine is dominated by flavors of buttered toast, vanilla and butterscotch. Underneath all the oak is a wine that's quite brisk with acidity and a delicious pineapple-jam flavor.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Here's an easy-going Salice Salentino (90% Negroamaro and 10% Malvasia Nera) with spice, cherry and cola notes that are weaved nicely together. There's harmony and elegance here and the wine leaves a spicy imprint on the close.",Italy-Southern Italy:Red Blend
"Il Massiccio is 85% Sangiovese with Merlot and Alicante, opening with bright cherry and raspberry aromas, with sour acidity and a touch of almond. Pair it with pepperoni or sausage pizza.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"A pale copper-pink color, this rosé is light and easygoing, with soft notes of red cherry, strawberry and muddled orange on the nose and mouth. The finish is short, but clean.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon:Rosé
"A great Pavillon Blanc, fine, rich and balanced. From its citrus opening to the final burst of crisp, ripe fruit, this shows the great style of white Bordeaux in 2006. Spice, honey, melon and toast all mingle harmoniously.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This medium-bodied Chardonnay is more restrained than the 2013, but still offers plenty of roasted-cashew toastiness combined with hints of pineapple and guava. The finish is clean and refreshing, but doesn't show the hoped-for length, so drink this over the near term.",Australia-Western Australia:Chardonnay

"A fabulous Pinot Noir that's rich and deeply flavored, with the most wonderful structure. After a fruity, spicy entry, the wine sinks down dramatically on the midpalate, offering masses of cherries, raspberries, red currants, cured meats, sautéed mushrooms, spices and sweetly toasted sandalwood. Bone dry, and capable of aging eight years in the cellar, it surpasses even the 2007 West Slope, arguably making it one of the greatest Carneros Pinot Noirs ever made.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Intense aromas of peach and lemon-lime are softened by notes of concrete and flint. On the palate, there is a muskiness that is eventually overpowered by guava, peach and sour apple, finishing tart.",US-Virginia:White Blend
"Starts out with gassy, earthy aromas that suggest heat and barnyard, while the palate is chunky and full, with stemmy black cherry, plum and berry flavors along with coffee and chocolate accents. Delivers power and length but not much in the way of character or complexity.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tinta de Toro
"A very nice Cabernet-based wine from Dominus, the '05 Napanook is a shade less elegant than in the last few vintages, but is still a lush, attractive young wine. Filled with the flavors of ripe blackberries, black currants, tar, chocolate, cedar and pepper, its tannins are hard and a little astringent. Give it a few years or serious decanting.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A bright magenta color and aromas of toast, tobacco, cola and wild blackberry draw you in. This wine is young, and so the acidity shows through right now. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and black cherry come with a touch of oaky vanilla. That vanilla carries over to the finish, which is oaky, bright and scouring. This Carignan-Garnacha blend will be at its best from 2018–2024.",Spain-Catalonia:Red Blend

"Leafy cassis and cocoa aromas and flavors carry hints of almond paste, saddle leather and ground cinnamon. The mouthfeel is full and plush, with ripe tannins that coat the mouth and let you know that this wine is about more than up-front fruit. Drink now or anytime over the next five years.",Chile-Curicó Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Saucy aromas are more earthy and herbal than fruity and rich. This feels chunky, clunky and tannic, while flavors of blackened spices, herbal berry fruits and tomato sauce finish tannic but also low on acidity.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tinto Fino
"This is a blend of five Colheita vintages, the oldest 1981, the youngest 1992. It has many of the characters of a single vintage Colheita with one exception: it is fresher, retaining a surprising and impressive amount of fruit. The wood aging has left the wine rich and spicy with just a hint of dryness. Drink this wine now.",Portugal-Port:Port
"Smoky, earthy and refined on the nose, this Cab is showing a seamless mix of berry and oak-based aromas. Full, moderately tannic, layered and thorough on the palate, this tastes of baked berry fruits, integrated oak and loamy earth. A ripe yet balanced finish indicates that aging is needed. Drink through 2025.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Spearmint, plum, oak, and menthol aromas take shape in the glass. The dense palate shows ripe plum, espresso, vanilla and licorice alongside bracing tannins. Give this time to unwind. Drink after 2018.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese

"This wine offers more power and heat on the palate than would be expected given the listed alcohol by volume, a hammering of huge tannins holding the fruit hostage. An unpleasant fish-sauce aroma mars the nose.",US-California:Zinfandel
"With small percentages of Syrah and Viognier, this Petite Sirah is simple and has a pronounced smoky personality.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"There's a touch of ripe fruit followed by prune and dark tobacco. This Nero d'Avola is smooth and soft on the palate, with a touch of ripe fruit, plus notes of prune and dark tobacco. It would pair well with spicy chicken wings.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nero d'Avola

It's big, full bodied, fresh and powerful, and an excellent value.",US-Oregon:Riesling
"Strikes of lime cut through rich honey and tangerine flavors in this dry, revitalizing Riesling. Hints of smoked nuts, pollen and dusty mineral lend savory complexity to the midpalate, but the finish is pristine and perfumed, lingering on a lovely honeysuckle note.",US-New York:Riesling

"Made entirely from estate fruit, and given time to settle in French oak puncheons, only a third of them new, this dry and complex white is easily quaffable and yet so much more. Citrus peel and dried herb complement on the nose and palate, with a lightness of being that never veers on frivolous.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Grapy aromas seem simple at first, but with time tarry black plum and citrus peel notes emerge. This is very tannic, arguably a bit too much so. Plum, blackberry and chocolate flavors end with a reverb of hard tannins. For best results, give this as much air as possible.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Malbec may well be the next red grape to emerge as a star in Washington State, once the young vines have a few more vintages behind them. This is 100% varietal. Light and elegant, it's nicely detailed with a peppery, floral character and a welcome persistence. Take the best qualities of Beresan's Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Syrah and mix them into a single, more delicate varietal, and you have this lovely Malbec, which glides along to a finish with chocolaty, satiny tannins.",US-Washington:Malbec

Drink through 2025.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese

A tight, toasty tasting finish is minty, drying and a bit high in acid.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon

The floral and rose petal scents of the grape are nicely rendered but not overwhelming, and the 1% RS residual sugar is almost invisible given the juicy fruit and acids.",US-Oregon:Gewürztraminer
"Cidery aromas suggest sourdough bread and citrus. This cava feels raw and clipped, with little to no friendliness to the palate. Briny, cidery flavors finish with a funky pickled aftertaste.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend

Add huge depth and intensity and you have the criteria for a cellar-worthy wine. Will be ready to drink after 2020.,Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"This crisp, clean, lightly herbal wine has apple and grapefruit flavors that come through intense acidity. Bright with ripe fruit, the wine is ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Pretty dark for a rosé, and heavy and rich, too. Tastes like a raspberry Newton cookie.",US-California:Rosé
"Pineapple and lemon cream pie converge on this viscous, deep-yellow blend of Chardonnay and Roussanne, made by urban winemaker Matthias Pippig on Santa Barbara's Eastside. There is an emergent acidity on the palate, powered by nectarine, but it's nicely dense and rich.",US-California:White Blend
There's an odd note of jammy fruit and cherry tomato on the bouquet that is followed by disjointed notes of raspberry and pear. A touch of bitter almond appears on the close.,Italy-Tuscany:Rosato
"Already mature, this is a rich and opulent wine that blends together toast and secondary-fruit aromas with fresh, lively acidity. It has weight and substantial depth and concentration. It should age well for another few years, but this impressive wine can be drunk now as well.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Jean Lissague, one of Bordeaux wine's “new generation,” produced the 100% Merlot with spice and firm tannins. It also has weight and richness from the generous fruitiness. Drink this structured wine starting from 2019.",France-Bordeaux:Merlot
"With a swirl, this wine's enticing new leather, eucalyptus, woodland berry and herb aromas unfold in the glass. The taut and savory palate offers sour cherry, crushed strawberry, star anise and white pepper notes. Refined tannins and firm acidity provide balance while a hint of coffee signals the close. Drink 2020–2029.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"From a beautiful vintage on the relatively cooler end of the valley, this wine combines 89% Cabernet Sauvignon with 7% Petit Verdot and 4% Cabernet Franc. Cedar, herb and savory sage open into a strong element of forest floor and rose garden. Tight firm tannin wrap around a robust ripeness that finds balance in accompanying acidity. Enjoy from 2024–2034.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine is überaromatic, with notes of raspberry jam, stemmy herbs, blackberries, smoked meat, orange peel, iron and an earthy funk. The palate brings a lot of intensity of flavor, with smoke and orange-peel notes lingering on the warm finish.",US-Washington:Syrah
"The price is right for this lush, immediately attractive Shiraz from Victoria. Smoky, vanilla-scented oak frames black currant and tobacco flavors that finish soft and velvety. Lacks the depth to age past 2010, but very flattering now. Imported by Epic Wines.",Australia-Victoria:Shiraz
"The Arinto grape and the town of Bucelas go together. This small enclave in the larger Lisboa region produces this crisp fruity style, like a southern version of dry Vinho Verde but with extra weight. Drink this attractive, lemon and red-apple flavored wine now.",Portugal-Bucelas:Arinto
"Even if you like some earthy, mushroomy notes in your Syrah, this one is unripe to the point of vegetal. It's also too soft for balance. Despite some decent blackberry and cola flavors, it's a real disappointment.",US-California:Syrah
"Rosy cherry and plum aromas turn more rubbery and raisiny as this airs out. Solid, lifted and deep on the palate, this varietal Garnacha deals lightly herbal, floral flavors of plum and cherry cough drop, while the finish is oaky, resiny, raw, scouring and tough. Nothing about this is subtle or elegant, but it is dynamic. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Catalonia:Garnacha
This example shows a bit more character than many Pays d'Oc Chardonnays. Pretty scents of lemon and honeysuckle lead to a palate with above-average concentration and lovely lemon meringue pie flavors. Tangy acidity renders this a good choice for salmon.,France-Languedoc-Roussillon:Chardonnay
"The main thing to know about this blend of undisclosed varieties is that it's not dry. It will appeal to consumers who like their white wines fruity and sugary, yet it's not really sweet enough to enjoy as a dessert sipper.",US-California:White Blend
"Intense aromas of rose, iris, perfumed berry and eucalyptus lead the way on this radiant wine. The vibrant palate offers juicy wild cherry, raspberry, grilled sage, menthol and dark kitchen spice while firm, fine-grained tannins provide the framework.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Light as a feather yet bold in fruit, this sprightly spätlese packs a punch of sweet, ripe apricot, peach and even raspberry flavors. Spine tingling grapefruit acidity lends vitality, guiding a breathlessly perfumed, floral finish. It's a thrilling, irresistible wine.",Germany-Rheingau:Riesling
"This comes from a dry-farmed site, all the better to coax out its stony minerality and delicate aromas of rose garden an d geranium. Fully expressive, it's voluptuous and lushly balanced, offering wild strawberry and tons of forest floor.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A grippy, ink-staining, concentrated Charbono from the Santa Clara Valley, made from 90% estate-grown Charbono (the vineyard is in San Martin) and 10% Syrah. Two years spent in French oak might explain its minty, cedar highlights, rounded out by black cherry and plum.",US-California:Charbono
"This is a delicious wine that's ready to drink while keeping a good sense of its austere structure. It has weight, richness and a juicy black-fruit character. The finish is bright with acidity. Not for aging.",France-Provence:Rhône-style Red Blend
"The winery's Vintage Select Cabernet was famous in its day as one of California's greatest and most long-lived. It's not entirely clear why they changed the name to Vintage Selection, but this is still a very good wine. Ripe, succulent currant fruit and a soft mouthfeel are the highlights, seconded by complexity, dryness and a gentle application of new French oak. So gently appealing now, it's drinkable, and should develop for 6–10 years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of black-skinned berry, scorched soil and bell pepper lead the nose. The dense dark palate delivers juicy black plum, tobacco and clove framed in chewy tannins. Enjoy through 2020.",Italy-Central Italy:Sangiovese
"This is one of the more interesting rosés of the vintage, in part because it is almost as hay-colored as a white wine and doesn't adhere to the standard pink profile. Aromas of crushed Marcona almonds, sea salt and oak smoke show on the nose, and the acid-driven palate continues that nutty and smokey drive. It's intriguing and unique, though not particularly pink.",US-California:Rosé
"Quite a good wine. It's luscious in creamy flavors of blackberries, cherries and toast, and also beautifully balanced. You feel the elegant interplay of oak, tannins and acidity. Should develop over the next 6–8 years.",US-California:Red Blend
"Plum and berry aromas are lively and come with a mild scent of animal fur. This blend of four grapes, led by Tempranillo, feels blocky and loosely defined, while flavors of plum, raspberry and a touch of herbal green finish spicy and woody. Will function best as an everyday wine.",Spain-Central Spain:Red Blend
"Plum and raspberry aromas grace a simple but clean bouquet. This Toro is lively on the palate, with high acidity that's reflective of a cool, wet vintage. Plum, currant and earthy, herbal flavors end with grabby tannins and zesty acidity. Drink through 2018.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tinta de Toro
"This aptly expresses the characteristics of wines from the McMinnville AVA. A steely, peppery, gun-metal streak runs up and down the spine, with tight, compact blue and black fruits, ripping acidity, firm tannins and a light suggestion of root beer. It's all in place in a wine that seems destined for a life of two decades or longer.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Pinot Meunier is seldom bottled on its own. Vintners prefer to use it in sparkling wine blends. But Bouchaine is serious about it, and with this 100% varietal wine, has succeeded in producing a Pinot Noir-esque wine of great beauty. With some new French oak, it has a smoky edge to the raspberries and cherries, with savory hints of white pepper and cinnamon.",US-California:Pinot Meunier
"This unique Syrah vineyard is located at the northwestern edge of the Columbia Valley AVA. Exotic, silky and compelling, the aromas and flavors combine gorgeously sleek berry fruit flavors with a foundation of liquid rock (hence the vineyard name). Supple, authoritative and long, it gathers both strength and subtlety as it breathes.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Ripe yet deftly balanced, this full-bodied wine offers an abundance of blackberry fruitiness balanced by tones of granite and dried herb. It's sumptuous and expansive on the palate, finishing long with fine, sharply edged tannins.",US-New York:Merlot
"Oily, salinic aromas of match stick and pickled white fruits offer up a pinched palate with briny, stalky flavors of burnt orange and passion fruit. A briny tasting, clampy finish doesn't do much to bring this around.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"This blend of the two classic grapes of Vinho Verde, Loureiro and Alvarinho, is packed with fruit. Apples, lemons and a touch of ripe pear just fill the palate. It is a dry wine, refreshing and crisp with a mineral aftertaste.",Portugal-Vinho Verde:Portuguese White
"Bright aromas of plum, herb and abundant wood spices are followed by plump, fresh dark fruit and barrel flavors backed by a light grip of gritty tannins.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A distinctly different Prosecco with a colorful aromatic lineup that sets it apart: Yellow fruit, green tea, white stone and nutty almond (10% Chardonnay is added). It delivers a clean, crunchy texture and sweet peach flavors.",Italy-Veneto:Prosecco
"Almost black in color, this is a dark-hued, black plum and chocolate flavored wine. It is powerful and very concentrated, densely tannic as well as fruity. There is a dusty texture, a fine stratum of acidity and strong wood-spice flavors. The wine is for long-term aging. Drink from 2017.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"The aromas of this rosé of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc are direct and reminiscent of red currant jam on toast. Medium bodied and broad in feel, this has acids that offer plenty of cut, plus a touch of grapefruit zest that adds interest.",US-Virginia:Rosé
"Elegantly structured and savory, this offers aromas of white field flower, orchard fruit and chopped herb. Boasting depth and finesse, the bright, juicy palate delivers mature pear, tangerine zest and flinty mineral alongside fresh acidity that lifts the creamy flavors.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Grigio
"This eccentric blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah, Merlot, and Sangiovese achieves unusual finesse and complexity for a Paso Robles red wine.

Tannins are soft and plump.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Baked boysenberries, purple flowers and baking spice show on the nose of this widely available bottling. The palate is quite minerally, with crushed lava rocks, followed by cooked elderberry, black-cherry pie and a touch of clove.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A short wood-aging has given this wine an extra dimension that's both ripe and ageworthy. Yellow fruits are spiced up by the toast and ginger flavors, whlle intense background acidity provides wonderful freshness. This wine deserves to age. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Stout aromas of ripe blackberry and cassis come with mocha and dry spice notes on the nose of this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon blend. A firm mouthfeel with grinding tannins is a good set up to oaky, ripe berry flavors accented by wood grain, cocoa and cinnamon notes. Plenty of oak graces a long, ripe, solid finish. Drink through 2018.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend shows the ripe, exuberantly friendly type of red wine Paso Robles excels at. While it's filled with sweet cherries and currants, it has a good structure of acids and tannins for balance. The alcohol is pretty high, but the wine wears the heat well.",US-California:Red Blend
"Luscious, almost heaving with ripeness and alcoholic warmth, this dry-style kabinett is no shrinking violet. Its rich peach and melon flavors and bold, unabashed style are seductive though. Dense and mouthfilling, it will drink well through 2020.",Germany-Rheingau:Riesling
This is a crisp and dry Champagne. Its attractive red fruits are linked to the acidity and tight texture to give a linear wine that is refreshing and has a bright aftertaste. Drink now.,France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Guigal's 2009 entry-level Côte Rôtie comes across as a bit austere. Cool scents of crushed stone and black olive mark the nose, while the palate is firm and tight, only slowly giving up hints of espresso. Drink 2018–2024.",France-Rhône Valley:Syrah
"Cherry aromas are firm and don't evolve much in the glass. This is intense on the palate, with strong acidity that lends tartness to sinewy plum and berry flavors. Minor accents of spice and toast finish with espresso bitterness. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"This is a less outwardly aromatic interpretation of Sauvignon with measured notes of exotic fruit, kiwi and lime. The wine is lean and compact in the mouth but does a very good job of keeping the palate clean.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon
"The mature vines in the name of the wine are 40-years-old. The result is a firm structured wine although one with plenty of soft red fruits in the background. They are developing well, bringing with them acidity and good potential. Drink this wine from 2018.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"A selection from parcels of vines in the La Rochelle section of Moulin à Vent, this wine comes from one of top recent vintages in Beaujolais. It is rich and packed with mature fruit. There are acidity, integrated tannins and secondary flavors of juicy acidity and smokiness. It is ready to drink. Owner Jean-Jacqus Parinet left the IT world for wine and bought Château Moulin-à-Vent in 2009 and Bief in 2012.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Apricot and peach aromas lead the way in this still-tight, mineral wine. Its richness is drawn up at this stage, showing crisp acidity as well as honey and pineapple flavors. It's likely to age well, so drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Made from the local Sciaccarellu grape, this is a delicious, light and perfumed wine. It has tight acidity to go with the red currant flavors and the crisp texture. The wine is poised and refreshing.",France-France Other:Rosé
Way too sweet and soft to qualify as a dry table wine. Okay for big parties where everyone's drinking happily from paper cups.,US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Disjointed, sharp, astringent and thin, this shows little of the varietal character usually associated with grapes from the outstanding Destiny Ridge vineyard. There's a whiff of funk in the nose, but only tart, generic and unripe fruit in the mouth.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Toasted hazelnut, beeswax, chamomile, sea breeze and citrus zest aromas carry over to the bright, medium-bodied palate, along with flinty mineral and pear notes. A warm honey tone anchors the linear finish.",Italy-Southern Italy:Fiano
"Good on the nose, with solid raspberry and nectarine aromas. The palate is spunky and alert, with juicy red-cherry, rhubarb and integrated spice flavors. It's mostly a clean, basic, easy-to-drink bubbly, but it's persistent, harmonious and commendable. Pinot Noir with Trepat is the grape mix.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend

"Soft, bitter and overripe, with raisin, mocha and Port flavors. It's a Rhône-style blend.",US-California:Red Blend
"Dark-colored and deeply fruity, this medium-bodied wine tastes like Bing cherry juice and black plums, and feels plush rather than tannic on the palate.",US-California:Red Blend
"This is still tightly closed: There are merely some notions of iron oxide on the nose, but otherwise this is brooding and mysterious. The palate, however, has something majestic and sumptuous about it—a warm heart of ripe and aromatic black and red cherry. This just needs to breathe and will unfurl like crimson velvet on your tongue. While this can be approached now as it is beginning to mellow, this will be even better in the years leading up to 2020. Very moreish.",Austria-Burgenland:Blaufränkisch
"Aromas of rubber, toasted herb and desiccated dark fruit are quite mute and reticent. On the palate, the structural elements are prominent, with juicy acids and astringent tannins framing the dark berry flavor.",US-Virginia:Red Blend
"White-fruit aromas, brine and clam shell notes get this Albariño going. The mouthfeel is full and lemony. Flavors of pickled, briny citrus and nectarine carry onto the finish. This is at its best now; in 2014 it will not be so good.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño
"The nose is a bit soapy and medicinal with aromas of violets candies, mushy black cherry and a touch of acetone. The mouth offers more high toned fruit flavors with a sharp, skinny finish. Drink now.",South Africa-Stellenbosch:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Cabernet hardly gets richer or riper than this. The wine offers a huge blast of ripe and concentrated blackberries, cherries, cassis and mocha.

Lovely to drink now, and will develop over the next 10-plus years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This offers plenty of tannins and a dry, firm structure along with the weight of ripe plums, blackberries and a rich character. The wine is certainly going to age, with its solid texture and bold fruit aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Smells oaky, with smoky vanilla and sweet, charred notes riding high over flamboyant tropical fruit aromas, including guavas and breadfruit. This is a big wine, but the pieces aren't all in place. It's like a symphony orchestra playing different tunes. Give it a few months to knit together.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay

"Aaron Jackson sources from the Central Coast's most extremely coastal vineyards, and this one from Edna Valley shows complex cola, black cherry, star anise and Dr Pepper aromas.

"There is lots of garrigue and purple flower elements to the nose of this bottling, with hints of vanilla and cola against the dark red fruit base. The thyme, sage and marjoram touches come through on the sip as well, decorating the sweeter red cherry fruit.",US-California:Grenache
"This new wine from an estate vineyard is the strong, quiet type that's not effusively fruity but instead emphasizes mineral elements and great structure. An attractive chalky, spicy aroma leads to beautifully restrained red cherry and pomegranate flavors that seem to grow and expand with each sip. The texture is firmly tannic but also polished, supported by perfect acidity that keeps everything sharp and focused.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Fonréaud's vineyard is on the highest point of the Médoc (all of 120 feet). This vintage shows a smooth, ripe wine full of juicy black fruits. It's not dense, and the fruitiness will let it age relatively quickly. Drink this attractive wine from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A tasty, juicy wine with ripe red cherry fruit and lively acidity. Soft, beautifully ripe, ready to drink.",Austria-Burgenland:Zweigelt

"This wine starts out quite reductive but opens to reveal aromas of fig and citrus. It drinks off dry, with the flavors seeming dilute.",US-Washington:Sémillon

"Although there's a lot of ripe blackberry jam, black currant and chocolate flavors, it's a little on the simple side. Ready to drink now.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"With 39% Petit Verdot, this is a rarity in Bordeaux. It is certainly reflected in the dark color of the wine. It has spice and a densely concentrated structure, firm and chunky.

"A barrel-selection, top-of-the-line cuvée, this is intensely aromatic with black cherry, soft leather and baking spices in play.

"A mellow touch of ripe Red Delicious apple hovers on the nose. The palate brims with rich fruit, showing candied pear and dried apple. This richness is countered by a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge and a pure streak of fresh zestiness. A touch of sandalwood and cinnamon adds spice around the edges.

"A chunky, thick, earthy type of wine with syrupy, sweet berry flavors and a friendly palate that's tannic but not too much so. Caramel and carob mix with coffee and cola on the finish, and overall it is good RDD if you don't mind full extraction and syrupy richness.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"This is no ordinary Vinho Verde. With its rich Alvarinho flavors, it is a wine that can be aged. The mouthfeel is full in green plum and ripe apricot flavors, and textured by a great swathe of fresh, tangy citrus. It can be drunk now, although it will be better from 2016.",Portugal-Vinho Verde:Alvarinho
"A blend of 44% Syrah, 31% Grenache and 25 Mourvèdre, this wine is aromatically very pure, with plenty of red and blue fruit, speckled with bay leaf, herb and black-pepper accents. It possesses a thrilling plush mouthfeel, with olive and black-fruit flavors, showing a fine sense of purity.",US-Washington:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Lots of red flowers, from roses to hibiscus, show alongside plump candied red cherries, exotic Asian spice, black tea and hearty chaparral herbs on the nose of this bottling. The palate is heavy with bay leaf, thyme and eucalyptus served atop a strawberry-cherry base. It's earthy and herbal, yet redolent with ripeness.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This Rhône-style blend—two-thirds Roussanne, the rest divided between Marsanne and Viognier—was made using grapes sourced from the estate Destiny Ridge Vineyard. Intriguing aromas suggest clover, sweet grass and honeysuckle, while the flavors run from stone fruits into hints of light tropical fruits. It's lovely and evocative.",US-Washington:Rhône-style White Blend
"A very well-done Livermore Cab aged in 100% Hungarian oak and named “The Good Life,” this one's got plum and spicy cola going on and tastes young though it's a 2008. Its structure shows more potential to age—the fruit will integrate with the wine's subtle savory herbs.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of maple and sweet hickory smoke emerge through the waves of purple fruit and lilacs on the nose of this small-batch blend of 52% Grenache, 27% Syrah and 21% Mourvèdre. The flavors are well integrated on the sip, with tangy boysenberry, a pinch of sage and crushed black-pepper spice, with a strong acidity that rises in the midpalate.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is straightforward, no-frills Garnacha with plum and berry aromas followed by a tight, slightly tannic palate that houses raspberry and plum flavors. The finish is smooth for the most part, with some heat and herbal flavors.",Spain-Northern Spain:Garnacha
"This leads with mocha, herb and leather aromas. The palate is still tight and closed but offers red berry, clove and sage hints with some air. Clenched tannins grip the close.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Dry and crisply detailed, this delicious, bracing Riesling combines refreshing minerality with delicate yet complex fruit flavors of apple, pear and tangerine. It's full-bodied and drinking beautifully, but has the structure to develop over a decade or more. You decide whether to enjoy it now or tuck it away.",US-Washington:Riesling
"For a rosé that was bottled more than two years ago, this is showing well. Citrus and bath soap aromas announce briny flavors of orange and tangerine. A tart, monotone finish holds steady. Drink immediately.",Spain-Northern Spain:Rosé
"Orange blossoms, lemon juice, honeydew melon and a nearly guava element show on the topical nose of this slightly sweet wine. The palate offers orange and lime juice flavors, with sour and bitter sides to cut the sweetness. Expect this to age well and show even better in the years to come.",US-California:Riesling
"This is crisp, bright, and apple-flavored, it's a lively and fragrant blend of Muscat, Riesling and Pinot Gris. There is great acidity, plus a spicy, aromatic element and a crisp, floral finish. Screwcap.",France-Alsace:White Blend
"Dark-hued wine, dominated by acidity as well as firm tannins. It shows solid, chunky structure, ripe fruit and plenty of sweetness. Of course, there is acidity as well, the charm of Gamay coming through in the fresh cherry flavors. Age 2–3 years.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"This is a wine with strong earthy aromas. Its structure is dense and hard at this young stage, but there is enough weight of barnyard and black plum flavors to balance the dry tannins. While it feels rustic, it will certainly develop and soften out. Drink from 2016.",Portugal-Dão:Portuguese Red
"A good, rather rugged wine. It's edgy in tannins and somewhat overripe, with raisin, plum, blackberry, coffee and spice flavors. But it's nicely dry. Zinfandel, Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot.",US-California:Red Blend
"The flavors in this kosher wine are very rich, commingling tangerines, ripe peaches, and mangoes for a thoroughly mouth-filling experience. Oak adds smoky, spicy notes. ItÕs a bit sweet, and could use more bright acid because itÕs too soft right through the finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This soft wine is very fruity, with banana and red cherry flavors, and very drinkable now. It has a bright feel to it, from the acidity and from the light, jaunty texture. Drink now.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Opening with aromas of plum, leather, chocolate and oak, this bold wine is dense and extracted. The palate delivers prune, dried cherry marinated in spirits, licorice, grilled sage and black pepper. There's not enough fruit richness to support the wood tannins that leave an astringent finish.",Italy-Veneto:Red Blend
"Striking and sincere Sauvignon Blanc. One whiff, one taste and one swish across the palate and you'll know that this is elevated stuff. For starters, the bouquet delivers honest bell pepper, melon, passion fruit and apple aromas; and along with the fruit there's nuance, structure and balancing herbal notes. Full, long and regal. Drink now to capture this wine's powerful essence.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
There's a deep smoky element here that is offset by bright tones of cherry and blackberry. This is a wine that would pair beautifully at an outdoor barbecue with hamburgers and baby back ribs.,"Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Harvested late but not sweet, this decadently rich and fruity wine pairs well with cheese or an equally opulent dish such as osso bucco or red wine risotto. It has grapey, jammy aromas and late-picked flavors like fig, plum and black raisin that glide along the palate. The alcohol is high, tempered by a velvety texture and moderate tannins.",US-California:Zinfandel
"All stainless steel fermented using Dijon clones. A clean, delicate style, but with an elegant touch and nuances of honey, clove. Very well balanced and textured, with a light but long progression of flavors.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"A lean wine with green fruit flavors, this is made drinkable by its balance between fruit and the dry core of tannins. The wine should be drunk now.",Portugal-Douro:Touriga Nacional
"The opening of green apple and honeydew melon says Rueda all the way. The feel is cleansing and fresh, with piercing but proper acidity pushing flavors of green citrus, melon and green apple. Stony on the finish, with zest. Solid for near-term drinking; don't let it sit around for long.",Spain-Northern Spain:Verdejo
"This structured wine is bold with its tannins and dry cherry-pit flavor. It is dense, its stalky acidity and red-plum flavors backed by a dry core. It's a concentrated wine that needs to age, so drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley:Cabernet Franc
"Dry, spicy berry aromas are pedestrian but fine. This is tight, fresh and a touch scraping on the palate, with plum, currant and roasted flavors. Spicy, minty and solid on the finish, this is a perfectly good Merlot with limitations.",Chile-Curicó Valley:Merlot
"The nose doesn't give much away while the full-bodied, straightforward palate offers fleshy black cherry marinated in spirits and a hint of cooking spice. Tightly wound but fleeting tannins provide the framework. It's brawny but simple.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"A blend of Sangiovese (38%), Merlot (31%) and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine displays each in turn with aromas and flavors of dried herbs, coffee, tobacco and cherry. The style is reserved, with plenty of fruit and acid but subtle oak—perfect for the dinner table.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"This bold, firm wine strikes a fine balance between structure and ripe black plum fruit. It has dense tannins that indicate it needs time. A blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Franca, it will be ready from 2018.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"A fine Otis Cab, from Columbia's now departed winemaking team of David Lake and Robert Takahashi. It's rich and deep, scented with a luscious mix of fresh herbs. The fruit has a pleasing spiciness, sweet plum and cassis threaded with anise and sage. There seems to be more fruit concentration and less of the green, peppery character that Otis can bring in some vintages, but even now this is a very young wine (it was released in June of 2008) that should reward another few years of cellaring.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"As with many wines from brothers Martin and Mathieu Béraut, this is a blend of many grapes. The combination produces a typical herbal grassy wine, full of tangy citrus fruit and with a touch of apricot from the Petit Manseng in the blend. Drink this now.",France-Southwest France:White Blend
"The small quantities of St Laurent produced in Austria show the grape's great potential. This is a very fruity wine with a dry core and fine sense of structure. Full of red fruits, spice and tannin, it's likely to age for 2–4 years.",Austria-Burgenland:St. Laurent
"Erath makes a solid, reliable, all-purpose but somewhat generic Oregon Pinot Noir. This blended wine fills a desperate need for something that can represent good old basic Oregon Pinot Noir. It's accessible and spicy, with clean and tangy red fruits. A bit sharp and acidic, it should improve over the next couple of years as it softens out.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Here's a Prosecco Brut that stands tall in this category of sparkling wine thanks to the pristine and intense nature of its bouquet. You'll get dusty mineral, fruit and flowers and the mouthfeel is exceedingly crisp and clean.",Italy-Veneto:Glera
"The rather closed nose gives little away. The palate, however, is full of juicy stone fruit. Think ripe mirabelle and apricot, think juicy tangerine and orange. This is full of fruit and tension, highlighted with lemon freshness and a lovely streamlined taut palate. The long finish has something of fresh apples about it.",Austria-Wachau:Riesling
"Here's a riserva Brunello that opens with inky, dark concentration and tertiary aromas of graham cracker, dried carob powder and ripe berry fruit. The wine shows a dusty, powdery side that makes it appear older than it really is. Black currant, cured meat and leather appear on the close. Drink now.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Bold berry and black-cherry aromas come with equal amounts of overt oak and coconut scents. This has hard but manageable tannins that create a powerful but rocky mouthfeel. Flavors of coconut, vanilla, blackberry and chocolate finish with firm, dry tannins, fresh acidity and a lasting mocha flavor. Drink through 2022.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"This is a dry wine, with hints of yeast as well as spice and nutmeg flavors. The fruit is well integrated into this mix of flavors, giving a ripe wine that is ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux:Rosé
"Woodsy and thickly textured, this Weir Pinot is balanced in just-ripe cherry goodness that neatly scrapes the edge of sour-ness. Fine earth and herbal overtones show off its varietal qualities, more typical of its warmer climate than the Deep End of Anderson Valley.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Sweet pipe tobacco and red cherry open the nose of this plush Syrah from Maremma, Tuscany. Soft, chewy tannins make this inky red wine appropriate to pair with grilled porcini mushrooms or veal in cream sauce.",Italy-Tuscany:Syrah
"Aromas of black currant, cedar, eucalyptus and dried Mediterranean herbs lead the nose of this full-bodied blend of 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 5% Merlot. On the structured but polished palate, notes of dark chocolate, black pepper and anise accent the juicy black cherry core. It's richly textured and balanced with velvety tannins.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend

"Plum and candied berry aromas come with a touch of horseradish and chemical harshness. Chunky, plump and short on crispness, this tastes of plum, berry and salt. A bready tasting finish runs low on acidity and fruit.",Spain-Northern Spain:Rosé
"Herbaceous and brambly on the nose and palate, Wölffer's Estate Merlot is concentrated in red plum and cherry fruit but lean in structure, with lively acidity and a softly tannic finish. It drinks well now, but it could benefit from decanting.",US-New York:Merlot
"Blended with 5% Sémillon, this crisp, tropical white is generous with bright acidity and a strong taste of pineapple and lemon. Zippy minerality adds a stoniness to the texture and flavor, as a fresh-cut grass note lingers in the background.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Basic but in the best possible way. The nose is familiar, clean and inviting due to licorice, sweet black fruit and smoky aromas. Fresh in the mouth, with bright acidity pumping up berry, cassis and herbal flavors. Composed on the finish, with a high level of competence.",Chile-Central Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Tight, light and crisp, this is a great aperitif wine, all white fruits, citrus and layers of minerality. The aftertaste is vibrant with the acidity. Glass stopper.",Austria-Kamptal:Grüner Veltliner

"Steely lemon and low oak star in this unfussy wine, which remains light bodied in spirit despite a rich finish of marshmallow and vanilla.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This brut nature is citric and bubbly on the palate after opening with aromas of weeds and spring onion. Flavors of lemon, herbs, onion and mustard coalesce in front of a bitter finish.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"Tri is actually a blend of four grapes – Syrah, Dolcetto, Cabernet Sauvignon and Mourvèdre. Maybe should be renamed Quad? It's soft and fruity, and the unusual mix of grapes resolves into an easy-drinking, all-purpose, but somewhat diffuse, generic red.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"This intensely ripe wine is made predominantly from Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of Malbec and Merlot. Its waxy cherry, currant and blueberry flavers are laced wtih milk chocolate and smoky oak richness, a dash of high-toned acidity sparking on the finish.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"With light touches of wood aging, this delicate, honeyed wine has all the poise and style of Jurançon, in the foothills of the Pyrénées mountains. Lightly stepping between freshness and rich, ripe, sweet fruitiness, the wine is full of apricot, sweet apple and lime acidity. It is delicious, but it would be a shame for the taste Sébastien and Isabelle Bordenave-Coustarret created not to age it, so drink from 2019.",France-Southwest France:Gros and Petit Manseng
"Lush flavors of cherry jam, red currants and licorice are enhanced with new French oak to make this wine softly delicious. A few drops of other red varieties, including Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, add to its structure and depth.",US-California:Merlot

"Vineyards in the upper Douro Superior region are able to produce surprisingly fresh and fruity whites like this, despite the heat and dry climate. Old vines go into this yellow and green fruit flavored wine with its lively acidity and totally refreshing palate. Drink from summer 2016.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese White
"Mature black plum, tobacco, crushed violet, cake spice and toast aromas mingle together in the glass. The taut full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherry, prune, espresso, orange peel and licorice alongside a backbone of close-grained tannins. This is still extremely young and tightly wound, so give it time to fully develop. Drink 2019–2029.",Italy-Veneto:Red Blend
"Light and charming, this slips into gear gently and then surprises with some tannic grip. Flavors combine root beer and strawberry highlights. For Willamette Valley Pinot Noir, it offers exceptional value.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"A superb value, this wine's weighty presence and rich texture convey the warmth of the Barossa without ever stepping over into overripeness. Instead, it delivers mixed berry fruit, peppery spice and overtones of vanilla and chocolate. Drink now and over the next few years.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz

"Wood takes center stage on this wine. Char, dark roasted coffee, chocolate and vanilla are followed by sweet fruit and oak flavors backed by firm, dry tannins.",US-Washington:Petite Sirah
"Surprisingly dry and crisp for a Dry Creek Valley Viognier. Usually these wines are fatter and sweeter, but not this one. It's streamlined and elegant, with savory apricot, Meyer lemon and slightly underripe white peach flavors. A nice food wine as an alternative to Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio.",US-California:Viognier
"Aromas of underbrush, porcini mushroom, scorched earth and prune lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The concentrated palate offers blueberry extract and black plum, while notes of mocha and black pepper add depth.

"Distinctive aromas of beeswax and bee pollen continue with similar flavors, wrapped around tart yellow apple fruit. It's lovely, fragrant and ageworthy, in a high-acid Euro mold, but give it plenty of time to breathe. Decanting is a good idea.",US-Oregon:Pinot Blanc
"Black cherry and cassis aromas are bold but basic. This feels fiercely tannic and astringent. Meaty flavors of cherry and black plum end with dried berry notes, prune and rock-hard tannic bite. Give this more time if possible, but like many 2013s it might never soften and improve.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tinto Fino

"Ripe, very soft and missing out on zesty freshness, this wine is full-bodied and on the heavy side. It does have attractive strawberry fruitiness and some acidity that comes through at the end.",France-Provence:Rosé
"A very pale wine—it's just barely pink. With Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, it has a fine structured character that gives the wine weight. There are also refreshingly attractive red-berry fruits and a ripe aftertaste. Drink this complex wine from late 2017.",France-Provence:Rosé
"Here's a big, bold Zinfandel, explosive in wild forest berries, perfectly ripe and picked under the summer sun. It's softly smooth, with rich tannins and a long, sweetly spicy finish. Ed Sbragia has mastered the difficult art of elevating Dry Creek Valley. Drink now–2015.",US-California:Zinfandel

"Licorice, lemon peel, nutmeg, black cherry, requisite schist and smoke aromas set up a juicy, full-bodied, tannic palate with blackberry, mocha, cassis and mild herbal flavors.

"98-100 Barrel sample. Sumptuous, opulent, with gorgeous ripe fruit, and yet under 14 percent alcohol. The firm tannins are almost smothered by the delicious fruits. It is a great wine that expresses both the natural exuberance of Palmer and the rich fruit and balancing freshness of the vintage.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"From a cool-climate pocket within the larger Russian River Valley where even sparkling wine grapes thrive, this Pinot is muted somewhat, its flavors darker and oakier than expected, earthy yet shy in spice",US-California:Pinot Noir

This wine bursts open with vibrant tones of sweet cherry and forest berry followed by cola and a touch of fruit liqueur. The wine is easy and fresh but also shows the depth and intensity that link it to its celebrated siblings in the greater Brunello family.,Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Ripe grapy aromas are more chunky than mammoth. Saturated and muscular on the palate, this tastes of roasted salty blackberry, while the finish is full and meaty in both flavor and texture. Drink this stout full-bodied Malbec through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Tender pure peach and fine spicy notions of grapefruit zest unite to create a very inviting nose. The leafiness of fragrant citrus foliage adds extra charm. All these notions continue to play on the very zesty, thoroughly aromatic palate. Citrus flesh and peel shimmers and swirls across mind and palate, creating a dreamy, heightened cloud of fragrant freshness. The palate is just off dry and lip-smackingly bright and fresh. A triumphantly long finish adds the allure of blood orange to this seductive, aromatic wine and makes it utterly irresistible. Drink 2017–2037.",France-Alsace:Riesling
This opulent wine is full of ripe fruit and has a generous texture. Apricot and pear flavors give richness that is cut by acidity that gives the wine tremendous lift. The toast adds the lightest touch at the end. Drink from 2019.,France-Burgundy:Chardonnay

"This blend of 43% Merlot, 26% Petit Verdot, 22% Carmenère, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Syrah offers orange peel, herb, raspberry and spice aromas that don't seem entirely knit together. Dry tannins back up its blue and black fruit flavors.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Here is a big, friendly wine with plenty of sweet, spicy oak in the aromas and flavors, and an easygoing texture that's not too tannic or acidic. It shows smoky, almost sweet, toasted oak aromas and basically melts in your mouth like milk chocolate, which would make a good pairing.",US-California:Zinfandel
"The nose is still closed but already gives glimpses of citrus zestiness. The palate is a riot of both fresh and candied peel, think Seville orange, tangerine and Meyer lemon. The zesty freshness of the citrus fruit always has the upper hand on this energetic, exuberant late harvest wine and counters the residual sweetness perfectly. Killer acidity and utter concentration create a magnetic, delicious, age-worthy wine. The finish is off dry and refreshing, with a sweetish glint here and there. Drink 2017–2040 at least.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"The winery's first wine under screw cap, and only the third vintage of this variety, this has a steely nose and a thick floral layering of sweet peach and vanilla, offering a richness on the midpalate that persists through the finish.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"While slightly reserved in aroma, this serious, special-occasion wine comes on steady and strong in flavor. Blueberry and black cherry notes pick up more raspberry and red cherry with each sip. In addition to fruit complexity, it has a full body, sleek texture and lingering finish. Best now through 2020.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Bone dry and tannic, with a sour bite of acidity. It's a pretty fierce Cab, despite some decent blackberry flavors.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This discloses funk, rubber and sulfur , but otherwise is a good but chunky and beefy Garnacha. Aromas of rubber and scrambled egg veer toward boysenberry and cassis, while the palate is grabby and jammy. Flavors of baked black fruits, prune and licorice finish pasty and oaky, with a note of sweet plastic.",Spain-Northern Spain:Garnacha

"The wonderful minerality imparted by the Doctor vineyard is somehow able to keep this intensely sweet, rich wine from being heavy or cloying. Dried apricot notes mark the nose, followed by scents of mango, peach and pineapple; this wine virtually gushes with sweet tropical fruit and honey, yet maintains a wonderful sense of balance throughout.",Germany-Mosel-Saar-Ruwer:Riesling

"Layers of luscious mango, tangerine and pineapple mark this gloriously fruity, forward Riesling. It's unabashedly plump, but delicate sweetness and staccato strikes of lemon and lime lend balance. It shows remarkable elegance for something so accessible and irresistibly gulpable.",Germany-Rheinhessen:Riesling
"Ripe bramble and and berry notes are concentrated in this crisp, elegant blend of Merlot and Malbec. It's taut and tight in tannic structure still and oak tones of sweet spice, cedar and chocolate are pronounced, but everything should meld together beautifully between 2018 and 2022.",US-New York:Red Blend
"A slight, sharp wine with hints of vinegar and bramble on the nose and then skinny cherry and cranberry flavors. Too much bite and acid and not nearly enough depth, richness or fun.",Chile-Central Valley:Red Blend
"A penetrating whiff of wintergreen is the first impression of this aromatic young wine. The tightly-wound fruit brings cranberry and tart plum flavors into focus, followed by a lick of dark chocolate running through stiff tannins.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Ripe, full-bodied white Graves, its flavors coming from tropical fruit, rich and complex. Good wood underscores the yellow fruit flavors and ripeness. Ready to drink, but could also age 2–3 years.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This well-regarded vineyard shines here, ripening the grapes fully in a challenging vintage. Raspberry and cherry flavors are joined with a streak of red licorice. Among the 2013s from Purple Hands, this is likely to be the longest lived.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"A lot is going on up front; there's cassis, raisin, prune and dill aromas. Medium to full in the mouth, with lively berry, plum and spice flavors. Not too sweet and fairly long and earthy on the finish. A pure example of Rioja Reserva.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Pure notes of ripe but crisp pear on the nose turn into concentrated, herb-spiced pear and citrus notes on the palate: the ripeness of the pear vies with the zesty freshness and makes of a lively, vivid and most enjoyable and refreshing wine. This is crisp, light bodied but balanced and puts a little Austrian spring in your step.",Austria-Kremstal:Grüner Veltliner
"In this vintage, one of Sonoma's top SBs scores points in all the requisite areas. A tiny bit of talc softens the tropical fruit bouquet. More exotic fruit is on the palate, highlighted by firm edges and some citrus rind. A bit of banana sweetens the long, dry finish, leaving you with the right overall impression.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"This blends together grapes from several vineyard sites in three AVAs. It opens with a bouquet of milk chocolate and mocha, leading to a tart cranberry flavor. There's are hints of herb and bark in the finish. This is designed (successfully) as a fruit-driven, drink-now style of Oregon Pinot.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Faintly spiced, ripe apple and pear notes on the nose are mellowed by gentle, barely-there sweetness on the palate. This is rounded and pliable, but without an ounce of fat. A balanced, gently spiced wine with deep but slender richness that finishes dry.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"A blend of 80% Chardonnay and 20% Pinot Noir, this straightforward sparkler conveys aromas of red berry, mature apple and toasted nut. The palate offers cherry, strawberry and roasted almond notes alongside sharp acidity.",Italy-Italy Other:Sparkling Blend

"A butterscotch note hits the nose first, before fading to reveal scents of tea, leather and cedary spices. Medium to full-bodied, the succulent palate bears a supple core with a mineral edge.

"Dark in color and voluptuous in body and texture, this wine was aged in French oak, 35% of it new. With a sizable presence on the palate, it generously reveals brooding flavors of apple and pear.",US-California:Chardonnay
"A big, black-colored wine, impressively rich. Fermented in open stone lagars, it has an opulent ripe character, the black fruits sweet and generous. At the same time, the dense tannic structure promises good aging. Keep for 5–6 years or more.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"There's a terrific core of cherry, red currant, mineral and iodine flavor in this wine, along with an elaborate oak treatment that makes it complex and dramatic. But it's also extremely tannic, leading to the question of ageability. In all likelihood, the fruit will outlast the astringency. It should begin to come into its own after 2015, and it could continue to develop much longer.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
Opens with dark concentration and extra flesh and density in terms of texture. There's an extra padding of softness that helps buffer the vintage's high acidity and natural firmness. Not ready to drink for another 10 years at least.,Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"A compelling mix of white pepper and crushed blackberry with seams of black tar form the bouquet of this wine. They are united in a soft but still medium-weight body, with a streamlined freshness. This is as elegant, polished and well-made.",Austria-Burgenland:Austrian Red Blend

"This wine costs a lot for what it's giving. The nose starts out hard and fruitless, and while the aromas come around, the wine always holds onto its corn and haystack character. Zippy acidity gives the mouth zest, and it also livens up papaya, banana and apricot flavors. Complex and different, but does it taste good enough to justify a $78 price tag?",Spain-Catalonia:White Blend
"Firm, fruity wine, with good clean varietal flavors. Simple and ripe, with a big, tannic finish.",US-California:Zinfandel

"An aromatic wine with sharp edges, it sports bright flavors of lemon pepper, sour cherry and spicy herb. It's definitely tending toward the greener side of Syrah, but offers some interesting complexity.",US-Washington:Syrah

All in all, a fascinating wine with subtle variations on the Bordeaux theme.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This shows smooth density and bright fruit flavors of blueberry and dried raspberry, with soft hints of cinnamon and dark chocolate. The wine's fine texture and freshness make it a perfect partner to fettuccine with meat sauce and grated pecorino cheese.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"

"Crisp plum and raspberry aromas set up a snappy, tight palate with green flavors of plum, raspberry and herb. It tastes vegetal on the finish, with cutting acidity.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"A healthy wine with plenty of oak. On the nose, it's charred as well as fruity, with raspberry and plum aromas blending with vanilla. Feels tight and grippy, with dry oak, herbal flavors and fresh red berry and tomato. Finishes clean and snappy, with correct weight and length. Drink now through 2013.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend

"Light aromas of red fruit, game and vanilla are followed by quite tart puckering fruit flavors. It needs food to counteract the screaming acid.",US-Washington:Barbera
"Five grapes led by Malbec make up this full-force wine with black cherry, cough syrup, vanilla and cream on the nose. The palate is rich, creamy and heavy, with deep, saturated black fruit and chocolate flavors, while the finish is just as thick, maybe thicker. Extremely ripe and saturated, what many would call a “fruit bomb.”",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Red Blend
"Aromas of baked apple, nut oil and toast are mildly appealing, while the round, dry palate is home to flavors of melon and bitter pith. The finish of peach pit and citrus peel is par for the course, and overall it's time to get at this standard Chardonnay before it goes flaccid.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Chardonnay
"This luminous, ruby colored wine opens with a lovely bouquet of violet, rose, new leather, woodland berry and baking spice. The bright palate is loaded with finesse and smooth tannins, deliveing crushed red cherry and wild strawberry accented by clove and cinnamon.

"Buttery peach crumble and vanilla bean flavors are balanced by floral aromas and a rounded, likable character in this bold, full-bodied white.",US-California:Chardonnay

"Right away, this smells smooth and complete, with a proper mix of berry fruit, oak and earthy aromas. This is Salentein winemaker José Galante's personal wine, and it's juicy on the palate and doesn't overreach. Blackberry, boysenberry and salty, meaty notes finish with a persistent dose of salt, which should make this all the more appropriate when served with beef. Drink through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Not as rich or chewy as the Diamond Mountain Ranch bottling, Sterling's 2004 Reserve Cabernet is immediately accessible, offering aromas and flavors of cassis and dried spices and soft tannins. A good steak house red.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Pian delle Vigne's 2004 Brunello is worlds apart from the scorching hot 2003 vintage—so different, in fact, the wine seems utterly reborn. You can smell those hallmark Sangiovese aromas: cherry, blue flower and wet earth, and taste the variety's elegant acidity.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso

The elegant 12.6% alcohol makes this wine extra food friendly.",US-Virginia:Cabernet Franc
"This wine has the solid tannins the mountain is known for, and ripe flavors of blackberries, currants, cherries and chocolate, enriched with new oak. At twenty bucks, and with a low production, it's a stunning value. With real elegance and even ageworthiness, it's one of the best at its price point available now.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

The palate shows walnut oil, orange bitters, coconut, pineapple and Gala apples, proving quite ripe but balanced by ample acidity.",US-California:Chardonnay

"A thick, rich and balanced expression of great, estate-owned dirt, this wine has well-developed elements of green apple, pear and lemon, with teases of wet stone and gravelly minerality.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Strange and wayward right from the get go. The nose is herbal and foxy, and the the flavor profile is downright odd, with a dull, grapey bitterness, funk and herbal qualities. Not what we call good Carmenère.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Carmenère

"Incredibly rich and delicious aromas of vanilla, scotch, blackberry jam, strawberry preserves and cola get a dash of added intrigue from the green hint of pasilla chile. The palate shows dark chocolate and blueberry-boysenberry juice, proving very rich but not overly dense in mouthfeel.",US-California:Merlot
"So acidic, it's almost sour, and the cherry and cranberry fruit isn't rich enough to offset that tartness. As a result, it feels unbalanced and uncomfortable.",US-California:Pinot Noir

This is well supported by acids and is matched to perfectly ripe tannins.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon

With thick, furry tannins, it's a guaranteed ager, if you like your Pets old.",US-California:Petite Sirah

Coconut shavings and chocolate provide a luxurious flavor profile that meshes perfectly with the wine's lush grip of tannin and velvety mouthfeel. Dark cherry and cassis round out the flavors, accented in black pepper and clove.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This seems a bit overripe in the nose; definitely an ultraripe style, with flavors of peach, apricot and mango. Real tropical, still has decent acids, but the fruit went a bit too far, and there is a definite sweetness too, along with some breakfast toast oak.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"Made in a drier, tarter style than the winery's Russian River bottling, this Chard favors elegance over opulence. It's streamlined and crisp, with subtle notes of green apples, kumquats and honey, gently touched by smoky oak.",US-California:Chardonnay

"A touch of freshly cut apple peel is all that appears on the shy nose. The palate is more approachable and opens into beautifully aromatic notions of ripe tart apples and blossom. This has a very harmonious balance and something like tender poise. This is absolutely fresh but it comes like a caress, touching and convincing with tenderness rather than flashy force. The palate is dry, has ample and aromatic apple fruit and immense charm. This is so easy to drink right now but will certainly evolve. It finishes with a long pure echo of lemon. Drink 2017–2027.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"Marlargo appears to be a reasonably successful attempt at fashioning a pan-Australian brand, sourcing fruit from different parts of the country. This Clare Riesling starts with scents of talcum powder and lime sherbet, then follows those up with similar flavors. It's muscular and taut, even a bit austere, clocking in at only 11.4% alcohol. May develop through 2015.",Australia-South Australia:Riesling

"There is a little Cabernet Sauvignon (15%) and Syrah (4%) in the blend also. This is a silky, yet muscular— let's say it, masculine—style of Merlot. Meaning that the fruit is concentrated with deep blue and black berry and cassis flavors, augmented with lead pencil. Beautiful polish and concentration characterize this wine, yet it's quite approachable.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Billy Wathen and Dick Dore pick this cofermented blend of 85% Syrah and 15% Viognier together on the same day. The result is very savory, with resinous herbs and root beer on the nose. Once sipped, a rainbow of dark flavors emerges: chopped Italian herbs, creosote, black olive, fennel, soy and orange pith, reminiscent of a North African tagine.",US-California:Syrah

"This immense Cabernet contains 3% Malbec, and it's about as ripe and raisiny as a wine can get while still holding onto a semblance of balance. Aromas of raisin and baked blackberry blend with rooty cola and vanilla notes. This feels heavy to the point of syrupy, while flavors of prune, mocha and blueberry finish chunky, with low acidity. Drink through 2019.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Modest apple and citrus aromas are clean and pleasant, and the same can be said of the flavors, which add hints of melon to the mix. The wine is plump and round in the mouth, but finishes long and crisp. This is a solid effort from this négociant house, which has never been a favorite here. Let's hope it's a positive indicator for the future.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style White Blend
"Yellow plum, sweet apple and juicy pear form an appetizing, aromatic trinity. Those apple flavors, some of them fresh, some bruised, some baked, become the central theme of the lemon-focused palate. With some time, honeyed notes come to the fore and suggest that many things still lie hidden in this fruit-laden Riesling. The finish is dry, the entire wine is focused and still taut. It's delicious now but will reward cellaring.Drink 2015–2025.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"A blend of Riesling and Muscat with a pinch of Gewürztraminer, this wine offers vibrant aromas of orange peel, fresh flowers, spice and jasmine that don't entirely meld. It drinks dry with light concentration and a slightly bitter finish.",US-Washington:White Blend

"While 2011 has been widely seen as one of the great Port vintages for long-term aging, there are also wines, like this, that are so attractive they can be drunk early.

"Cherry, leather, tobacco, licorice and chocolate-dipped strawberries combine into a heady nose on this single-vineyard bottling from the Grenache-focused winery. Tongue-tingling acidity runs through flavors of balsamic vinegar and strawberry extract, all held together by steady tannins. It's quite a full presentation of the grape.",US-California:Grenache

"Aromas of herb, grass, pear and citrus lead to sleek fruit flavors. It shows a lot of elegance but lacks concentration.",US-Washington:Sauvignon Blanc
"Much improved from past efforts, this firm and fruity Tempranillo has a lush core of boysenberry and black cherry fruit.

"Fruit from this 12-acre site has a well-rounded aspect, with nuanced flavors of pomegranate, marionberry, black cherry and cola.

It offers exceptional value for the price.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Another in the new N&N; line, the Sullenger features red and black fruit, herbs, some earth, and an appealing whiff of sautéed pancetta or bacon. Commendable richness in support of black-plum flavor and coffee notes. Its poundcake-like density urges cellaring.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This boutique estate was founded in 1926 by Alessio Grasso and is now run by his grandson Giuseppe.

"Impressive dark purple in color, this powerful vin carries lots of toasted-oak aromas: menthol and cedar in particular. There's some promising dark fruit underneath it all that should emerge in a couple years' time. Less exciting than this winery's 1996, which leads to the question: could the creation of a luxury cuvée have had an effect on the quality of this wine?",France-Southwest France:Red Blend

"A strong, bold young wine, with good varietal flavors of blackberries and black currants.

"In addition to the fig and yellow apple aromas, there's noticeable tropicality on the nose of this wine, but it tightens around tart Meyer lemon pith and crushed ants. Ripe lemons also power the sharp and pithy palate, which offers a shred of roasted almonds and marzipan.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This low-production Zin gets extra credit for sheer power. It's explosive, with briary, brambly flavors of wild raspberry, cherry and blackberry, complete with spice notes of anise, cinnamon and pepper, all wrapped in soft tannins. This would be great now with spicy beef and poultry dishes or pizza.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Herbal and somewhat harsh in tannin, this wine is plummy and forceful, blended with smaller amounts of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. It has a bitterness to the finish that's a mix of cedar, currant and leather.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Bright, ripe red plums predominate in this wine that tastes very young, intensely fruity and veering towards dryness. Rich and juicy, it is still developing its mature velvet character. It should lose some its primary fruits and become more balanced, so wait until 2016.",Portugal-Port:Port
"This red combines Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon to create black currant and Mediterranean herb aromas. The easygoing, approachable palate shows black cherry and dark spice flavors, framed by polished tannins. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend

"Blueberries and blackberries are the dominant themes here, with some smoky notes playing a supporting role. Bright, tart and fruity, this doesn’t appear to have the depth for aging.

"Ripe stone fruit notes, especially aromatic Mirabelle plum, rise from the glass, alongside more evolved chamomile tisane scents.

"This wine is a blend of Riesling (70%) and Gewürztraminer. It brings aromas of pear, lychee and white flowers that are followed by an off-dry palate. It needs some more acidity to pull it all together.",US-Washington:White Blend
"There's an unparalleled woody intensity on the nose of this offering, with cigar box, myrrh, incense and bay leaf decorating the black peppercorn, herb-laced salt, dark chocolate and black plum aromas.

"This white is barrel fermented and then aged further sur lie in a mix of French oak, stainless steel and concrete egg, with the goal of additional texture and complexity coming into play.

Lime juice, wet cement and apple peels combine for a standard and straightforward flavor profile, which is clean, tight and packs a good acidic sizzle.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"The complex nose boasts hints of spring flowers, tobacco, maple syrup and cedar. Now into its second decade, this wine is fully mature, with flavors of molasses and mushrooms that have replaced some of the cherry notes of its youth. The mouthfeel is silky and elegant; the finish chocolaty and smooth. Drink up.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a really fantastic wine and one of the best expression of Falanghina available today. (Perhaps the best.) What sets it apart is the purity of its fruit aromas.

"Slightly lighter than other takes on the grape, this wine shows hibiscus, black plum, grape soda and gravel on the nose. It's soft on the palate with red cherry, cranberry and dried strawberry fruit, balanced by dill and black pepper on the edges. Some sales proceeds go to a medical relief organization.",US-California:Mourvèdre
"This shows the combo of a cool vintage and deft winemaking. It's impressively deep in citrus, fig and pepper flavors, with just a touch of oak that adds a nice, smoky edge. With high acidity, it really gets those tastebuds whistling. Best of all, the wine achieves the Holy Grail: low alcohol, only 13%, and bone dryness.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"A very fruity, floral wine, it's lightly spicy while showing white fruits and citrus right up front. It is dry but the fruitiness gives the wine a lively feel and a soft aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Alsace:Pinot Blanc

Herb and barrel spice aromas lead to plump cherry and cranberry flavors. The tannins bring some grip.,US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Concentrated black cherry notes on the nose and palate are accented by dark, mossy, bramble notes and hints of green and menthol.

"Alberto Longo is a rising star in the Puglia region and this fragrant Falanghina is a good example of his talent - especially considering that Puglia is primarily known for its reds.

"Rough, earthy and tannic, with simple, high-toned, black cherry fruit, and substantial tannins that seem to have been somehow smoothed over, leaving the wine a bit dull.",US-Oregon:Cabernet Sauvignon

"A promising mix of 43% Touriga Nacional and 57% Tempranillo, this bottling shows tar, dark blueberry, black cherry, crushed graphite and slate and oregano on the earthy nose. The palate meshes dark fruit with lighter herbs, proving surprisingly underweight in mouthfeel yet offering a leather and dust character.",US-California:Red Blend
"Elegant and complex, this gorgeous wine is all about finesse, offering enticing aromas of rose petal, iris, perfumed berry, baking spices, anise and chopped aromatic herbs. The structured but silky palate seamlessly melds together juicy Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, clove, licorice and tobacco while bright acidity and ultrafine tannins provide the framework.

Under all that, loads of ripe raspberries and cherries. Shows the excellent hallmarks of a fine Santa Rita Pinot Noir, but certainly is one of the oakier versions.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A fresh, off-dry wine with a year's aging is unusual for a Vinho Verde in this style. The result is that although the wine has lost some of its startling fruit and acidity, it has smoothed out, giving more room for the apple flavors. Drink now.",Portugal-Vinho Verde:Portuguese White
"This certified organic and biodynamic wine has no sulfites added. It offers deep color plus bold black cherry and smoke aromas.

"Still tight, and expertly crafted and structured, this single-vineyard estate wine is meticulous in velvety, plush texture, completely seductive at every angle.

This wine is still quite wound up, but that acidity will prove mouthwatering for years to come.",US-California:Grenache
"The powerful flavors of this Syrah are both its strength and weakness. No question it's a delicious wine, upfront in blackberry pie filling, currant, licorice, dark chocolate and peppery spices. However the very power of flavor makes it hard to pair with subtle food. Best with strong plates, like short ribs or beef tamales.",US-California:Syrah

"Since we last reviewed a vintage of Romaneira, with the 2005 wine, the estate has moved closer to realizing its potential. This is an impressive, powerful yet elegant wine. Its dark fruits are sustained by wood and leavened by acidity. It has a great sense of style and considerable aging potential.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red

"This wine epitomizes the lush ripeness of the 2009 vintage, yet does so without going over the top into dried fruit.

Drink now–2020.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend

"Aromas of wood spice, tar, green herbs and black cherry lead to plump fruit flavors. Grainy dry tannins provide support.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is done in a wide-open, instantly drinkable style that makes it an excellent, everyday quaffer. Young Oregon Pinots often need more time, but not this one. Strawberry, coffee and cola flavors combine into a broad and flavorful midpalate, fresh and inviting.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Smooth and soft, this is a restrained Grenache intense in cranberry and Rainier cherry, easy to drink and love. Made in small quantities from a Lodi producer known for its Zinfandels, it demonstrates the potential of Grenache from the right place in the right hands.",US-California:Grenache
"Few wineries in Argentina make more individual wines than Achaval-Ferrer. And while some are great, others leave you scratching your head or wanting something different. This one has a deep hue but a strange mix of herbal, floral aromas that hint at air freshener. The palate is quite acid-driven and downright sharp, with pounding blueberry and kirsch flavors. More austere and tangy than we prefer.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"The barn door is open and the horses have left. This is close to DOA, with mushy, weak aromas and flavors, and almost no distinct fruit at any point.",Argentina-Other:Torrontés
"This opens with aromas of underbrush, tilled soil and ripe, black plum. On the palate, notes of ground pepper and baking spice accent the black cherry core. Firm, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2018.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"A blend of 70% Pinot Nero and 30% Chardonnay, this has aromas of ripe orchard fruit, citrus and a whiff of pastry dough. The bright palate delivers golden apple and toasted almond alongside small persistent bubbles and fresh acidity.",Italy-Piedmont:Sparkling Blend
"Oak, sawdust, espresso, chocolate and plum lead the nose on this somewhat nondescript wine. The palate offers oak, toast and black berries alongside green tannins and nervous acidity. It lacks complexity as well as fruit richness.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"From one of the most familiar brands of Franciacorta, this opens with aromas of red apple skin, lemon zest and candied nectarine slices. The palate offers Golden Delicious apple and hints of liqueur alongside zesty acidity and tight, persistent bubbles that leave a crisp finish.",Italy-Lombardy:Sparkling Blend
"Oaky toast, cedar and hint of meat add complexity and flavor to this light-bodied, mellowed wine, highlighted by soft, firm tannin and brooding blackberry.",US-California:Merlot
"This is a rich, succulent wine, more akin to an auslese than a true spätlese. Dried apricot and orange marmalade aromas and flavors surround a core of dried spices and crushed stone, finishing on a spicy, mineral note. Drink now–2025.",Germany-Rheingau:Riesling
"Underbrush, intense rose petal, rosemary, grilled herbs and red berry scents leap from the glass. Polished and almost pulsating with energy, the palate displays succulent red cherry, sage, leather, cinnamon and white pepper alongside supple tannins and vibrant acidity. Drink after 2020 for more complexity.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Dense tannins dominate this firm and structured wine. Behind the dry surface lies fruitiness, bringing out red currant and berry flavors along  with acidity. The wine is potentially rich and deliciously perfumed. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"A consummate Russian River Pinot Noir in an accessible style. This is simply enchanting, like raspberry-infused silk dusted with brown butter, cinnamon and vanilla. Showing just beautifully now, this is soft and gentle, and it should glide through the next six years.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This wine is all herbal fruits, with spice from the wood-aging and lively acidity. It has considerable potential, full of its nervy texture, minerality and tight acidity. Wait at least into 2020. Tristan and Loïc Kressmann now run the family estate.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This is a soft wine with a great depth of red fruits and fresh acidity. The tannins are light, just a hint of dry behind the fragrant, bright fruitiness. The wine, made from old vines, is ready to drink.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"The wine is round and full in the mouth. The acidity gives a fresh character to the ripe caramel flavors that shine through the light texture. It is a wine that needs food, with its lively acidity giving a dry, mineral aftertaste.",France-France Other:Rosé
"Stiff at first, the Stoller puts on more interesting layers after an hour or two of breathing time. Pomegranate, peach skin, mineral and smoke components weave together, with slightly bitter phenolics wrapping up the finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This lush wine, green/gold in hue, offers mouth-coating flavors with richness and style. Apple, pear and papaya fruit holds down the center, with elements of toasted hazelnuts and butter pecan from aging in 20% new French oak. The creamy, smooth finish is delightful.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"This soft, although food friendly wine has a creamy character and touch of vanilla. The ripe melon and apricot fruit are balanced with the acidity and the warm texture. This is an enticing ripe wine that is ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"This beautifully perfumed wine has all the tannins that will allow it to age over many decades. It also offers the rich blackberry, dark plum and great structure that will support that aging. As so often, Noval has released a vintage when other major producers have held back. But this powerful wine fully justifies the decision. Drink from 2025 for the fruit, 2030 for the complexity.",Portugal-Port:Port
"A reductive, bitter rubber component stubbornly dominates this wine. There's cranberry and rhubarb fruit, ample acids, and otherwise all is in balance. But that burnt rubber note carries right through the finish. Two bottles were tasted with similar results.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Stainless fermented and aged, this tart, apple-flavored Pinot Gris is close to fresh cider in flavor. The alcohol is low enough that it is almost invisible. Just pure, juicy, clean fruit comes through.",US-Oregon:Pinot Gris
"Oily, gritty stone-fruit aromas announce a plump, soft palate with papaya and banana flavors. A mealy quality and bitterness rise up on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Chardonnay
"Alluring scents of perfumed berry, underbrush, pipe tobacco and leather come together on this firmly structured wine. The palate delivers mature black cherry, crushed raspberry, sage, rosemary, clove and a hint of cured meat. It's extremely well balanced thanks to assertive, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Smooth, creamy aromas are followed by a rich, concentrated mouthful, with spice showing through the green berry fruits, apples and cream flavors. This tastes warm, inviting, with yellow fruits adding an exotic element in the aftertaste.",Austria-Kamptal:Grüner Veltliner
"This is a nice Chardonnay to drink with shellfish, particularly grilled shrimp. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with rich pineapple, green apple and pear flavors, accented with sweet, toasty oak.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Crushed violet, red berry, mint and menthol aromas lead the nose. The firm palate offers dried red cherry, raw strawberry, licorice, white pepper and sage alongside grippy tannins that leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unclench then enjoy before the remaining fruit fades.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Sexy aromas of expensive perfume, exotic spices and honey give way to a strikingly intense palate accented by caramelized apple notes. Finish is long and a bit sweet. Serve this luxurious wine with lobster in a fruit preparation.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"This pale salmon-pink bubbly opens with frothy bubbles and an inviting note of hard candy. A rounded strawberry flavor unfolds on the palate and finishes dry, making this a lively, ideal party wine that will please many.",Austria-Österreichischer Sekt:Sparkling Blend
"Shows the herbal, sweet green pea quality that often marks Chards from the central Napa Valley, but that gives it an interesting twist. Otherwise, you'll find tropical fruits, cream, buttered popcorn and zesty acidity.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Crisp stony lightly herbal plum aromas are moderately smoky. This feels flush and pleasant, with a full body and flavors of plum, cassis and tomato sauce. A controlled composed finish benefits from lasting acidity.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Only 6,000 bottles and 300 magnums have been made of this wine, from a parcel in the famed La Landonne vineyard. This is a beautifully crafted wine, with vanilla and polished violet perfumes. To taste, the ripeness of the tannins and the richness of the fruit give both complexity and elegance. It should age for at least 15 years.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Nutty aromas are rich and oily in this semisweet amontillado. It is round and chewy on the palate, with a layering of creamy, nutty flavors: Toffee, chocolate and caramel. These notes linger on the unwavering finish.",Spain-Andalucia:Sherry
"Savory aromas and flavors combine with a soft texture in this full-bodied wine. It smells smoky and roasted, tastes like pomegranate and cherry juice and has a streak of acidity but not much tannin.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is almost pure Cab, with the addition of just 2% Malbec. Solidly in the firm, muscular, polished style of winemaker Holly Turner, this is a substantial effort that will need to be decanted if you are going to drink it any time soon. Black cherry, cassis and blue plum are swathed in milk chocolate, but this is Cabernet with its sinews intact, showing streaks of herb, smoke and light pepper. I can't imagine a better companion to it than a good, rare steak.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Green and yellow pear are subsumed into a savory whole composed of yeast and crushed kitchen herbs. There are highlights of Granny Smith apple and lemon rind, of lovage and white pepper, and all of these flavors are put into tight, peppery focus on the slender but concentrated palate. This fizzes with peppery spice and zest.",Austria-Kamptal:Grüner Veltliner
"Lots of new oak on this young Merlot, and the wood dominates, sending out waves of toast, clove and vanilla-buttered toast aromas. Oak tannins join the grapeskin tannins in making the mouthfeel hard and astringent. The underlying flavors are of blackberries, black cherries, red licorice and unsweetened baker's chocolate. It's a good wine that should develop bottle complexity through 2012.",US-California:Merlot
"A broad wine, its ripe flavors fashioned with yellow fruits, toast, vanilla and an opulent texture. This is rich, open and packed with full-in-the-mouth flavors. Ready to drink.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Dusty and dry on the nose, with raspberry and peppery spice notes that are true to the variety. Relatively solid in the mouth, with peppy red fruit flavors, tea and a tartness suggesting citrus or apple skins. Snappy juice that makes the grade.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Pinot Noir
"A Syrah for all the California Zin lovers out there, this is heavy and brimming with dark cherry flavor amid a wall of tannins, leather and earth.",US-California:Syrah
"Scratchy cherry and berry aromas feature a note of warm earth. This blend of 45% each of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot along with 10% Malbec feels tight, choppy and tartaric. Flavors of wild berry, cherry and cassis end long due to forceful acidity.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Red Blend
"An absolutely first-rate Pinot Noir that's perfect for drinking now and over the next year or so. The texture is light and elegant, almost weightless, yet the raspberry, cherry, red licorice, cola and spice flavors pack a whallop.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Slightly floral notes combine the creaminess of jasmine with the fresh scent of mandarin peel. Despite the typical varietal broadness of Pinot Gris, this wine offers an appealing slenderness and a tender balance. Subtle and almost delicate, it conveys a touching edge of florality and lovely seam of acidity.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"This winery's name is a nod to the adjacent Pleasant Valley Cemetery in San Miguel, where the warm climate suits Zinfandel well. Plump and bursting boysenberry and lingonberry aromas are dusted with vanilla and marjoram on the nose. The palate's flavors range from ripe red fruit to clove-driven spice and herbal touches, with pepper-laced acidity.",US-California:Zinfandel
"As rich as this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is, and it is extraordinarily rich, there's something standard about it. It's as though the ripeness of the fruit has obliterated any trace of terroir. Offers a fantastically sweet explosion of blackberries, cherries, plums and chocolate, alongside caramelized, butterscotchy oak, but beyond the sheer power, the wine isn't displaying much subtlety. Hard to tell where it's going, if anywhere.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine by Gypsy Canyon's Deborah Hall raises money for dogs in Thailand, but it's certainly no gimmick. Deep aromas of black raspberry, cherry chiffon and dried violets mix with chipped slate, charred pine, morel mushrooms and turned loam. The palate shows sharp cranberry followed by graphite and herbal saps, with noticeable grip.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This cool-climate expression shows exceptionally-beautiful tones of peach, melon and pear. A tiny percentage of the wine is aged in French barrel. This is a fantastic white wine to pair with fish, white meat or vegetables..",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Bianco
"Saucy scents accent core cherry aromas, along with sandalwood and herbal notes. This wine has a lively, pinching palate that is high in acidity. Herbal flavors of tomato sauce and red plum finish long due to racy, raw acidity.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Franc
"Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah make up the majority of this blend. Aromas of dark plum, dried herb, black fruit and bittersweet chocolate are followed by full-bodied black-fruit flavors. It delivers a lot of enjoyment.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"A bit jammy and simple, with fresh, primary flavors of blackberries and cherries that are almost sweet. Oak adds creamy, smoky notes. Drink now.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Whispers of smoke and crushed stone add an interesting element to the fleshy, ripe peach and lychee flavors. A tad sugary on attack, but it finishes dry, with a hint of bitter tea-leaf notes.",US-New York:Gewürztraminer
This is a textured wine from a six-acre vineyard. It has fine tannins as well as red-plum skin and red-berry fruits. It is balanced and fruity although the texture does give it a tangy edge that should soften out from 2017.,France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Chocolate mocha and black fruit define this full-bodied, robustly made and oaked wine from a mountain appellation. Moderate acidity helps cut through the generous tannin and rich ripeness, finding a brushy dried sage note along the way.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Crisp in a very good way, this wine has lively lemon and green-apple aromas, flavors that are a bit riper than that and a texture that's smooth without giving up a little nip of acidity. The wine has great balance, light body and a high refreshment quotient.",US-California:Pinot Grigio
"Mild and powdery smelling, with inviting tropical undertones. The palate mixes flesh with freshness, and the flavors of lychee, green melon and white pepper are straight from the textbook. Finishes mildly bitter, which is natural for Mendoza Torrontés.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Torrontés
"The vineyard is relatively new, and the block from which this wine was made is entirely Dijon clone 777. It's a rich, fruit-forward wine, brimming with crushed cherry pulp and black raspberries, to which charred oak barrels have lent richer notes of mocha. The wine also is quite dry and acidic and even tannic, in Farrell's usual style. That should lend it ageworthiness.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"The 2010 vintage of Te Kahu is 80% Merlot, with only single-digit percentages of the other varieties. It's a darkly fruited wine, with notes of black cherry and blackberry that are impeccably clean and precise. Drink this silky-textured, medium-bodied wine over the next five years.",New Zealand-Hawke's Bay:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Lots of juicy flavor in this dry, jammy wine. It's strong in raspberries, cherries and sweet, smoky sandalwood, with lovely Carneros acidity. Best now and for a few years for freshness and vivacity.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Minerally citrus aromas are the greeting on this high-end, pure SB. Stony minerality and citric acidity make for a fresh, polished mouthfeel, while flavors of lime, passion fruit and grapefruit are focused and smooth, and not at all soft. When people talk about fine cool-climate Chilean SB, this is what they should be referencing.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Deep gold, fully ripened and rich with tropical fruits, melon and peach, this is a wine for hedonistic palates and near-term consumption. The moderate acids and slightly elevated alcohol suggest that drinking it over the next couple of years will bring maximum enjoyment.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"Pretty straightforward Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, but done well, featuring passion fruit, pink grapefruit and melon aromas and flavors that end on a gently herbal note.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"Earthy and a touch gritty smelling on first take, this gets riper, cleaner and better the longer it catches air. A full slightly tannic palate is mildly abrasive, while tea, herbal berry and chocolaty oak flavors are appealing. A spicy peppery chocolaty finish is not shedding its drying tannins. Drink through 2022.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"David Sterza makes one of the best Ripassos ever and the low price of this delicious wine makes it all the more irresistible. Huge concentration and inky richness is offset by sweet cherry, black licorice, cola and dried flowers. The wine is long, smooth and firmly structured.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"The oldest Chardonnay vines in the Willamette Valley, planted in 1965, create a spicy, textural, refined wine with tremendous length and detail. All the wine was aged in neutral wood, which shines a light on the beautiful fruit, with green apple, almonds, and hints of butter and vanilla.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"Lemony and light on the bouquet. The palate is aggressive, almondy tasting and tight, with lemony lead flavors, peach notes and a lasting but not unpleasant bitterness. Nicely balanced, with good mouthfeel. A very nice wine and a different breed within the wide world of Spanish white wines.",Spain-Catalonia:Garnacha Blanca
"Herb, dried leaf, green pepper, tobacco and spice aromas are followed by plump yet elegant cherry and tobacco flavors. Smoke and savory notes linger on the finish.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Jammy in raspberries and cherries, with a mouthwatering burst of acidity. But fundamentally this is a simple wine, and it also has some overripe raisin flavors.",US-California:Merlot
"Ferguson is L'Ecole's newest estate vineyard, and this Bordeaux-style blend marks its single-vineyard debut. It's 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot and 11% Cabernet Franc, grown at 1,500 feet in almost pure basalt. The minerality is a signature trait, along with raspberry, cassis and wild cherry fruit flavors. This seems sure to improve by 2020–2022.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is crisp, with citrus and red apple fruits that are heightened by the taut structure. Nervy acidity adds to the tense feel while judicious layers of wood warm the finish. For long-term aging.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay

"Flint, ripe peaches and golden apricots with the merest hint of vanilla suggest the finest Viennese pastries. This well-judged and super-mellow wine is just rich enough, also giving hints of almond paste and lime peel. There is no heaviness, just velvety mouthfeel and sumptuous length.",Austria-Wagram-Donauland:Grüner Veltliner
"The trick to a successful Zinfandel is to capture the grape's briary, brambly rusticity and lend it elegance and balance. This wine succeeds at that task. It's kind of a field blend with 25% of the wine made from what the winemaker calls “mixed blacks.” Whatever the varieties are, the wine is smooth, rich and delicious, showing complex wild berry, mocha, licorice, baking spice and sandalwood flavors. Should easily hold its own over the next 10 years.",US-California:Zinfandel
"The winery calls this their “Bunny Cuvée” due to the rabbit on the label. It's well made, of fair value, with sharp details. Cranberry and raspberry fruit flavors punch through with a gentle streak of cola. The finish comes with a hint of composted earth.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"On the light-bodied side of the Pinot Noir spectrum, with modest red-fruit aromas and flavors accented by some funky, oaky notes of tree bark and charred nuts.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Pinot Noir

It shows a dark garnet color in the glass and has flavors of toasted espresso bean, tobacco, leather and spice with aromatic vanilla endnotes.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Spiced plum, crushed blue flower, black currant and a whiff of warms spice waft out of the glass. The high-toned palate delivers ripe blackberry, date and dried cherry accented with notes of nutmeg, licorice and black pepper. Velvety tannins provide structure.",Italy-Veneto:Red Blend
"A rainy cement minerality on the nose of this sweet wine manages to cut through the sugared oranges, honeysuckle and ripe, tropical white fleshed fruit, from peach to cherimoya. The palate is full of honeyed apples, white peach and pineapple, but the decent acidity and chalky element stops it short of treacly.",US-California:Gewürztraminer
"The wine opens with a dark, impenetrable color and a thick, somewhat murky appearance. The nose is thick and syrupy with muddled tones of mature fruit and blueberry, while the mouthfeel is chunky and very sticky.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Made from 70% Sangiovese and other red grapes, including Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a little rustic and wild. The palate is rich, full and offers plenty to chew on. Bold plum and black cherry flavors dominate. A nice woody accent graces the finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Aromas of Christmas spice, pepper and dried fruit fall more into the traditional category than modern, while the palate is snappy, a little lean and delivers strawberry and raspberry fruit with a light buttery oak note. Tight and dry on the finish, but lean. Ready to drink.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"Wonderful rose-petal aromas and Anjou-pear flavors give this dry wine lots of personality, while the mouthfeel is smooth and luxurious. It also has an underlying crispness for good balance and a lingering finish.",US-California:Gewürztraminer
"A gentle wine, soft and with attractive green fruits. It is light and tangy although the flavors are muted at the moment. Give it a few months for an easy apéritif style.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend

"This is a perfect example of why Moscato is so popular. What's not to like, with the crisp, clean mouthfeel and seemingly sweet flavors of honey, orange and vanilla? So zesty, it's impossible not to drink a few glasses, and the alcohol is refreshingly low.",US-California:Moscato

"Dark and fruity, this juicy wine is packed with black cherry and highlighted with tobacco and coffee. The tannins are substantial, and hint at clean earth. It's big and full through the middle, but tails off a bit in the finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Not bad on the nose, where you get some tropicality, buttercup and flower blossom. But once you get onto the palate things go south. The acidity is high, creating tangy, lemony flavors, and all totaled there's not much here besides generic citrus and water.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Sauvignon Blanc
"Attractive and fruity, this wine is full of fresh red fruits as well as balanced wood flavors. The tannins are soft, already integrated, and have a warm feel to them. The wine will age, intensifying in fruitiness over the next two years.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Seemingly one dimensional, this wine is tight and packed with acidity. It has a fine texture marked with lemon-and-lime zestiness, but misses the mark in terms of depth and complexity. Drink now.",France-France Other:Chardonnay
"Ruddy, ripe plum and cherry tones penetrate deeply through the core of this bold, voluptuous Pinot Noir. The palate balances opulent fruit with subtle tones of bramble and savory herb, as well as a piercing line of acidity. Fine grained but grippy tannins mark a puckery finish.",US-New York:Pinot Noir
"This Zin is a little on the soft side, but it's very good, even charming in the way it flatters the palate with richness. Offers a burst of ripe blackberries, currants and pepper, wrapped into perfectly ripe Napa tannins. Drink now through 2010.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Aromas of toasted oak, mint, vanilla and dried berry lead the nose and continue to the palate along with coffee and anise notes. It's rather austere and lacks fruit richness.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Red Blend

"Aromas of mature berry, espresso, exotic spice and a whiff of menthol emerge on this full-bodied red.

Some smoky notes frame black cherry and black olive fruit, while the texture is creamy on the midpalate, fading a bit on the finish.",Australia-South Australia:Red Blend
"Terre di Giumara is a line of value wines. This Nero d'Avola offers bright aromas of berry, cassis, fennel, moist earth and almond that recall the natural fragrances of Sicily. The wine is simple, fresh and clean on the close.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nero d'Avola
"This wine smacks you in the face first thing, demanding attention, before settling into mouthwateringly succulent layers of Asian pear, graham cracker and Nilla wafer. An underbelly of oak supports the fruit, remaining subtle and providing structure. The acidity shines most on the finish, inviting further exploration.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This is one of the most forward and accessible of Calera's new releases. It's superrich now in black cherry liqueur, mocha, licorice, bacon and spice flavors, a seductively silky wine that's a total hedonistic pleasure. If you can keep from drinking it now, it should develop well over the next 6–8 years.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is consistently one of Zaca Mesa's best Syrahs of several bottlings they produce every vintage. The mildly cool year was kind to the fruit, giving controlled blackberry and black currant flavors that are wrapped in refined tannins. The wine finishes with a swirl of smoke and peppery spice, plus a touch of warmth from the alcohol. Drink now–2015.",US-California:Syrah
"Fruit for this Bordeaux blend (it's only 80% Cab) is grown organically in Maipo Valley's San Bernardo Vineyard.  Though the nose is a bit closed, black pepper, dried herb and toast aromas still peek through. A long, tannin-and-char finish punctuates the blackberry, cream and oak palate flavors. It's a little tight now, and will be better in a year or two.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"There is a good balance of tropical and citrus flavors on this warm, ripe wine. The fruit easily covers the more mineral core that gives structure. Rich and full-bodied, it can age through 2015.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc

"Plum and cherry fruit show on the nose of this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot, 10% Malbec, 10% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot, but an iodine character adds a counterpoint to the fruit.

"Woody, heady black-fruit aromas are charred and minty. The palate is dense and tannic, while charred, earthy black-fruit flavors show herbal after tones prior to a dry and woody finish. A bit of time in the cellar should help this integrate and fully come together; drink after 2018 and through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Aromas of creamy vanilla and mixed berry fruits are a bit jumbled. This has a full, grabby, chunky palate, with spicy plum and peppery flavors that don't show a lot of variation or complexity. On the finish, there's heat and oak to cut through.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Thanks to long maceration and fermentation on the skins, this has heady aromas of Spanish broom, acacia, yellow stone fruit, grilled herb and a whiff of baked bread. Round, savory and fresh, the intriguing palate has an impressive depth of flavors including ripe yellow peach, mature yellow apple, lemon drop, toasted almond, flinty mineral and an earthy note of tilled soil. Tangy acidity brightens the finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Vernaccia
"Dark and rich in color, this dense, gamy and smoky wine offers licorice and leather in equal proportions. It's still young and grippy on the palate, but time should soften its layers, which do mellow on the finish. Cellar through 2017,",US-California:Syrah

"Ripe and plump blackberries shine through in a showcase of fruit purity, lifted by dried fennel, hot black gravel, peppercorns, toasted sesame and soy. There is tremendous structure and acidity on the sip, with black pepper and black-sesame nuance plus juicy boysenberry character to the midpalate.",US-California:Syrah

"This small, family-owned, biodynamically farmed vineyard and winery is quickly becoming a southern Oregon cult producer. Certainly one of the finest Viogniers produced anywhere in the Northwest, this extraordinarily aromatic wine showers the palate with luscious and tangy lemon, pineapple, Satsuma orange and pear fruit flavors. Then the spices pile on, lending an exotic twist to a lengthy midpalate, and leading into a lightly toasty finish.",US-Oregon:Viognier

"This brawny wine opens with subdued aromas that recall leafy underbrush, roasted coffee bean and a whiff of stewed plum. The warm, monolithic palate offers prune steeped in spirits, toasted nut, dark spice and a green note of powdered sage alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish. The heat of evident alcohol on the close throws it further off-balance.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Toasty, warm, charred aromas accent earthy, enticing plum and prune scents. This ripe, round, well-structured Rioja is moderately deep on the palate but also bouncy and elegant.

Although only 12.5% abv, the wine is richly textured on the palate, then turning crisp and refreshing on the finish.",Germany-Pfalz:Riesling

Drink through 2023.",Italy-Southern Italy:Greco
"A nicely drinkable Chardonnay marked by vigorous acidity and creamy-smooth flavors of pineapple tart, Key lime pie and lemongrass. Good as an inexpensive alternative to coastal bottlings that cost far more.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Cola, coconut and ripe blackberry aromas are draped all over the wine's bouquet. On the palate, it's a bit choppy and acidic, with pounding flavors of black cherry, blackberry and leather.

"On the first pass the wine smells rubbery and minty, with a note of green herbs poking through.

Finishes sweet, muscular and sticky.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Winemakers Anthony Riboli and Arnaud Debons crafted this blend of 36% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Malbec, 21% Petit Verdot, 11% Petite Sirah and 4% Syrah to celebrate the winery's 100th year, with big and tasty results.

The package is rich and powerful, yet spicy and structured.",US-California:Red Blend
"Stalky aromas suggest corn, while overall this smells flat and sulfuric. Acidity is keeping it going, while flavors of mixed citrus are undefined. On the finish, this is showing signs of fading.",Chile-Central Valley:Sauvignon Blanc

"A zippy Sierra Foothills SB with pleasing grapefruit and a coating of minerals, this wine has length and lift.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Angular and piquant on the nose, with tight aromas of red zinger tea, fresh herbs and raspberry. This is a Pinot made in a light, coastal style; it offers red cherry, cough drop and tea-like flavors in front of a lasting, unforced but mild finish. A year in French oak has added a buttery element, and overall the wine rings true but distant.",Chile-Leyda Valley:Pinot Noir
"Dry and spare, this offers stem and herb flavors ahead of a tight core of raspberry fruit. A Pommard and Dijon 114 clone mix, it spent 19 months in 27% new French oak. It seems to need another year or two of bottle age to come together.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This wine is made from grapes grown on the producer's RockRise Mountain vineyard, 1,100-feet up. Graham cracker provides a decadent introduction to the nose and palate, as extracted, extended red fruit plays along.

The brooding notes of bittersweet chocolate, medicine cabinet, and cherry cola are concentrated however with structured, slightly dry tannins in a wine that calls out for steak if ever there were one.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"In its silver-coated bottle with the “Ace of Spades” logo, this is a crisp, mineral-driven wine, full of acidity and with a bright character on the dry side of brut. Young with layers of apple fruits, it will age. Drink now for the fruit or keep for maturity from 2018. This is one of five Champagnes by entrepreneur and rapper Jay Z under the Armand de Brignac Empire brand that is produced by the Cattier family, in Champagne since 1763.",France-Champagne:Chardonnay

"From the new Happy Canyon appellation, this wine is so close to being so good. It's dry and rich in acidity, and complex in blackberry, cherry and currant flavors that finish long and sweet. This new 7200 line from Foxen is worth watching over future vintages.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"It's unclear why this wine's bottle has to be so heavy. After all, the wine inside is ripe, fruity and very ready to drink, certainly not for aging. Black fruits have matured into a leather texture and smoky flavors. The wine is ripe and full in the mouth with just a touch of pepper at the end from alcohol. Drink now.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"Powerful scents of toast and buttered popcorn dominate the nose, but once in the mouth the wine shows some grip and depth. For those who love the buttery style of Chardonnay, this will be hard to beat at this price. Traces of apple and pear fruit show in the midpalate, and the wine lingers gracefully into a full-bodied finish.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"This is a well-balanced wine with honeyed ripeness contrasted with attractive, crisp acidity. Pineapple and baked-apple flavors are given a texture by the zing of the honey. It is ready to drink.",France-Southwest France:Gros Manseng

It's full bodied, but has great acidity and a lively layer of tannins to keep it balanced and refreshing.",US-California:Pinot Noir

Leather and tar flavors emerge on the palate, but the fruits and spice characteristics are wound up in incredibly firm, mouth-drying tannins, which are overwhelming right now.",US-California:Syrah
"This opens with an attractive fragrance of ripe plum, violet, aromatic herb and baking spice. The straightforward palate offers dried black cherry, crushed raspberry, ground pepper and leather alongside polished tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit freshness.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Watercress and fleshy apricot meet in this wine and make that incongruous combination work. A savory undertone of yeast adds a deeper dimension where pepper, chervil, lovage and stone abandon themselves to riot. This so comes alive in the mouth and demands your attention. Wonderful balance, ripe fruit and a whole lot of savory play!",Austria-Kremstal:Grüner Veltliner
"Kudos to Chalk Hill for one of the drier, more subtle Chardonnays on the market. Theyve controlled the ripeness, reining in the tropical fruits to retain minerality, and allowing acidity to provide crispness. Nonetheless the wine impresses for opulence and complexity.",US-California:Chardonnay

"Shows plenty of oak influence, wrapping around tropical fruit notes. It's richly textured if somewhat low in acid, giving it a weighty feel on the palate. Drink now.",US-California:White Blend
"This is quite an interesting Pinot Noir. With a scent of mushrooms, cola and cherry pie and good acidity, it's Burgundian, with a pale color and a light, silky body. The alcohol is relatively high, but the wine wears it well. Although it's drinking well now, the wine should get a little better over the next 4–6 years.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Orange-red in color, this wine is dry, meaty and weighty, with a broadness on the palate. Peach skin and flesh are strongly represented in flavor, feeling at once refreshing and bold enough to stand up well to food.",US-California:Sangiovese

"Medium-weight (more Gamay than Cabernet in the heft department) with a soft, subtle dusty texture, this Rapel Valley Cab offers red-berry and dried-spice aromas, and red plum and cedar flavors. Goes down so easily that you just might forget that wine has alcohol in it. Best Buy.",Chile-Rapel Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A fine value, the 2009 Walla Walla Valley Cabernet is sourced from Spofford Station and Lefore vineyards. Bright and spicy, it spent 28 months in almost-neutral French oak. Cranberry and currant fruit is forward and precise, with the balance to age another 6–8 years.",US-Oregon:Cabernet Sauvignon

"A wealth of oak and tannin marks the entry of this wine, a blend of 62% Malbec with 30% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. It mellows on the midpalate, providing a more supple experience of baked plum, raspberry and coffee, finishing with a full-bodied flourish of vanillin toast.",US-California:Meritage
"This tight and firm Barbaresco from the Rio Sordo cru exhibits an orange tinge to its garnet color and shows aromas of licorice, exotic spice, old leather and dried tobacco leaf. The wine seems older than it actually is, but those polished tannins should pull it forward a few more years at least.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo

"Iris, pressed rose, pine forest, woodland berry and a balsamic note are just some of the inviting aromas you'll find on this delicious wine. The smooth concentrated palate doles out layers of raspberry compote, juicy Marasca cherry, cinnamon and clove framed in velvety tannins. A salty mineral note lingers on the finish. Drink through 2027.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Bracing and tightly wound, this opens with subdued aromas of pressed rose, resin and a whiff of exotic spice. The evolved palate isn't in sync with the nose, offering raisin and a touch of anise as well as aggressive, astringent tannins that give it an abrupt, raspy finish. It's already drying out so drink now.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Wood aging has given this wine some roundness and softness without taking away from the intense grassy, grapefruit flavors of Sauvignon Blanc. It has good richness as well as taut fruitiness.",France-Bordeaux:Sauvignon Blanc
"A good everyday red wine, rich and sweet in dark berrry, chocolate and smoked meat flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. It's soft and ready for drinking now.",US-California:Malbec
"Part of a single-vineyard library release, this affordable 21-year-old auslese offers a unique chance to taste through Riesling's longevity.

Expect to be pleased but not blown away.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"There's lots of forward raspberry, cherry and pomegranate fruit in this soft, lush wine. Oak brings an additional layer of richness. It's delicious—like toast spread with butter and jam—but a little one-dimensional. However, it's a wonderful dimension to explore now.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Succulent, dense and syrupy, this dessert Riesling brings a lush midpalate of honey, blossom, tea, candied citrus, butterscotch and more. It's loaded with flavor, just a little high-toned, and falls on the soft side for Washington dessert wines. But delicious? You bet!",US-Washington:Riesling
"Aromas of oak, espresso, steeped plum and cracked pepper lead the nose on this blend of 70% Negroamaro, 20% Montepulciano and 10% Malvasia Nera.

The flavors are vast and complex with raspberries, cherries and cola, but also forest notes of mushrooms, balsam and herbs. The acidity is fresh and appealing. It's gorgeous now, and should evolve over the next 15 years.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Cigar box, green olive, herbal notes and field scents define the bouquet on this single-vineyard Cabernet. With bright acidity, the palate displays raciness along with oak-driven flavors of chocolate, mint, vanilla and herbal berry fruits. A lasting finish is spicy, herbal and mildly green in flavor.",Argentina-Other:Cabernet Sauvignon
"When some of the greatest Cahors weigh in at 13.5% alcohol, there is no need for this 15.5% monster. It's a shame, because there is much to admire here, with the powerful bitter chocolate and the sweetest berry fruits, a wall of polished concentration. It needs aging for four years at least.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"There's a touch of soft cheese rind at first on the nose of this wine from the historic vineyard. It quickly emerges into a gray slate and white rock minerality, followed by warmed pears and apples. It's tightly focused on the steely, tense palate, with lime sorbet and green pear ripeness and a sunny body.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Ripe wild berry, dark spice and a whiff of leather unfold in the glass while the solid palate offers up stewed prune, vanilla and roasted coffee bean. Chewy tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2017.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Lagrein
"Bulky and rugged but sound, with some drying tannins on the finish. It compensates by offering attractive flavors of black cherries, black olives and hints of asphalt and garrigue. Try it with hearty braises or stews.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Off-dry Vouvray, with hints of honey, light on acidity and feeling soft. The wine needs to be drunk over the next year.",France-Loire Valley:Chenin Blanc
"The wine is soft, smooth and full of rich berry fruits. The blend of Aragonez, Trincadeira and Alicante Bouschet gives a warm southern feel: ripe wine, sunshine and soft tannins. Wood aging has smoothed the bold fruits and created a full generous aftertaste. Drink now.",Portugal-Península de Setúbal:Portuguese Red
"Rustic and somewhat sharp, this Zin has a green, spearmint streak, with some harsh tannins, which suggests unevenly ripened berries, despite very high alcohol. It's like a combination of cherry Lifesavers, blackberries and Altoids breath mints. Drink now.",US-California:Zinfandel
"With up to seven years' bottle aging, this is at a fine point between crispness and a fuller, more mature style. It is ripe with red fruits, cut with acidity and a hint of toastiness. Drink now.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend

"It's obvious there has been some oak aging here, because the wine is packed with spiciness and toast. That rather diminishes the fruit. Made to be drunk young, it may miss the target.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"From coastal hills near Jenner, this is true Sonoma Coast fruit, and it shows in its cool-climate embrace of red fruit and white pepper. Leather saddle marks the personality of the texture and soft acidity keeps it full-bodied and relatively dense.",US-California:Syrah
"Earthy, tarry plum and berry aromas are herbal and gritty. This is a forward Syrah with juicy acidity. Flavors of plum, currant, raspberry, tomato and herbs finish fresh, with lingering acids and spicy flavors that include fennel and licorice root. Drink this spicy, elegant Syrah now through 2017.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Syrah
"Roasted meat and spicy black-fruit scents are deep, lusty and patented for Volver, the winery that produces Triga. Chewy and thick on the palate, this blend of 85% Monastrell and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon tastes baked and peppery, with herbal notes blending into core black-fruit flavors.

"This is a sort of second tier wine from Talbott. It's a strongly flavored Chardonnay and extremely ripe, with pineapple jam, apricot-infused crème brûlée and sweet vanilla-butterscotch flavors. But for all the richness, it's crisp and bone dry. Easy to find, with 20,000 cases.",US-California:Chardonnay
"The nose of this dry Riesling is subdued with faint hints of blossom, wet stone and lime zest. The palate, however, is anything-but subdued, with ripe yellow-cherry and peach flavors that linger lusciously. Almost oily in texture, it's richly bodied, but brightened with a sheen of lemon-lime acidity.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"Danish sommelier-turned-winemaker Leo Hansen aims to make food-friendly wines, and this delicate Chenin is a great example.

"With aromas of honey, papaya and white flowers, this dry Moscatel from Málaga announces its ripe character. In the mouth, this is weighty and creamy more than racy and direct. Flavors of sweet melon and bitter peach pit come with anise and nutmeg, while the finish is long and offers a candied orange flavor.",Spain-Andalucia:Moscatel
"This bright, creamy sparkler offers delicate aromas and flavors of fragrant spring flowers, white peach, green apple and citrus. The rich flavors are brightened by brisk acidity while a foaming mousse adds finesse.",Italy-Veneto:Glera
"The savory, yeasty nose comes with a hint of spicy sandalwood. The palate echoes this rounded harmonious spiciness and plays more to those mellow tones than to the shades of fruit. The body comes with a lovely, inviting and appetizing light-footedness. The finish is long and clean.",Austria-Weinviertel:Grüner Veltliner
"This is not from a generally declared Port Vintage year. However, the year did produce some exceptional wines, such as this one. It has a firm tannic structure under opulent black fruits. Beautifully perfumed, ripe and likely to develop relatively quickly, this is already a balanced, approachable wine. Drink from 2019.",Portugal-Port:Port

"This soft, round wine is warm and full in the mouth, with only a hint of herbal character. Green fruits are filled out with ripe apricot and pear flavors. Drink this fruity, perfumed wine from 2016.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Toasty, charred aromas point at pencil lead and graphite in addition to inky black fruits. This old-vines Cabernet is voluminous but tight on the palate, with sandpaper tannins.

"From a vineyard and winery founded in 1996 by Judy Aron (one of the first women vintners in the region), this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 20% Malbec and 10% Petit Verdot shows fresh aromas of black plum, blueberry, violet, lava rocks and wet cement. The tannins are polished and soft, but provide a stiff-enough backbone to hold up black-currrant flavors that are enhanced with flashes of caramel.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This is an earthy and somewhat savory wine, buoyed by level acidity. It offers stewed lemon and fennel around a feral nose.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Even grapier than the Cabernet Sauvignon, this forward, light, candied, confected wine has a hole in the middle. The tannins turn quite astringent, a marked contrast to the sweetness of the fruit.",US-Washington:Cabernet Franc
This is a fragrant and creamy white wine with pretty floral tones backed by fresh fruit and citrus. Pair it with sushi or swordfish carpaccio.,Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Insolia

"This delightful wine, principally fermented in neutral oak, and aged sur lie, offers lovely details of apple flesh and skin, white melon, a hint of daikon radish, and the pinpoint persistence that is the mark of superior winemaking. Pinot Blanc can go in various directions in Oregon, but this bright and acidic wine really shows the way to a style that is at once drinkable, complex and food friendly.",US-Oregon:Pinot Blanc
"Exquisite lightness and weightless charm are the two obvious hallmarks of this wine. The merest touch of citrus appears on the nose.

"This wine by Adam Lee shows concentrated touches of nutmeg, crushed pepper and dried thyme laid across a base of hearty blackberries, with dried leaves on the nose.

A strong menthol lift arises on the finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"The wine is ripe, full of black-cherry fruits and with a substantial tannic core. At the same time, it does have the lighter style normally associated with red Pinot Noir. The aftertaste is ripe, fruity and rich with fruit. Drink from 2018.",France-Loire Valley:Pinot Noir

"Aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit, spice rack, grilled herb and a whiff of leather lead the nose of this blend of 85% Sangiovese, with 15% Colorino, Canaiolo and Merlot. The taut palate offers dried black cherry, espresso, aniseed and tobacco alongside bracing tannins that leave an astringent finish. Even though the tannins need to unwind, drink sooner rather than later to enjoy the remaining fruit richness.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Steely mineral notes accent luscious white grapefruit and yellow nectarine flavors on the nose of this delicate, yet lushly textured spätlese. It's softly sweet, with hints of honey and peach nectar, but bristling with acidity. A surprising bargain buy from Karl Josef.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling

"This bold wine has a very dark color and fresh, concentrated blackberry aromas. Generous berry and black pepper flavors seem to saturate the taste buds, leading to a lingering fruit and spice finish. The texture is almost viscous, as lots of fine tannins add grip. It's the rare wine with no added sulfites.",US-California:Merlot
"This aromatic wine offers notes of apricot, flowers and jasmine. It drinks off dry with abundant stone fruit flavors.",US-Washington:Riesling
"This is a taut, tight, dry Champagne, needing a few more years of bottle age. It has fine acidity, with a crisp lemon flavor and a lively mousse. With further maturity, it will develop into an intense, toasty Champagne of great quality.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Great price for a Chardonnay that tastes like it costs a lot more. Although it's unoaked, it's very rich in passionfruit, pineapple, peach and vanilla cream flavors, with a honeyed finish. Easy to find, with 5,000 cases produced.",US-California:Chardonnay
"You'll want to age this wine for a good 6–8 years, because right now it's rather tough in tannins, and the fruit and oak have not married. Nonetheless it's quite a good wine. Shows complex layers of blackberries, currants and caramelized oak. Lifts Alexander Valley Cabernet above its usual level into noteworthy.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Raspberry, white pepper, iron, dust and a Earl Grey tea element peek out from the delicate and restrained nose. Plums and red fruits mark the tip of the sip, but it clings to a gravelly, brick-laden center line of minerality, proving pleasantly peppery as well.",US-California:Barbera
"This interesting blend of Nero d'Avola and Pinot Nero (30%) recalls a California Pinot thanks to its rich color and density. You taste the purity of the berries but also get the heft and texture of a hot-climate red. Sweet candy and floral fragrances set the stage and the wine has a crisp, bright finish.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Red Blend
"The blend is 40% Syrah and 20% each Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese. It's difficult to find a focus here. Scents of breakfast tea and a lingering sour-candy fruit flavor are dominant, with fairly astringent tannins closing it down. Drink up.",US-Oregon:Red Blend
"There's lots to like about this cool-climate Chardonnay, from the ripe pineapple, kiwi and lime flavors to the rich touch of lees and vanilla. It has a sharp cut of acidity that's almost Champagne-like, and calls for extremely rich fare to balance. Try with shrimp risotto.",US-California:Chardonnay
"About half Merlot, with Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc making up the difference, this wine brings concentrated red cherry and currant notes to a mix of sawdust and anise on the nose.

Grippy tannins balanced by driving acidity make this wine a well-balanced showing from an environmentally-conscious, LEED Gold-certified winery.",US-Virginia:Meritage
"This medium-bodied wine has an earthy edge and a good core of cherry and plum flavors. A touch of barnyard in the aroma, and earthy, leathery flavors accompany a very smooth and relatively light mouthfeel.",US-California:Syrah

It's medium to full in body, has moderate tannins, good balance and a lingering finish.",US-California:Dolcetto
"Tastes unusual soft and melted for a Santa Lucia Highlands Syrah, but the blackberry, licorice, cola and sweet oak flavors sure are delicious. The absence of structure makes the wine finish  quick, and will not allow it to age, so drink up.",US-California:Syrah
"This wine shows grapey and plummy purple fruit notes lead to an earthy palate, with hints of stem and coffee. No new oak was used, but it spent 22 months in barrel prior to bottling.",US-Oregon:Syrah
"This isn't Coonawarra's most elegant wine, but it certainly doesn't lack for character or concentration. Menthol, vanilla, cedar and cassis deliver plenty of flavor in this chunky, full-bodied Cabernet. Charred, mocha-like notes emerge on the long, intense finish. Drink now–2025.",Australia-South Australia:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Dark, dense, rich and spicy, this Rhône-style blend is impressively delicious. Full bodied, it's saturated with blackberry, cinnamon and black-pepper flavors supported by fine-grained tannins. While it packs a punch, it is well balanced for a big, assertive wine, and will be best after 2019.",US-California:Red Blend
"Howard Park's single-vineyard wines continue to impress for their value and consistency. The 2004 Leston is a richly textured, velvety Cab, marked by earthy, loamy scents and classic cassis, vanilla and tobacco flavors. Drink 2009–2015.",Australia-Western Australia:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Features sweet fruit, plum, prune and a savory element of spice and smoke; loads of leather and tobacco as well. Deep rich, concentration and a plush, velvety feel. Oak tones must still integrate, but promise a nice future.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Brisk, citrusy acidity acts as a lever to the raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, lifting them to bright zestiness. The wine is a vintner's blend of barrels from across the large vineyard. There's a jammy directness that makes it instantly tasty, but it's not an ager. Drink now.",US-California:Pinot Noir
This is a good bargain for a varietal that's very difficult to make inexpensively. Whiffs of wood smoke meet ripe concentrated black-cherry flavors in this full-bodied smooth-textured wine. It has moderate fine-grained tannins for grip and a lingering spice and smoke finish.,US-California:Pinot Noir

"This wine has an impressively floral and savory fruit bouquet. Squashed mulberry, cherry blossom and black plum integrate expertly into a generous but judicious hickory-smoke element. Black plum baked in sesame sauce, beef char and roasted coffee notes sing together on the palate chorus, which is enhanced by a 9% Grenache.",US-California:Syrah
"From a vintage not known for its supersweet selections, this wine is a revelation. Honey and bergamot notes mingle easily on the nose, while the palate unfolds to reveal layers of honey, dried apricots and orange marmalade. It's rich, viscous and concentrated without any heaviness, with a finish that's sweet and lingering. This should age through 2040 easily.",Germany-Mosel-Saar-Ruwer:Riesling
"Floral red-fruit aromas get heavier with airing. Feels thick and full, with soft tannins and mild acidity.

"A lot of olive and herbs upfront, with cumin and other exotic, arguably unusual aromas.

"The hot conditions of 2009 are draped all over this rich, syrupy wine that's opaque to the eye and heavily charred on the nose.

"When California Riesling succeeds, it's because of wines like this, which hails from a well-farmed, cool-climate region. The two most important varietal elements, racy acidity and subtle flavor, both are here. The latter suggest peaches, Meyer lemons and wildflowers, with a rich undertow of stony minerals, and the finish is wonderfully bone dry. What a great restaurant wine.",US-California:Riesling
"Sweet and slightly viscous in texture, this wine lacks some aromatic flourishes, sacrificing complexity for purity of its pineapple, apple and citrus flavors. Yet because of its balanced, crisp acidity, the wine still sings, finishing long and mouthwatering. Drink now–2030.",Germany-Rheinhessen:Riesling

Best through 2021.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Raw oak, herb and floral aromas are complex and on the light side of the fence. This feels tight, tannic and edgy, while resiny oak gives off a lactic flavor to accompany core red plum and currant. This stays tight, punchy and drying on the finish. Drink through 2021.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend

The palate is more simple, with apple and lemon flavors and chalky texture.",US-California:Chenin Blanc
"This blanc de blancs, fermented and aged in wood, is a fine Champagne.

"An exceptionally fine Petite Sirah, except don't even think of opening it for a while. Made with a little Merlot, it's a dark, tannic wine, with complex flavors of blackberries, currants, plums, balsamic, tamari, cola, chocolate and dusty spices. But those pesky tannins sting the mouth. Give it until 2010, at least.",US-California:Petite Sirah

"Brut nature is a bone-dry style of Champagne, dry well beyond ordinary brut, which lends a steely refinement to the usual toast and fruit. This wine is absolutely built for oysters or caviar.

"The color and aromas are true to both Pinot Noir and Chile's Pinot-friendly Casablanca Valley. Dried fruit, citrus and pie cherry aromas take it toward a potpourri of red-fruit flavors. The only weakness is that the feel is a bit choppy and the finish goes heavy on the toast and woodspice. A good but imperfect effort at a more serious Chilean Pinot.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Pinot Noir

The balance is impeccable and the finish lingers.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon

This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors.

But the wine will develop fascinating bottle complexities for many years.",US-California:Petite Sirah

"Cloudy in color, with tart rhubarb aromas. The palate shows some acidity and tang, with pink grapefruit flavors offering a shrill kick. But overall the wine has seen better days and has become limited in scope at this point.",Spain-Central Spain:Tempranillo
Both ripe mirabelle and yellow juicy pear appear on the nose. The palate brims with the same fruit. The body is precise and fresh with a lip-smacking citrus finish.,France-Alsace:Pinot Blanc
"The nose on this blend of Gewurztraminer and Macabeo defines neutral; it's clean but shows little more than a whiff of apple. The palate is fresh and quick moving, with mild peach, pear, apple and melon flavors that culminate in a solid finish that's not very exciting but doesn't stray.",Spain-Northern Spain:White Blend
"This wine shows power and ripeness on the palate, with an oaky nuttiness on the nose. Lemony pear and stony minerality combine with a graham cracker creaminess, providing weight and length.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This is a rich wine that is full of spicy aromatic fruit. It is classy and elegant while having some weight. Red fruits and orange zest are given a perfumed herbal edge from the Mourvèdre in the blend. This is real food wine, ready to drink.",France-Provence:Rosé
"La Chablisienne vinifies this portion of Fourchaume premier cru separately, regarding it as almost grand cru in power. It is certainly a concentrated wine, very ripe, but lined with citrus acidity, crispness and structure. At the end, though, the richness comes out.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This lively, crisply acidic wine hints at toast, but goes much more for a delicious citrus character. There's a great freshness to the wine, showing some pear flavors and a fine edge of apple skins.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Perfumed in white flowers and apple blossom, this dark golden wine, aged in neutral oak, is soft and relatively light, a mix of ripe pear and vanilla.",US-California:Chardonnay

"This is an elegant, smooth wine with fresh clean fruit aromas. It has crispness, concentration and just a hint of spice.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Grigio
"The aromas of cracked peppercorns, iodine, blackberries, crushed stone, dried spices and black olives are practically intoxicating on their own. Then, on the palate, you can taste the intensity, with firm tannins that come from a patch of 50-year-old vines in Sorgues. Drink this blend of 60% Grenache, 25% Syrah, 10% Mourvèdre and 5% Cinsault from 2017–2025, treating it almost as if it were a mini Châteauneuf-du-Pape.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is a big Pinot Noir, with an explosive intensity of cherries and raspberries that is ripe and pure. Oak, of course, is there too, in the form of buttered, smoky toast. However, the wine isn't a mere fruit bomb. It has interesting nuances of earthy things, like mushrooms, nettles and Provençal herbs. The silky texture is an exquisite balance of acids and tannins. This new brand from Hall winery is made by their talented winemaker, Steve Leveque, and it immediately enters the California pantheon of excellent Pinot Noirs.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is a tasty and interesting medium-bodied wine made from Merlot, Cabernet Franc and a touch of the white grape Viognier. It doesn't overpower with ripeness or tannins, but has a smoky, spicy aroma, meaty flavors and a lively, slightly gripping texture.",US-California:Red Blend
"This crisp, clean, stainless-steel style of Chardonnay brings has mixed flavors of cucumber, celery, lime and light melon. It's fresh and immaculate—a wonderful sipper.",US-Washington:Chardonnay

"Grassy aromas feature a note of green banana and yeast. This feels round but hardly chunky, with reasonable core acidity. Flavors of citrus and apple are simple and clean, while a lemon-lime note and a hint of honey take care of the ending.",Chile-Leyda Valley:Chardonnay
"Lamborn has a knack for Zinfandel grown on Howell Mountain. The 2011 is dry, tannic and high in alcohol, but also concentrated with flavors of currants, blackstrap molasses, licorice and cedar. It could benefit from some time in the bottle so hold until 2016.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Intense with acidity and young fruitiness, this wine needs some time. The potential of the white and citrus fruit is there, with an herbaceous character that needs to soften. Drink from late 2015.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Made from free-run juice, this offers aromas of dried cherries, dessicated watermelon and clove. Plummy fruits and sour cherry show on the palate.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Jammy, somewhat green aromas are suggestive of tomato sauce with oregano and thyme. This feels full, creamy and thick, with earthy, herbal berry flavors that finish with creamy weight and chewy tannins.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon
"The hot vintage shows strongly, perhaps because this estate is located in the western part of Montalcino where elevations are lower and temperatures are a few degrees higher. The wine has a warm, brownish hue and delivers notes of mature black cherry, prunes and exotic spice. There's no freshness here and it won't last much longer.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso

"The subdued nose leads to a fresh, bright, easy-drinking palate dominated by lemony acidity. This is clean and refreshing. Drink soon.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"Potent black-plum and black-cherry aromas come with a ton of grainy, spicy oak. This is both fresh and bright as well as dark, brawny and roasted in character. Flavors of ripe blackberry and cherry share the stage with toasty, charred oak and spice flavors in front of an aggressive but tasty finish.",Spain-Northern Spain:Garnacha
"Pure Chardonnay from the walled vineyard in the heart of Le Mesnil, this intense wine from a great vintage is tight and mineral, still showing hints of toast from its barrel fermentation. With its taut texture, complex acidity and crisp citrus, it's very young, but will age indefinitely. Showing the beauty of Chardonnay in Champagne at its best, it will certainly still be impressive come 2030.",France-Champagne:Chardonnay
"Stainless-steel fermented, this crisp, thirst-quenching wine is fruity, floral and highly inviting, focused in well-defined flavors of tangerine and lemon. High in acidity without ever pushing too far, it remains complex and textured on the palate, finishing with a memorable tang.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Easy and fresh, with a simple, crisp finish, this should pair with garden greens or sliced tomato and mozzarella",Italy-Veneto:Pinot Grigio

"Aromas of citrus zest, peach and a whiff of tropical fruit lead the way. The rich palate delivers creamy apple, pear and lemon drop while brisk acidity and a firm perlage provide the framework. A saline note backs up the finish.",Italy-Veneto:Glera
"This super-smooth but hearty red blend made from Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre smells smoky, meaty and oaky. It tastes savory and a bit peppery before a good dose of ripe, plummy flavor joins in. It feels full-bodied, and almost soft in texture because of light tannins, but has enough acidity to keep an appetizing balance.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Very light in color and very crisp, clean and light in taste, this wine also delivers vivid raspberry flavors and great acidity. It stands out from the crowd for its elegance, balance and taut texture, while also delivering a mouthwatering finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is a fruit-driven, medium-bodied rosé of Grenache (60%) and Mourvèdre (40%). While not the most complex rosé, the yellow-fleshed, red-skinned plum flavors are potent, lingering on the mouthwatering finish.",France-Rhône Valley:Rosé
"Lightly charred aromas of coffee, wood smoke and chocolate outweigh berry and plum scents. A tight palate shows firm tannins and carries roasted berry and plum flavors.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"The wine is tart and pretty thin in citrus and peach fruit, leaving the oak to stick out. Still, it does show fine elegance and minerality.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Made in a very fruity style, with upfront, sweet pineapple, peach, green apple and honeysuckle flavors. Acidity provides some cleansing balance to the flamboyant richness.",US-California:Viognier
"All about fruit, this is a ready-to-drink Port, although it could also age. Red fruits and dried raisins are lifted by the intense acidity as well as the tannic structure, producing a wine that is on the dry side for Port. Because it is not filtered, the wine will throw a sediment; however, that also means that the wine could age, although it is delicious, ripe and fruity now.",Portugal-Port:Port

"This wine sources from both Montecillo Vineyard in Sonoma County and Georges III in Napa, bringing together one barrel of each for an herbal, savory and edgy experience. Cedar, clove and a healthy dose of fresh herb make it compelling in a classical sense.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Hard-coated cherry aromas are slightly medicinal and candied. A chunky but fairly bright palate delivers cherry, plum and spice flavors along with mild heat on the finish. This is good, standard stuff.",Spain-Central Spain:Garnacha
"This blend of Sangiovese and Merlot is almost too black, too concentrated and too extracted. Aromas are of blackberry pie and chewy tannins leave a gritty impression in the mouth.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Initial aromas of smoke and earth dissipate to reveal scents of rich, honeyed peaches and spice. The palate is bright and sweet with ripe, juicy stonefruit and preserved quince, accented by hints of fresh herbs and ramps. An unusual harmony of sweet and savory, it finishes long and complex.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"While the nose has a persistent apple cider quality, the palate brings a bit more nuance, with unripe peach and sweet-and-sour lemon flavors.",US-Michigan:Riesling
"A blend of several vineyards, this was aged for 17 months in French oak. The barrel influence is subtle, but the time in wood has helped to round out the tannins. The strawberry and raspberry fruit still has sharp edges and an herbal streak, bumping up against a smooth, chocolaty finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Smoke and dark earth, soft red berry fruit tip-toe onto the nose. Insinuations of wild and garden strawberries tumble forth on the palate as they are framed by the softest hints of vanilla and aromatic clove. This echoes long and draws you in. There is very distinct fruit at the core, alternating from ripe cherry at one moment to smoky plum the other. It scintillates. Drink 2018–2025.",Austria-Thermenregion:Pinot Noir
"Ripe fruit flavors and an easy but refined foamy texture make this light salmon-colored bubbly taste generous, complete, fruity and fresh. A touch of sweetness in the cherry and berry flavors keep the impression smooth and the flavors fruity through the finish.",US-California:Sparkling Blend

"With 50% of Arinto in the blend, this is rounder and richer in taste than many Vinhos Verdes. It does also have a crisp edge that comes from the citrus tang. The general effect is bright while full in the mouth from the delicious fruit. Drink now.",Portugal-Vinho Verde:Portuguese White

"This Cabernet Franc is beautiful, with incredible succulence, persistence, heat, power and a full plate of enticing fragrances. Coffee, root beer, chocolate, Nutella, graham cracker and cherry liqueur are only a few elements of the wine's complexity.",Italy-Tuscany:Cabernet Franc
"Tropical fruit flavors abound throughout in this balanced, straightforward wine. Simple yet attractive, it can be used as an apertif or for casual dining. Spicy shellfish dishes, especially coconut shrimp, would pair well with this.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Chardonnay
"Maybe it's the Viura, becuase this $9 wine seems cleaner, rounder and slightly better than the winery's higher-priced pure Verdejos. Look for generic but fresh peach and citrus aromas and then lip-smacking citrus flavors. Finishes composed and clean, with lasting grapefruit flavor. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.",Spain-Northern Spain:Verdejo-Viura
"Crusty berry aromas mesh with olive, mineral notes and leather to form a textbook Chilean Cab bouquet. The palate feels fresh and offers kick via tomatoey acids. Flavors of dried cherry, herbs, fresh tomato and mint end in a good feeling finish with mild herbal leftovers.",Chile-Aconcagua Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Made from 100% Cab, the grapes once again show what the vineyard, in the hills east of the Silverado Trail, can do. The French oak was 90% new, which would swamp a lesser wine, but not this one. It's rich, full and concentrated, with excellent structure and balance. Drink now, after careful decanting, and through 2020.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Light in color, this has a nose that's defined by a leafy, herbal red-fruit aroma and a rubbery scent. The palate is light in feel and drying, with a spicy, dry red-fruit flavor and a buttery oak tone. Mellow and leafy on the finish.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Merlot
"Simple at best early on, with leathery, rustic aromas and a truly basic set of flavors. Should you allow it to breathe, it rounds into a good (but still basic), semisoft and fruity red with solid cherry/berry flavors and nothing offputting.",Spain-Northern Spain:Red Blend

"Citrus zest, pineapple and oak aromas carry over to the lean, linear palate, joining hints of toasted nut and vanilla. Brisk acidity provides the racy framework.",Italy-Lombardy:Turbiana

"This inky-black Barbera boasts granite and slate aromas with black fruit, cassis, wild mushroom, tobacco and wet earth. These are the characteristic aromas of this native grape variety, although the deep extraction and sweet oak flavors on display here denote a very modern interpretation.",Italy-Piedmont:Barbera
"This is a structured and beautifully wood-aged wine. It comes from vineyards high up in the hills above the Douro, giving a balanced character to the wine.

"A vibrant, racy Sauvignon Blanc with concentrated notes of white grapefruit, herbs, and onion peel. It's mouthwatering and richly flavored with mineral notes speckling the finish.",US-Oregon:Sauvignon Blanc

It's chewy and muscular, an interesting debut for the winery.",US-Washington:Malbec
"A solid rendition of Verdejo with apple and pear aromas along with basic minerality. The palate is standard and firm, with good acidity pushing apple and citrus flavors. Perfectly competent but not showing the nuances and higher qualities that would justify a $17 outlay.",Spain-Northern Spain:Verdejo
"This blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot saw 31 months in French oak and another two years in bottle prior to release. There's plenty of detail to the concentrated coffee, cherry, graphite and blackberry aromas and flavors that reflect perfect balance. It's drinking exquisitely now but has a long life in front of it.

"Here's a Pinot with some varietal character, namely silky tannins, soft acids, and flavors of cherries and cola. Goes the extra mile with some additional depth of flavor and pretty oak, but it's awfully hard to get a good Pinot at this price.",US-California:Pinot Noir

It's equally impressive on the palate with smooth, thick intensity.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"An unusual find of an old vintage currently available, this is certainly a mature wine. In fact, it is beginning to dry out—focused on old tannins rather than on the wonderful secondary flavors of a well-aged Bordeaux. For lovers of older wines, this is a bargain curiosity.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The Mazzei brothers produce a Vermentino of depth, brightness and persistency. It delivers long-lasting flavors of citrus, peach and orange skin.",Italy-Tuscany:Vermentino

With thick tannins but a silky texture, it offers waves of raspberries, cherries, currants, pomegranates, baker's chocolate and cola.

"You want to give this wine 5–6 years in the cellar, at the very least, to let its components come together. At the moment, it's quite dry, acidic and oaky. Primary fruit flavors of raspberries and cherries should begin to develop bottle complexity by 2017.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"This is not a showy wine, but the sense of reserve, good acidity, fresh flavors and good balance form an enjoyable picture that will be versatile with food.",US-California:Chardonnay
"The moated fairy-tale castle of Agassac is a showpiece of the Médoc. This wine is structured, juicy and firm.

"Bright aromas of peach, pear and nectarine are followed by lightly sweet fruit flavors. It brings some appeal but the apparent residual sugar gets in the way.",US-Washington:Viognier
"This wine pulls off a daring feat: despite palate weight and concentration it has a light, almost delicate, feathery citrus touch and a streamlined, fresh palate.

"A well-made wine, showing lots of terroir in the mineral-infused blackberry, black currant, chocolate and anise flavors. The tannins are structurally superb, while the finish is dry and complex. A very fine wine that should gather momentum for at least a decade.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of tobacco, dried herbs and strawberry are followed by focused, creamy-feeling raspberry and cranberry flavors. It shows a real sense of purity but the mouthfeel is where it truly shines.",US-Washington:Grenache

"Light, bright and fruity, this has soft tannins, plenty of red fruits and balancing acidity. Just dry to finish, it is ready to drink now.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"This cleverly named wine, which is a blend of several vineyards, is an astounding value. It comes very close to the quality of Pali's single-vineyard, far more expensive Pinots, with complex cherry, cola and smoky cedar flavors. Absolutely one of the best under-$20 Pinots in California.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This seems heavy and sweet for a Pinot Gris, with flavors of white sugar, orange and vanilla.",US-California:Pinot Gris
"This ripe, bold wine is full of rich red fruits and soft tannins. Light wood aging (six months) smoothed out the tannins for a balance of spice, ripe berry fruits and acidity. Drink now.",Portugal-Dão:Portuguese Red
"This is ripe in cherry and red currant flavors, with a smoky, bacony touch from the charred oak. The mouthfeel is marked by edgy tannins. Drink now.",US-California:Merlot
"Herb aromas and veggie flavors dominate this light-bodied wine. Not much fruit flavor peeks through the herb garden, but the lean white pepper notes and crisp texture are appealing.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Made in a sweet, candied style, with flavors of pineapples, mangoes, roasted almond granola and vanilla. Could almost serve as a dessert wine. Drink now.",US-California:Rhône-style White Blend
"Opens with a pretty shade of gold that denotes more sophisticated extraction and in fact that impression is carried through to the nose and mouth where the wine exhibits ripe fruity aromas, honey, almond skin, dried herbs and natural rubber. The mouthfeel is thin, but remains a step above the commercial Pinot Grigio that is so commonly available. The wine is packaged with a real vine clipping around the bottle neck.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Grigio
This is a beautiful red blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon from the Montalcino subzone of Sant'Antimo (where super Tuscan wines are made) with light mineral dustings that show delicately over a solid core of black fruit and exotic spice. The mouthfeel is bright and polished.,Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Grenache (56%) takes the lead on this blend, which also includes Syrah, Mourvèdre, Counoise and Cinsault. It offers aromas of celery salt, coffee and dark berries. The palate brings fruit flavors that display the best this vintage has to offer—richness without excessive weight. The finish persists.",US-Washington:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Here's a southern Italian red with Barolo-like austerity: elegant notes of small berry fruit are seamlessly folded within layers of slate roof, ash, graphite, licorice and fine expressions rendered by volcanic soils and 18 months of oak aging. It really comes alive in the mouth, where the wine delivers power, concentration and a very long-lasting finish. This is Mastroberardino's flagship red.",Italy-Southern Italy:Aglianico
"This fruit-forward, entry level release is nonetheless all estate grown and spent just under a year in French oak. It's a supple flavorful mix of plum and cherry fruit, accented with iron filings, lead pencil and dark chocolate.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This single-block bottling, though tasty, is a less complete wine than the Cuvée. Here the bright raspberry fruit is tight and constrained a bit, with an abundance of tart acids. Just a light hint of chocolate comes up in the finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Sierra Cantabria's wines are usually so good that one that's simple, tasty and regular such as this might get overlooked. But if you want an honest crianza with touches of balsam wood, bacon and rubber as well as dry plum and cherry fruit, this is it. Finishes peppery, with full tannins and oak-driven mocha flavor.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend

"Balanced sweetness and pure fruity freshness personify this surprisingly elegant bargain buy. The palate bursts of fresh pear, grapefruit and tangerine flavors accented by a glaze of waxy lemon peels. Bristling acidity leads a long, revitalizing finish.",Germany-Pfalz:Riesling
Grapy aromas of black cherry are young and fruity but unsophisticated. This everyday Tempranillo is more superficial than deep in build. Sweet as well as peppery black-fruit flavors finish mild.,Spain-Central Spain:Tempranillo
"Spunky and mildly abrasive on the nose, this has some punch and character. It feels fresh, lean and narrow, with a traditional Rioja mix of herb-influenced red-fruit and dry spice notes. The mild finish offers tobacco and raspberry flavors.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Darker and more brooding than many of Newsome-Harlow's other single-vineyard bottlings in the 2011 vintage, the Shake Ridge is mighty in black pepper and dark chocolate, silky and voluptuous with mellowed tannins. Blended with 8% Petite Sirah, the ranch's Zin clones include Monte Rosso.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Luminous and fresh, this is a classic Prosecco with all the lively effervescence and the cheerful personality you can expect from this popular Italian sparkler. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth and offers plenty of citric freshness.

"Fairly simple in appeal, with candied, sweet and sour cherry flavors, like a cough drop. Tannic, too, hitting the palate with sandpapery astringency. But earns extra credit for dryness and a rich smoked meat note that makes it a partner for barbecue.",US-California:Zinfandel
"The bouquet on this Cava is a bit gaseous, with mild lime and apple aromas. In the mouth, it's foamy but fresh and lifted. Flavors of candied apple and mango finish in sweet fashion. Nice for Cava but with limits.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"This wine opens in candied ginger and orange peel, invitingly light in color and weight, with elegance at its core. Silky texture wraps around plum, sage and that classic notion of forest floor.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah, with slightly more of the former. It hinges on large swathes of barbecue smokiness and heaping grilled meat, with a baseline of licorice and vanilla-laced tannin that can sometimes overwhelm.",US-California:Red Blend
"A blend of 80% Chardonnay and 20% Pinot Bianco, this has sensations of yellow apples, beeswax, citrus and mineral. It's simple but well made and would work well with lightly seasoned fish or pasta dishes topped with vegetable sauces.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:White Blend
"Made from Pinot Noir grapes, this is a somewhat reduced, concentrated wine, copper-orange in color, that's intensely meaty, with a suggestion of hazelnuts and earth. Despite its powerful palate, it finishes lean and dry.",US-California:Rosé
"Apple aromas come with a mild but noticeable burn. This feels dense and thick, with creaminess to the palate. Flavors of pear, melon and banana slow down and thicken up on the finish, which is round and not at all complex.",Spain-Northern Spain:Chardonnay
"Not very expressive, but this wine's fragrance does reveal delicate aromas of rose and berry, which carry over to the palate. It doesn't have quite enough fruit richness to support the vigorous, almost aggressive, bubbles and drying finish.",Italy-Lombardy:Sparkling Blend
"Upon opening, it's compact and tangy, with deep fruit flavors of raspberry, red plum and pie cherry. There is a lot of life to this wine, with fresh and clean fruit flavors. It needs time to develop in the bottle. A blend of 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc and 33% Merlot.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Slightly sweet and quite light in body, this wine has modest peach and herb aromas, generic fruit flavors and a soft texture.",US-California:Riesling
"The winery's style is a leaner, more minerally and elegant Chardonnay, rather than the blowsy, ripe kind so popular these days. This '09 is quite fine, with brisk acidity and a steely tang to the orange and apricot flavors. Drink over the next three years with shellfish in cream and butter sauces.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This wine comes from a small parcel of 41-year-old vines in the Muraires vineyard. It has concentration, richness and a structured character that suggests aging potential. Of course, this impressive wine is ready to drink now for its freshness.",France-Provence:Rosé

"This driving blend of Malbec with Syrah and Cabernet hails from Argentina's most northern vineyards.Bruising black plum and cassis aromas have mossy, floral sidenotes.

"Pungent jasmine and orange blossom take hold of the nose right away, ensuring that this won't be one of those flavorless Pinot Grigios to forget. On the palate, roasted pear and slight toffee tones mingle with lemon-lime acidity, making this wine a nice fit for backyard gatherings featuring shrimp on the barbie.",US-California:Pinot Grigio
"This is a typical, standard style of Syrah, that tastes strongly of vanilla rather than of the actual grape. The fruit is muted, but the vanilla and tobacco flavors stand out.",US-Washington:Syrah
A brief period of wood aging delivers soft tannins and juicy blackberry fruits to this ripe wine. A streak of acidity gives the powerful wine a crisp edge. Drink now.,Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red

"Rich berry and graham-cracker aromas announce a ripe, easygoing Monastrell-Syrah blend. Chewy and slightly sinewy in feel, this offers heaps of tasty but creamy oak and vanilla to go with spicy, herbal berry fruit. A creamy, thick finish is fitting for a warm-climate wine like this.",Spain-Levante:Red Blend
"This is a rich and luscious wine dominated by Petit Manseng, a small berry/small-yield grape from Gascony, the home of unusual grapes. It's aromatic, ripe and honeyed with ripe peach cut by the pineapple freshness. It's a gorgeous wine now but it really should be aged so drink from 2020.",France-Southwest France:Gros and Petit Manseng
"Quinta Nova has produced two Grand Reservas in 2012. This is leaner than the other, a more structured wine with dry tannins and great concentration. It will need several years to soften and bring out its natural mineral richness. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red

"Very smooth, yet mouth-drying with firm tannins, this Cabernet is a bit lean, but it defines the elegance that Napa is capable of. The blackberry and currant flavors are balanced by earthier notes of green olives, cola and dried herbs, while the oak is subtle, even though it's all new.

Blended from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, it will improve in the bottle over the next eight years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Bordeaux-style blend leads with 50% Cabernet Sauvignon. Very dark in color and potent in flavor, the wine has grand proportions but is finely polished, leaving no rough edges.

"Tasting similar to Chardonnay, this has a buttery, creamy texture that frames orange, citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It gains extra points for delicacy and balance. The appellation is in San Benito County, about 25 miles inland from Monterey.",US-California:Pinot Blanc
"Blackberry and cassis aromas are robust and typical for Toro. In the mouth, however, this is super tannic and like gravel. Dark berry flavors are well oaked, while the finish tastes of blackberry and chocolate but feels tannic as nails. Drink or hold; this will always be a rough wine.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tinta de Toro
"This weighty Malbec is more rough than refined, but what's here is decent. The nose is round and full of plum and berry aromas, while there's a full blast of berry fruit along with detectable oak on the palate. The finish is basic and clean, with some buttery oak on the very back.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Malbec
"Ripe and juicy, this offers aromas of pressed spring flower and yellow stone fruit. On the bright palate, a note of candied nectarine zest accents ripe yellow apple and dried apricot.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Grigio
"A superripe structured wine that has serious tannins and a smoky dark character. Right now, the tannins dominate the otherwise fruity wine, but with some time it will soften and balance out. Drink this powerful wine from 2024.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is an eccentric wine, showing oaky flavors along with marzipan and oranges. It's quite dry and acidic, with a steely tang. But it seems tired and a little oxidized. Drink up.",US-California:Marsanne
"Funky aromas of farmyard, overripe berries and plums, vanilla and oak all carry over to the palate along with wild cherry and cinnamon notes. It's shy on fresh acidity, while astringent tannins lead to a drying close.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This Viura smells waxy and oxidized for a 2011. The palate feels chunky and awkward, while the flavor profile deals maderized pear and apple.",Spain-Northern Spain:Viura

"This full-bodied, ripe, lush wine boasts layers of peach and pineapple fruit that verge on being overly tropical, but has an edge of citrusy acidity that pulls it back from the brink. Delicious over the next year or two.",New Zealand-Hawke's Bay:Chardonnay
"Dineen and Red Willow 'Les Vins de Marcoux' supply the fruit for this complex, aromatic Syrah. A fecund melding of compost, chicken yard and chocolate accents surround a core of berries and cherries. Ripe, round and mouth-filling, it's not at all overpowering, but has the style and complexity to hold your interest through the entire bottle.",US-Washington:Syrah
"This is a pretty good price for an everyday, introductory Pinot Noir. It shows proper qualities of dryness, silkiness and cherry cola flavors, enhanced with oaky notes.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This wine is 29% each Mourvèdre and Syrah with the rest equal parts Cinsault, Counoise and Grenache. Aromas of vanilla, coconut and red and black fruit lead to a full-bodied, creamy palate that mixes fruit and barrel flavors. The wood influence is strong but the fruit largely stands up to it.",US-Washington:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Smoky and soft, this boldly made wine is medium-bodied but burly in char, baked blackberry and cocoa powder, a hint of tobacco never far.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of oak, toast, espresso, vanilla and coconut carry over to the palate along with dark berry flavors and milk chocolate. It closes on a sweet, almost sugary note but it lacks energy and intensity.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Old-vine Grenache (80%, the balance is Syrah) aged in old oak casks has resulted in a wine textured like heavy cream or velvet, with the merest hints of vanilla and cedar to the cherry fruit. Lingers elegantly on the finish.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend

"Very crisp and slightly sweet, this simple, everyday Chardonnay has jammy flavors of pineapples, apples and lemon tarts. Pretty good for the price.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Subtle aromas of mulberry, mace and vanilla meet with more intriguing notes of animal blood, rust and iodine on the nose of this bottling by Jennifer Hoage. Snappy and tart raspberry pops on the palate alongside forest underbrush and sandalwood. It's a great, balanced and even-handed entry point for those looking to explore the less ripe side of the grape.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is smoky and minerally upfront, influenced by barrel notes, but there's also some intense strawberry and raspberry fruit on the palate and a minerally reprise on the concentrated finish.",France-Provence:Rosé
"This lightweight wine is dominated by juicy red fruit. Fresh in character, it has bright acids and soft tannins. Not a wine for aging.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A potentially polarizing wine, the 2005 Idyll Vineyard Shiraz boasts a complex bouquet that ranges from meaty and gamy to stewed fruit and coffee and green olive. It's likeable in a stinky-cheese way. In the mouth, the tannins are soft and Pinot-like, but the wine does show a trace of heat, adding a chocolaty note on the finish.",Australia-Australia Other:Shiraz
"Unctuously ripe yellow peach and cherry aromas entice on the nose of this sprightly late-harvest Riesling. It's semi-sweet and fruity, with tart tangerine acidity that takes the spotlight on the palate. A refreshing, tasty quaffer for a remarkable price.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"This is a yellow fruit and spice flavored wine. It is rich, just cut with acidity and with rounded fruit flavors and a generous texture. It is an impressive development from a young, crisp Muscadet and shows how well some wines from the region can age. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley:Melon
"Alan Limmer of Stonecroft was the first modern grower of Syrah in New Zealand, planting his first vines in 1984. While the winery has changed hands, it's still a good source for Syrah. This bottling is appropriately smoky and peppery, with hints of bacon fat and blueberries, and a lingering, softly dusty finish.",New Zealand-Hawke's Bay:Syrah
"It's difficult to see how this wine can register alcohol almost 15%. Flavors are thin, green and tannic, with hardly a hint of fruit.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon

"This fresh wine also offers plenty of ripe fruit and exotic flavors. Crisp, juicy and rich, it's just lightly touched by honey and is a refreshing wine to drink now.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Here's a serious Cava with Champagne qualities. The nose is nutty and rich, with hints of vanilla and popcorn that aren't overdone. The palate is toasty but also candied, with citrus blending perfectly with butterscotch. Plump and ripe through the finish, this is high-end and stylish, as Spanish bubbly goes. Drink now or hold in a good cellar for a few more years.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"Cool briary plum and blackberry aromas show lactic, creamy oak, which is nothing unusual for Cobos. Plump, dense and saturated in the mouth, this block-selection Malbec is extremely ripe, with medicinal black fruit and raisiny flavors touched up by mocha and peppery spice. An oaky, spicy finish is par for the course. Drink through 2021.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec

"Smoked oregano, black plum, dark berries and loamy soil notes come through on this bottling by one of this appellation's original families. Dark plum, blackberry, crushed black rocks, iron and touches of dried mint and white sage come through on the savory palate. This bottling aims more for power than finesse in this variable grape.",US-California:Grenache
"While this wine is dry and crisp with acidity, it straddles the border of ripeness. On the plus side are vibrant lemon, lime and honey flavors. On the downside is a green, feline streak.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc

"Alienor Grand Vin hails from Kelseyville, in Lake County, a fine place for Bordeaux varieties. A blend of 51% Merlot, 48% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot, this is highly structured with a lot of herbal intensity. The typical fruit forwardness of many California reds is subdued; the wine may need time for the fruit to make its way through.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This balanced, fruity wine has gentle tannins and juicy red fruit flavors. It's fresh with acidity and a floral character that makes it already drinkable.",France-Southwest France:Red Blend
"The local grape Négette is a major party in this blend alongside Syrah and Malbec. This is a perfumed, ripe wine that has more generous fruit than tannin. Red berries dominate alongside acidity and a mineral-textured character. It's still fresh, fruity and needs time. Drink from 2017.",France-Southwest France:Red Blend
"With a high proportion of Pinot Meunier in the blend, this is ripe, warm and accessible. Fresh apple and ripe pear flavors are cut by grapefruit acidity. The texture is soft, ripe and very ready to drink.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend

"Terra di Lavoro (a blend of Aglianico and Piedirosso) is packaged in a handsome bottle and opens with inky, dark richness. The well concentrated wine is redolent of espresso bean, rum cake, chocolate, leather and moist pipe tobacco. The sweet tannins are very astringent still so give this wine time to soften.",Italy-Southern Italy:Red Blend

"Aromas of underbrush, leather, oak spices and espresso lead the nose on this structured wine. The firm palate is still tightly wound, revealing roasted coffee bean, licorice, dried cherry and assertive tannins. Drink 2018–2023.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This is a ripe and full-bodied; it benefitted from the warm vintage, offering rich yellow-fruit flavors to go with its touches of toast and sweet herb. On the finish, acidity and minerality come forward to suggest its aging potential.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"One of many excellent values to be found among the 2012 Southern Rhône wines, this is supple in style, with ripe cherry and chocolate accented by vanilla and sandalwood. Drink now–2016.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Toasty, oaky aromas of graphite, pepper, barrel char and black fruits properly announce a palate of chewy tannins and several layers of blackberry, cassis, barrel-spice, toast and chocolate flavors. Chocolaty depth on the finish only adds to the package. Drink through 2030.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo

"Heavy and sweet, almost sugary in blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors, with a smoky, hot finish. A good wine that will appeal to those who like its candied taste.",US-California:Red Blend

"This wine is very fresh and crisp, with plenty of fresh herb aromas and vibrant grapefruit flavors. Light bodied and well balanced, it has good acidity and a snappy finish.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc

"Simple and fresh, this offers the easy-drinking experience that has made Prosecco Superiore a world-wide sensation. Thanks to its peach and citrus aromas, this should go down beautifully with a simple platter of grilled vegetables.",Italy-Veneto:Glera
"A gentle hint of soft and mellow vanilla frames the ripe, red-cherry fruit that appears readily on the nose. The palate discloses that same mix of fruit and oak influence, wrapping fresh cherry, both tart and ripe, in a rounded, smooth cloak of smoky vanilla. Tannins are fine and gentle. This wine is both fresh and fruity, with a bright, fresh finish.",Austria-Burgenland:Pinot Noir
"The aromas bring a big whack of pungent blue and purple fruit, along with notes of herb and cherry. The flavors are full and palate coating, bringing a real sense of texture and hedonism but still with great freshness.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"This wine is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from Champoux, Palengat and Wallula vineyards, all located with the Horse Heaven Hills appellation. Aromas of incense, dark fruit, licorice and barrel spice rise up from the glass, which also reveals penetrating cherry and anise notes. The flavors are rich and concentrated but far from over the top, with expertly integrated tannins. It brings a very pleasing sense of texture. Just a baby now, but it has the stuffing to go the distance. Best from 2027–2033.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A deep raspberry flavor is set in a vivid frame of spicy herb and toasty barrel accents. The finish is crisply defined, with slightly peppery tannins.",US-Washington:Petit Verdot
"This Riserva is measured in terms of its aromatic intensity and although it does deliver cherry, spice and warm notes of leather and almond, it does so in a very understated manner. The more you get to know it in the glass, the more you can identify delicate floral and ethereal aromas that point to a traditional Chianti Classico style. Sharp acidity and bright fruit flavors tell the same story in the mouth.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This copper-colored wine has good, light cherry and apple aromas, and fresh, tangy but lean fruit flavors. It is nicely dry, well balanced and a bit crisp in texture.",US-California:Rosé
"Attractively ripe aromas of melon and softly baked apples lead the nose, with a touch of sweet smokiness, almost like cured bacon, following close behind. Medium weight with balanced, lifting acidity and a spice-infused clementine rind finish.",South Africa-Stellenbosch:Chenin Blanc

"This is a very lively wine with a creamy mousse. The wine is towards dry, bringing out great white and citrus fruit flavors with a burst of tangy acidity. It comes from the village of Chouilly in the Côte des Blancs, which gives the wine a tight mineral texture at the end.",France-Champagne:Chardonnay
"Some vegetal and mint aromas and flavors compromise this otherwise fruity Pinot Noir. Its cherry pie notes are enriched with caramelized oak, but the total effect is labored.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A note of brine rests on top on an otherwise dry, earthy, red-fruit bouquet. Punchy tannins create mild pinch, while earthy plum flavors carry a note of leather. A crisp, zesty finish with mild oak and spice notes closes this out.",Chile-Maule Valley:Pinot Noir
"Avignonesi takes a traditionalists' approach to most of its wines, including this ruby-colored Rosso di Montepulciano. Slightly muddled aromas of cherry and dried raspberry mingle with tobacco, leather and spice.",Italy-Tuscany:Prugnolo Gentile

The flavors warm up toward cooked apples, seared pears and nectarine flesh, rounded out by a touch of buttercream.",US-California:Grenache Blanc
"Extraordinarily rich, complex and delicious,  this wine defines a ripe approach to cool-climate Pinot Noir. In its youthful state, it's plastered over with smoky oak, but below that are abundant ripe red and black cherry flavors. Near-perfect acids and tannins create wonderful balance and harmony in this ageworthy wine. Cellar Selection.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"From the Stoney Vine vineyard, this shows the effects of a cool vintage on young vines. There's a lot of citrus and pineapple throughout, and the berry fruit flavors, characteristic of Syrah, are present in the background. There are pleasing accents of carpaccio and peat moss, and just a hint of Bourbon from the third-use, Wisconsin oak barrels. This definitely needs extensive breathing time, or further bottle age.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Scents and flavors suggest cherry pipe tobacco, along with streaks of dried leaf and lemon oil. It's a rough and tumble, every day red, with some chewy tannins.",US-Oregon:Cabernet Sauvignon

"A site planted to the Rued clone of Chardonnay in classic Russian River Valley Goldridge soils, Searby is expressive in honeysuckle and orange blossom floral tones. This balanced wine is soft and round, its time in oak reaching an apex on the finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"The distinct smell of fresh asphalt along with leather, burnt coffee, charred oak and black cherry make up the nose. In the mouth, this wine is wiry and acidic. Spiced black-plum flavors are peppery, riding a beam of acidity on a finish that could use more weight and tannins for balance. Drink through 2024.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Syrah
"While a bit restrained in style, this dry easy-going Riesling offers delicate shades of tangerine and yellow-apple flavor augmented by zesty lime and lemon acidity. Crisp texture and a soft bristle of lime zest lend a vibe to the finish.",US-New York:Riesling
"This wine seems quite reduced out of the gate, delivering aromas that prove distracting. The palate shows more depth with an array of pleasing dark fruit flavors.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Cherries, leather and earth all mingle on the nose and palate of this medium-bodied wine. It's a pleasant, easy-to-drink offering, even if it's not terribly concentrated or complex. Drink now.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Light and luminous in appearance, this bright Rosso di Montalcino delivers subdued aromas of raspberry, cherry, cola and wet earth. None of these aromas are particularly intense, but they are balanced.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Ripe and soft on the nose, this blend of Monastrell, Garnacha and Syrah is so easygoing that it lacks pop up front. Plump and fruity on the palate, this is low on structure and acidity. Jammy raspberry and strawberry flavors end in friendly fashion, but with low definition. Drink now.",Spain-Levante:Red Blend
"At an impressive 13-years-old, this deeply golden-hued wine opens with subtle aromas of toasted nut, pressed acacia flower and honey. The round, evolved palate still boasts freshness while the tertiary flavors include lemon zest, ginger, smoky mineral and a hint of marzipan.",Italy-Southern Italy:Fiano

"While this wine has fruit and a juicy apple flavor, it also displays a less attractive earthy character. This may decrease after a few more months in bottle.",France-France Other:Vermentino
"Muted citrus and white-fruit aromas blend on the nose with briny sea notes. This offers a plump palate and flavors of bitter citrus, salt and pepper. A sense of citrus skins creates pulling tension on the finish.",Chile-Limarí Valley:Chardonnay
"This is an oaky, woody and somewhat harsh white wine, made with the addition of 8% Sémillon.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Raisin cake and dried cherry are highlighted in this fairly light expression of what can otherwise be a hearty variety, buoyed by a brightness of acidity. Vanilla and plum add to the mix, as soft, supple tannins support the weight and breadth of an approachable wine.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"Despite its light touch, this is fruity and full, with its blackberry fruit dominating the warm spice note and acidity. Soft tannins keep the wine together. Drink now. Screwcap.",Portugal-Lisboa:Portuguese Red

"The blend here is two-thirds Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Cabernet Franc. Tight and toasty, it carries a hint of green tannins that show up in an astringent, lightly chalky finish. The fruit is sharp and herbal, with a suggestion of heat.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This easy-to-drink Merlot is lusciously forward in blackberries and cherries, yet has extra qualities of structural complexity that recommend it. Beyond the sweetness are rich tannins, just-in-time acidity and a subtle floweriness of rose petals and violets.",US-California:Merlot
"Showing beautifully, with intense lemon and lime fruit and a luxurious texture. The chalky, minerally palate is saved from austerity by a touch of sweetness. A very nice package.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"The wine is all richness—loaded with botrytis and concentration. With its balanced acidity and dried fruit flavors, it's ripe, gorgeous and developing well, if slowly. This will be a great wine, but wait until 2024 to open it.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A fair amount of the cuvee is from the 130-year-old Grandpère vineyard, which lends a soft, herbal, grassy undertone to the wine. From elsewhere comes bright cherry fruit, and the wine seems a little disjointed, though it may come together in time. Some nail polish in the nose carries through to the finish.",US-California:Zinfandel
"A bone-dry, slightly green Sauvignon Blanc, with lemongrass and gooseberry flavors, boosted with vibrant acidity. Feels elegant and sleek, but won't appeal to everyone. The grapes for this unoaked wine came from Sonoma and Lake counties.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"While the nose on this unoaked Chardonnay is exuberant with billowing, ripe yellow stonefruit and floral aromas, the palate is quite brisk in style with a lean, steely acidity. Dry and medium bodied, it's an exceptionally elegant Chardonnay.",US-New York:Chardonnay

"Clarissa Nagy, whose main job is making wine for Riverbench, sources grapes from the nearby Garey Ranch Vineyard for this bottling.

"Rich and with good fruit, this is a structured wine that has the density to age well. The dark-chocolate flavors mingle with the black-plum fruits, finishing with just a light lift of acidity.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This Barolo has typical varietal aromas of rose and a hint of leather, but shows the heat of the 2007 vintage in its overripe black fruit and spice accompanied by a warm midpalate. The finish is abrupt, marked by bitter, green tannins.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"An intriguing wine, this boasts herbal-, tobacco- and truffle-laced aromatics backed by a modicum of cassis fruit and a wonderfully soft, creamy, supple texture. The flavors also veer dangerously close to vegetal, so if you insist on no green notes in your Cab, search somewhere else.",Australia-South Australia:Cabernet Sauvignon

"The Stoller bottling from Chehalem shows some dark, musky flavors, with black cherry fruit wrapped around whiffs of smoke and the commonly found Oregon notes of tomato leaf and bud. Despite its immediate impact, it falls a bit light in the back end, and does not have quite enough weight to support the thick tannins.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Overt can't-miss aromas of mustard and sauerkraut would be fine if this were a hot dog, but it's not. In the mouth, this feels strained and wiry. Sour pickled flavors of cabbage and plum finish raw. This is loaded with challenges and flaws.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"This Zin is made from a combination of four of Newsome-Harlow's vineyard sources, including Locke, Big John's, Dalton and Shake Ridge Ranch, the latter three of which are all single-vineyard bottlings, and incorporates 12% Petite Sirah. It's solid, with pretty raspberry flavors and hints of spice and admirable acidity. A little sweeter and tighter than the winery's single-vineyard efforts.",US-California:Zinfandel
"All hand-harvested and hand-sorted, this is a spectacular effort—racy, sharp-edged, showing a steely, stony definition that is rare in the New World. Woodward Canyon wines need time and reward cellaring, but that is not to say that these wines cannot be savored when young. It's just that they will improve dramatically with time. Here are intimations of herb, olive, bark, pepper, tobacco and clove. It's a truly gorgeous wine, rarified and tight.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Importer Robert Kacher has an impressive stable of rosés from the southern Rhône at terrific pricing. this one, from the undervalued right bank of the valley, features 70% Cabernet Franc.

It's wall-to-wall tannins now, with complex flavors of red fruits mingling with tomato leaf, oregano, spice and tobacco (reflections of the 40% Cabernet Sauvignon that goes with more familiar Malbec). A bullish finish with mild green notes should soften with aging. Drink from 2014 to 2021.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon

"A hulking, concentrated and full-bodied wine, given plenty of time in new French oak, it has a power and intensity that's hard to decipher at first sip.

It comes from selected parcels in Rocim, and is only made in top years. Age this powerful wine and drink from 2017.",Portugal-Alentejo:Portuguese Red
"The nose is still closed on this bracing red but it eventually reveals whiffs of black plum, licorice and leather. The dense, extracted palate offers blackberry, Marasca cherry, clove, espresso, licorice and a blast of black pepper. It's still young, with brooding tannins that need time to soften.

"A minty, menthol aroma and flavors like cherry cola make this an unusual, easy-drinking and full-bodied wine.",US-California:Red Blend
"Very full-bodied and rich, a densely structured wine that's too young to appreciate now.

Now through 2012, at least.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Fresh and fruity, this simple, easy-drinking red doles out black cherry, blackberry, white pepper and clove. Racy acidity brightens the juicy fruit flavors.",Italy-Piedmont:Barbera
"Not an easy wine to appreciate now. It's tannic, and the fruit is fresh and primary, with the sweet, candied taste of a chewy raspberry twist. Still, there's something complex and interesting going on. It's not just another overripe Zin. Give it a year or two to come around.",US-California:Zinfandel

Like all Lanson wines, it is dry although this rosé also brings out crisp red currant fruits and tight acidity. It is ready to drink.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"This opens with aromas of black berry fruit along with more rustic notes of game and a whiff of barnyard.

"Terrific structure on this well made wine. You'll be impressed by the rich tannins and fine acids. Caresses the palate with gentle smoothness. But be forewarned, this wine is lean on fruit.

"Waxy peach and apple aromas come with a leesy cookie-like component. This is 50% each Sauvignon Blanc and Garnacha Blanca, and it feels both plump and watery. Flavors of quince and apple are diluted and distant, while the finish is mild.",Spain-Northern Spain:White Blend

But the tremendous heart of cherry, blackberry, chocolate and plum fruit suggests ageability.",US-California:Merlot

Spicy red-berry and tomato flavors finish with pulling tannins and a lasting herbal character.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"The 2010s are magical right now, and Norm Yost's latest reveals why. Intoxicating and sultry aromas of plums, figs and other savory fruits get a mace-powered, brown spice kick.

"This is a brilliant wine that showcases Edna Valley's ability to produce some of the purest white-wine flavors in California. If there's any oak, it's not apparent at all.

"As classy a bottle as you might expect from veteran winemaker Laurent Montalieu. Once again the fruit is crystal clear, setting up fresh pear, green apple and pink grapefruit flavors against crisp, juicy acidity. The finish is lively and spicy.",US-Oregon:Pinot Gris
"A deceptive Pinot. It shows a pale color and a very delicate, silky mouthfeel, but the impact on the palate can only be described as explosive, and the aftertaste is very rich. The flavors of cherries, cotton candy, red raspberries, orange tea, smoky vanilla, cinnamon, cloves and brown sugar are compelling. Best now and through 2010.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Dry and smoothly tannic, this wine is packed with complex blackberry-pie, currant, anise, herb and cedar flavors. This is nearly as good as the winery's more costly Walking Tree Vineyard Block Collection Cabernet, but it's just a little less concentrated.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Full-bodied wine, spiced with nutmeg and toast and give richness by sweet blackberry juice flavors. It is densely structured, rich with great fruit character as well as a powerful drive of rich tannins. Age this wine at least four years and more.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Pricey, yes, but Madrigal pulled out all the stops on this flashy wine, making it their best Cabernet ever. It's a big, tannic and dry wine, stuffed with blackberry, currant and oak flavors. Voluptuous and dramatic, but it needs age, possibly a lot. Give it a rest until 2015 and see how it's doing then.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This has a traditional medium-garnet color with brick rim. Effusive aromas that are smoky, beefy and earthy lead to distinctive wild berry, sage and cherry flavors. The texture is smooth but nicely supported by acid and tannins, and all the complexity of this wine lingers on the finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This shows the finesse of the vineyard, not to mention the winemaker's talent.

"Within an enclave of adored cool-climate vineyard sites, just under five miles from the ocean, Taylor Ridge is planted to the Swan clone of Pinot Noir.

The sweet cherry flavors and plump tannins are accented by notes of cola and brown licorice with oxidative notes providing distraction.",US-Washington:Malbec
"This beautiful wine includes 9% Cabernet Franc that gives a lift of floral violet and grainy cedar.

"Numerous sites in the Horse Heaven Hills didn't produce fruit in 2011 due a late 2010 freeze.

This fresh Rosso di Montalcino is redolent of pressed violets and rose petals and has more of a floral characteristic than it does a fruity one. The wine is thin but firm in the mouth with a lean but crisp aftertaste.,Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Though replanted, the vines designated for this bottling were taken from cuttings of the original vineyard blocks dating back to the early 1970s. Pretty in color, aroma and overall balance, this offers substantial black cherry fruit at its core, buttressed with barrel flavors of cacao. The wine shows good penetration and power, helped by aging 16 months in 38% new barrels.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Fiore is engineered to deliver fresh and easy sensations of white flower and citrus. The lean, zesty mouthfeel would work with fried calamari.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:White Blend
"Earthy aromas of leather, game, meat juices and mature black-skinned fruit lead the nose on this hefty wine. The palate offers sawdust, licorice, prune and espresso but not enough fruit richness to support the oak. Fleeting but astringent tannins leave a bitter finish.",Italy-Southern Italy:Primitivo

"Scents of pine pitch, tomato, smashed kalamata olive and wild berry combine for a clove-soaked punch experience. Spice hits the palate hard, with oregano, thyme, sagebrush and more pine, set against strong tannins as well. Lay this one down for additional development and maturity, and try after 2018.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"There's not much going on with this soft Moscato except for white sugar and vanilla bean flavors, and only hints of oranges and tropical fruits.",US-California:Moscato
"This is the inaugural release from this winery. With Grenache (71%) and Syrah (23%) leading the way, it shows aromas of vanilla bean, herb and ripe red and blue fruit.

"A rich and creamy sort of Malbec that pours on the weight, extract and oaky, coconutty character. The palate is syrupy, with huge flavors of roasted berry, molasses and sweet spices. Arguably on the baked and heavy side, but definitely a rich, huge wine with just enough core acidity to keep it balanced.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"There is no lack of luxurious, concentrated fruit flavor in this full-bodied, non-oaky wine. It tastes like ripe black cherries, feels smooth and easy for a big wine like this, and finishes with even more fruit.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"It may be that this wine needs time in the cellar, but right now, it's tough and tannic. There are some fine blackberry, cassis, spicy plum and cedar flavors, and it could blossom after 2008 for a few years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A very bright, tropical Sémillon from Amador-based Andis. Winemaker Mark McKenna uses 35-year-old vines to make this layered, slightly sweet but completely in balance wine. Enjoyable lychee, just-ripe pineapple and fig permeate; the wine gets even better as it opens.",US-California:Sémillon
"This well-aged release definitely falls on the ripe-to-the-point-of-raisins side of the fruit spectrum. It's almost Port-like, with flavors of blackberry pie and coffee. Not a dessert wine though—it's bone dry and ready to drink right now.",US-Oregon:Syrah
"The name of the wine is an old word used to measure fields, and reflects the Gallo (no connection with the California winery) family's use of traditional ideas and techniques at Vie de Romans.

"This is one of the grand wines of the Douro, from the last estate to be founded by the legendary Dona Antonia Ferreira in the 19th century.

"Made predominantly from Cabernet Franc, this includes Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Tempranillo as well.

"Calina's first attempt at a super Chilean is successful. The wine, a multiappellation blend, really pops in the mouth. The fruit is ripe and the power is there.

"Wood-aged Malbec, and yes, the wood is all there. There is some fruit, red berries and some sweetness, but the wood dominates at this stage. Give it two years. Very provisional as of now.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"In this vintage, the winery stays true to its reputation for making balanced, more restrained Cabernet, offering firm, structured tannins and bright cassis and blackberry around a deft sprinkling of dried herb.

"Seems a bit on the woody side for now, boasting aromas of dark roasted coffee backed by hints of plummy fruit.

"Côte Bonneville releases this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend quite late, so it's well into the maturing process. Pretty aromas of smoke, tea and mint accompany secondary fruit flavors.

"This is the winery's first varietal Malbec. Estate grown at the Bella Terra vineyard, it's an exciting debut, with floral scents over vivid purple fruit, and residual flavors of cured meat, smoke and pepper. About 14% Petit Verdot has been added to the blend.",US-Washington:Malbec
"This full-bodied but stealthy and deep wine looks very dark in color. It has moderate ripe fruit and spice aromas, but doesn't really show its cards until the flavors almost explode with boysenberry and blackberry jam, and nuances of wood smoke and dark chocolate hit the palate. It has great intensity, layers of flavor and a nice, lingering finish.",US-California:Primitivo
"This stylishly labeled wine by Adam Lazarre and Christian Tietje shows salted apples, lime blossoms and white flowers on the nose. The energetic palate offers just-cut green pears at first, then opens into a touch of vanilla. It tightens back down on green apple peels before ending with vanilla cream. The wine delivers a full experience.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Reduced rubbery aromas of blackberry and black currant come with a touch of mushroom. This is extracted, heavy and blocky on the palate, while baked blackberry flavors are massive but short on elegance. Bitter coffee flavors, rugged tannins and stickiness make for a heavy finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Tastes overworked and sweetly heavy, with super-extracted pineapple jam, orange tapioca and butterscotch flavors. A heavy hand has been applied here.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Floral aromas reminiscent of citrus blossom, tuberose and black locust flower lift out of the glass. The bright, straightforward palate offers Bosc pear, lemon drop and toasted hazelnut alongside soft but fresh enough acidity.",Italy-Piedmont:Arneis
"Notions of very ripe peaches lead onto a tight, fresh and zesty palate where you can still catch glimpses of that peach. A rounded and fruity number, not without precision.",Austria-Wachau:Riesling
"This is a dark, brooding and earthy Zin, that's high in alcohol, intensely oaky, and with a huge black pepper character that dives head first towards the finish into slightly pruny land.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Fruit-punchy aromas show on the seemingly sweet-leaning nose of this fun and easy wine, as do hints of pomegranate and hibiscus. The palate picks up strawberry and dried-lilac flavors. It's well made, but simple.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made from organically grown grapes, this is crisp and clean. A straight line of bright red and citrus fruits is sharpened by acidity. It has a refreshing aftertaste.",France-Provence:Rosé
"Pretty notes of black-cherry blossom and fruit are bolstered by black pepper, dried violets, deep red roses and a touch of cinnamon on the nose of this wine from the region's most famous vineyard. It presents a hearty, earthy style on the palate, with anise, bay leaf, black tea and coffee flavors that spice up the dense elderberry and strawberry fruit.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This plump, fruity expression of Merlot from southern Tuscany shows great intensity. It feels soft and velvety smooth, and it offers cherry, chocolate and lightly toasted almond notes on the finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Merlot
"Very herbal and green, this is an intensely grassy wine, with a catty character. It's crisp, fresh and ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"This opens with whiffs of yellow apple, pineapple and white spring flowers. The palate delivers tropical fruit and white peach alongside crackling acidity and persistent, vigorous bubbles.",Italy-Veneto:Glera
"Most of this wine comes from esteemed Evergreen Vineyard in the Ancient Lakes appellation. It charms with aromas of green apple, Bosc pear and mineral. The flavors are medium bodied and pure, with a lightly creamy feel and a zing of acidity stitching it all together. The balance is spot-on.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"A bit restrained on the nose, still young, this wine expresses raspberry and strawberry notes curled around a soft, medium-bodied core. Subtle in oak, it builds aroma and flavor in the glass, suggesting that it's worth the time to open before enjoying.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Raspberry, plum and currant aromas are darkened by a mild note of asphalt. This feels round but also fresh and lively. Flavors of plum and spiced currant finish dry and focused.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Carmenère
"Saucy aromas of stewed plum and tomato ragu lack clarity. This is midlevel Cabernet, with a light bounce to its step. Generic cherry, cassis and licorice flavors finish with acidic kick but no sense of refinement.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon
"With a burnished gold tint, this oak-aged, mature Godello offers dry citrus aromas, hard spice and barrel notes. The palate is structured and holding its own, while oaky, oxidized flavors of orange and peach end with almond, wood resin and mature citrus flavors. Drink this interesting but unusual white now.",Spain-Northern Spain:Godello
"A vitamin pill scent greets you immediately, somewhat masking the fruit. In the mouth it's rather light, watery and showing green apple fruit with plenty of acid. The finish softens up but doesn't add any depth or flavor.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"There's potential for this brooding, boisterous varietal on the Central Coast. In this bottling from Bella Collina Vineyard, the nose offers black plum, cola and big, fat berries ready to pop. The palate is smooth and held together by silky tannins, showing flavors of plum fruit, cooked cherries and a peppery spice that tingles the tongue from the midpalate onward.",US-California:Tannat
"This is a concentrated wine that's full of black fruits and textured tannins. It has spice, rosemary and a taut character.",France-Provence:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Firm and closed this is a dark and tannic wine, although black currant flavors are also very present. It feels austere with a mineral texture and concentrated final acidity. Drink Lafite's second wine from 2017.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This has sharp, cedary oak dominating the fruit right now. The fruit is good, solid black cherry, but it is not quite big enough to tackle all that new oak, though some bottle time will help. Good, ambitious winemaking. —P.G.",US-Washington:Merlot
"No one does a better job with the Syrah from this vineyard than Mark Ryan McNeilly. Here, the peppery, just-ripe fruit is washed in a caramel bath. The flavors are long, and despite all of the barrel influence, the grapes have the muscle and texture to stand out equally.",US-Washington:Syrah
"This everyday Chardonnay will appeal to fans of the modern style of ripe fruit and plenty of oak. It's rich and creamy, with pineapple, tangerine and mango flavors.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This is a simple, country-style Pinot Noir, dry and modest in berry fruit. It's not bad, just not particularly interesting. But for the price, it will get you through.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Tiny amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot were added to this succulent, elegant wine with cassis, cranberry and black cherry flavors and rounded structure. A light note of cocoa dust and soft texture balance its exotically spiced lushness with delicious integration.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A majority of Cabernet Sauvignon drives this blend, with 34% Sangiovese and 12% Petite Sirah providing spice and substance. Black leather, chocolate and a distinct taste of baked strawberry provide flavor atop soft, full-bodied layers of high-octane intensity.",US-California:Cabernet Blend
"Rich and rounded in character, this is already a beautiful wine, from 80-year-old vines. A line of acidity shoots through the wine, giving a long lift to the green fruits and orange zest flavors. It does have weight and a generous texture that reveals itself slowly. Ripe apricots mingle with acidity and toast at the end. Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This lightly sparkling, terroir-driven wine is loaded with soul and finesse. It's ethereal and bone dry, with delicately alluring aromas and flavors of white spring flower, ripe apple, Bartlett pear, citrus and Alpine herb. Crisp acidity and a silky mousse provide balance and finesse while a mineral note energizes the focused finish. The sediment at the bottom of the bottle adds even more flavor to the last glass.",Italy-Veneto:Glera
The wine is perfumed and so soft. It could make a good apéritif with its light texture and equally light acidity. Drink now.,Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese White
"Packed with the dark tannins and structure of Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine, produced by the team of Calon Ségur is intense, concentrated and dark. It has a firm structure, solid and with a luscious aftertaste. The acidity of the year just shows at the end. Drink from 2026.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A lush fruit nose, with plenty of blackberry jam, woodsmoke and anise. Quite chunky on the palate, but amaiable and easy going, although not a particularly long finish. A pleasant food friendly wine for a weekday night after a hard day at work.",Italy-Piedmont:Dolcetto
"Quite approachable for such a heady blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 3% Malbec, this wine shows blueberry, black cherry, turned loam and toasted sage on the dense nose. Though driven by ripe purple fruit and purple flower flavors, the palate is lightly spiced with cedar, juniper, tobacco and turned earth.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Tasting strongly of spicy wood, this wine is firm, with a tight, granitic texture. Tannins and acidity anchor its blackberry fruit, yielding a structured wine that is ready to drink.",Portugal-Dão:Touriga Nacional

"Full and ripe, this wine offers thick meaty flavors of pineapple and peach, finishing in sweet vanilla oak.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This muted, tannic Cabernet spent 20 months in new French oak. The dark black cherry and berry fruit are overwhelmed somewhat by the toast and oak.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"There are masses of pineapple, apricot, orange and green apple fruit in this Chardonnay, accented with strong Carneros acidity. Quite a good wine, but once you get past the flavors, it falls off in interest. Could be a rare Chardonnay sleeper. Try giving it 2–3 years in the cellar.",US-California:Chardonnay
This wine has benefited from the warm vintage. It's ripe with attractive cherry fruit and a touch of spice from wood aging. It will be ready to drink from 2018.,France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Quite good and above the masses when compared to the bulk of rosé wines coming from Argentina. Made from Malbec, it's bright and floral, with a touch of citrus to the nose. Healthy, vibrant, balanced and cleansing, with flavors of berries, nectarine and pink grapefruit. Drink now.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Rosé
Dainty strokes of crisp-tart raspberry and watermelon rind accent this finely textured rosé. It's a brisk delicately concentrated wine with a brambly lingering finish. Drink now.,US-New York:Rosé
"A pure Sauvignon Blanc, unusual in Pessac-Léognan, which normally also includes Sémillon. This is a purely fresh wine, but with a serious aging potential side to it. For now, the white fruits, currants and pears are delicious, with fresh structure and a touch of wood spice. Screwcap.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Wy'east is better than ever in this vintage, a divine balancing act with berry, plum, Asian spices and chocolate all in focus. From the opening scents, laden with complex and perfectly fused notes of blackberry, mineral, coriander and cacao, right on through the extended, captivating finish, this is a wine that is almost impossible to put down, yet will drink well at least through 2025.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This is an aromatically brooding wine with notes of herbs, pepper and brown spices. It drinks quite sweet with a lightly chalky feel.",US-Washington:Syrah
"There are some overripened notes in this Zin that lift the blackberries into raisins. There's also some heat, making the wine taste higher in alcohol than it is. Drink this strong, heady Zin with barbecue.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This murky Malbec has odd, horsey, berry aromas. It's rough and raw on the palate, with leafy, herbal plum flavors that finish rugged and with a dull spiciness.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Dusty tannins show the ripeness of the fruit in this wine. With its black-currant fruits and acidity, it is balanced and almost ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"92-94 Dark, dry wine initially with austerity. Then the bright berry fruits come from behind the severe façade to give a structured, still luscious wine.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"From one of the oldest estates in Montalcino, this pretty Brunello opens with inky dark fruit and plump cherry backed by touches of leather and spice. But like many of the wines from the 2008 vintage, it shows austere and sharp acidity as well.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"A blend of Sangiovese, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this shows sun-ripened fruit aromas of cherry, prune, blackberry and plum. Spicy toasted notes appear on the finish, giving the wine richness and softness.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend

"This textured wine is tight with layers of nervy acidity. It is crisp, with good amounts of acidity and flavors of red currants that add extra freshness.",France-Provence:Rosé

"Maturing well, this ripe red-berry flavored wine is soft and rounded. It has just a hint of tannins and wood along with generous ripe fruitiness. The wine is full bodied, likely to be ready to drink from 2018.",France-Loire Valley:Pinot Noir
"A structured and still young wine from the estate owned by the Tari family, formerly of Château Giscours in Margaux. It is packed with black fruits, spice and dense tannins that are melding together so well. Licorice and wood aging give the wine an extra complex dimension. Drink this from 2019.",France-Provence:Provence red blend
"Roughly half and half Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, the Longevity bottling brings spice and tangy red fruits into focus. The forward, mouth-filling flavors suggest strawberry preserves and pie cherries. It's drinking nicely; no need to wait.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The Pio Cesare is dominated by the smell of diesel. Beyond that are a few shards of fruit, but overall this is a throwback for those who like the tarriness that characterized old-fashioned Barolos.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"There is no indication on the bottle what this blend might be. Regardless of composition, it's a generic, solid wine with melon and vanilla cookie aromas backed by a round, citrusy mouthfeel. Flavors of briny citrus and white grapefruit finish decently.",Spain-Central Spain:White Blend
"This opens with fragrant aromas of yellow rose, apricot, butterscotch and spicy vanilla. It has edium density, with a fresh mouthfeel lending this a unique personality.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Grigio

"This opens with pretty aromas suggesting white spring flower, citrus and white stone fruit. The bright palate offers nectarine, chopped herb and pear alongside refreshing acidity.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Catarratto
"Apparently this is the current release. The winery aims at a Right Bank, Bordeaux-style profile. At this advanced age the wine is showing some bricking at the edges, with mature drying fruit and a big dose of barrel. Smoky, oaky and toasty, it's a wine to drink up, perhaps with a big steak dinner.",US-Oregon:Merlot
"A very rich, flamboyant style of Chardonnay, showing caramelized oak, vanilla, buttered toast and plenty of ripe pineapple, sweet lime and honey richness. But it's balanced with crisp acidity. Drink now.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Coming from one of the few vineyards between the coastal town of Cambria and Paso Robles, this brooding wine offers dark and dank aromas of black dirt, slate, charred meat and very black cherry. Once sipped, sagebrush and lavender herbals emerge, along with sour cherry. A promising effort for an area that may be its own appellation one day.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Whiffs of crushed mineral and candle wax lend mineral intensity to crisp, concentrated green plum and honeydew flavors in this semi-dry Riesling. Lime acidity cuts through the midpalate, leading into a long, slightly floral finish. Year after year, it's an exceptional bargain wine of consistent value.",US-New York:Riesling

"Boisterous fruit shows on the nose of this wine from the heart of the newish appellation, presented in a specially made Ballard Canyon bottle. Olallieberry jam gains nuance from pulverized purple flowers. The palate begins with straightforward purple fruits then evolves into potpourri, incense and dried berries.",US-California:Syrah
"Fresh, crisp white peach and apple aromas are bright and breezy on this refreshing unoaked Chardonnay. It's not robustly concentrated, but zesty acidity keeps it quaffable and brisk.",US-New York:Chardonnay

"Some creamy yeasty tones are supported by background notes of banana and apricot and give this Soave Classico a rich, generous mouthfeel. Pair this wine with pasta, eggplant sauce and mozzarella.",Italy-Veneto:Garganega
Smashed black rocks and turned earth meet with black plum and pasilla chile on the nose of this bottling. The palate is relatively thin in body but full of blueberry and pepper-spice flavors.,US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a strongly flavored blush, packing a punch of raspberry, fig, sweet tea and rose flavors. It's dry and very crisp in acidity. Give it a chill and enjoy with salted, smoked meats, or a nice fish stew.",US-California:Rosé
"This is a spicy wine with mint aromas and rich juicy fruits. It is dense, powerful and concentrated while preserving a sense of proportion and style. Dark wood-aging flavors are still showing and need time to integrate. Drink from 2018.",France-Provence:Provence red blend
"This wine begins with aromas that recall red peppers, black berries and spice with a whiff of grilled sage. The palate offers ripe black cherry and plum accented with white pepper and cinnamon-spice and thyme. It still has youthful, aggressive tannins that need a few more years to soften. Drink 2016–2021.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Raisin and fig aromas are good but not overly complex or special. This P. X. feels rich, chewy and a touch sticky, with sweet-as-sin fig, chocolate and cinnamon spice flavors that suggest coffee cake with a drizzle of melted fudge.",Spain-Andalucia:Pedro Ximénez

"Blocky and brambly on the nose, with a fair amount of funk. The palate is crisp, semitart and lean-bodied, and with tight acidity it's a little scouring. Lots of red-fruit character but not a lot of mouthfeel.",Spain-Northern Spain:Red Blend
This is a sweet and soft rosé. It has perfumed red-berry fruits that are given a lift by the acidity. The finish is fresh while sweet.,Portugal-Vinho Verde:Rosé
"This cuvée is a barrel selection, fermented with whole berries and aged in 35% new oak. Simple strawberry and raspberry fruit seems almost weightless, and the quick finish carries a strong streak of bouillon.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This smells smoky, meaty and slightly earthy—in an attractive way—and tastes almost as savory as it is fruity. Flavors resemble ripe plums with added cardamom, cinnamon and dried fennel. The texture is ultrasmooth and it seems to melt in the mouth, leaving a soft impression on the finish.",US-California:Tempranillo
"Strongly woody at this stage, this wine does have the potential to reveal ripe fruits and a generous structure. Smoky flavors are beginning to balance with broad red fruits and acidity. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Tarry aromas of elderberry, teriyaki beef, soy and purple flowers combine for an umami-driven nose on this bottling from a newer vineyard in the region, with winemaking by Matt Dees. The palate packs vibrantly tart plum juice and dried lavender flavors, held up by powerful acidity, impressive for young vines.",US-California:Syrah
"Fresh sage and tarragon notes lend a lovely green, herbal tone to this just off-dry wine. The palate is refreshing with lemony acidity and straightforward apple and pear flavors.",Germany-Rheingau:Riesling
"From a selection of parcels, this is a ripe and fruity wine. Vines aged on average 55 years have produced a ripe concentrated wine with opulent yellow fruits that are balanced by citrus acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Very sweet at first, with aromas of cherry cough drop and crème de cassis. Turns cheesy with air, and once the palate arrives be prepared for tangy pie cherry flavors in front of a starchy, lean finish. Offers the basics but nothing more.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Intensely aromatic with notes of flowers and ripe tropical fruits, this is a lush, textured Gewurztraminer with massive power and brawn. Just off dry in style, it's surprisingly elegant for such a big-bodied wine, but with ample acidity. Nuances of tea leaves and potpourri linger on the finish.",US-New York:Gewürztraminer
"Made in a lighter, more accessible and candied style, this Pinot has pleasant cherry, raspberry, cinnamon sugar and sandalwood flavors. Easy to find, with 5,000 cases produced.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A lovely wine, rich and balanced and crisp, that shows how sometimes an offbeat blend can be better than a varietal wine. Made from Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer and Viognier, it's deliciously off-dry. Each variety brings something to the table, resulting in a whole that's superior to its parts.",US-California:White Blend
"The blend of these four Rhône white grapes—47% Grenache Blanc, 32% Marsanne, 16% Roussanne, 5% Picpoul—outshines their individual bottlings. Some sort of magic accrues.

It's got a peaches-and-cream mouthfeel, and a lick of butterscotch in the lush finish.",US-Washington:Rhône-style White Blend

"Its prime location near Archery Summit and Domaine Drouhin marks Nysa as one of Oregon's most sought-after fruit sources. Mark McNeilly (of Mark Ryan Winery) has chosen it for one of two vineyard designates for this new project. Sweet baking spices and raspberry jam are the hallmarks here, offering immediate appeal, while retaining the structure to age for another decade. Aim for an optimal drinking window from 2019 through 2024.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Not quite ripe, with green, vegetal notes suggesting asparagus. This was a cool vintage, and the wine is from a cool area.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is a dry Prosecco, meaning it is slightly sweeter than a brut or extra dry. Traditionally, Prosecco has this level of sugar, making it a very true rendition of what the wine is intended to taste like: Fresh peach, basil, pineapple, yellow apple and even an understated touch of banana come into play.",Italy-Veneto:Prosecco
"Black plum, licorice and cool green-herb aromas rest in front of a full-bodied, tannic, chunky palate. Flavors of herbal black fruits come with a salty edge and a meaty underbelly. A long, rolling, deep finish is encouraging and stout. Best from 2018–2024.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"Though the wine saw less than 10% new oak, it carries a rich, smoky note of espresso from first whiff to last swallow. It's dusty and dense, with fragrances of baking spice and incense. The flavors bring accents of citrus rind, orange peel and white pepper, showing lovely balance and varietal strength throughout.",US-Washington:Syrah
"A terrific red wine. Stood out in a blind tasting among expensive Napa Valley Bordeaux-style reds. The grapes are from the winery's high-elevation ranch in Potter Valley. The wine shows firm tannins and a brisk backbone of acidity, with the cherry, red plum and currant flavors grounded with fresh herbs, mushrooms, grilled meat and a smack of tamari that suggests Chinese mushu pork. Really a dramatic wine that should hold over the next four years.",US-California:Merlot
"Petit Chablis comes from the plateau above the main Chablis vineyards. As here, it offers a light fruity style with only the lightest minerality and much more in the way of apple and citrus flavors. Drink the wine from early 2017.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This blend of Montepulciano and Aglianico offers deep notes of resin, spice, plum, black fruit, cherry and root beer. The wine has a slightly raw quality with nervous tannins that are characteristic of both grape varieties but many years in the bottle have softened them.",Italy-Southern Italy:Red Blend

Drink from 2017.",France-France Other:Red Blend

"There's a touch of Band-Aid or used leather that falls to the background the more the wine spends time in the glass. Cherry and white almond are the leading aromatic accents and this blend of Sangiovese (80%), Merlot and Cabernet is simple and fresh in the mouth.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
Hafner has been a pioneer of Austrian ice wine. Not every one in their considerable range of ice wines work. This one does. It has just that right piercing acidity to give a heart-stopping lift to the sweetness of the wine. The sweet pineapple and peach flavors add extra richness.,Austria-Burgenland:Chardonnay
"This is as crisp and dry as a whispy reed, with a mild grassy note on the nose. It feels fresh and focused, with lime, peach and apple flavors. Fruity, fresh and easy to like from start to finish, this is what a Best Buy should be.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
It's the smoky flavors and acidity that dominate this fresh wine. It has hints of black-currant flavors that may develop although the wine is light and shows more dry tannins than fruit at this stage. Think about waiting until 2018.,France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a very big, rich, dense Pinot Noir, and some will fault it for having the high alcohol and full body that are characteristic of Cabernet. Nonetheless, this is immensely complex and dramatic, offering wave after wave of concentrated black cherry and red currant, with notes of bacon and sweet oak. Gets better and more attractive as it warms in the glass. Drink now–2016.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A blend of Cabernet Franc (80%) and Petit Verdot, this is a perfumed wine with high-toned aromas of violets, herbs, baking spices, pencil eraser, barrel notes and plum. The flavors are broad in feel, with bright acidity that stitches it all together nicely.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

The aromas are strongly varietal, with a mix of fresh herbs and sharp tannins. The fruit is subtle, black cherry and cassis, threaded with smoke.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"At this stage, the wine seems to have too much wood. Hopefully this will dissipate because round yellow fruits are all there, along with fresh, crisp acidity. It is a wine with potential and will be better from 2017.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This Napa-side-of-Carneros Chardonnay is resplendent in crisp yet hearty aromas of apple, pear and flowery jasmine.

It shows best with food, preferably spicy.",US-California:Gewürztraminer
"Situated next door to the Grand Cru vineyards, this vineyard produces some grand wines. This wine comes from the Olivier Leflaive domaine.

"The nose is rather shy but eventually reveals subdued aromas of underbrush, toast and a whiff of dried menthol. The rather lean palate isn't very expressive, offering raw cherry, cranberry and a hint of powered sage alongside astringent but fleeting tannins that dry out the finish.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Red Blend
"This Bordeaux-style blend is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Franc. It's on the rough and rustic side, showing ample stem and herbal flavors. Tannins are stiff and carry the impression that they did not achieve optimal ripeness.",US-Oregon:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"At first this lively, fairly full-bodied Rioja smells rubbery and earthy, with baked plum and raspberry aromas, but it eventually opens and smells more elegant and classy. Wild berry, plum and oak spice are the key flavors, followed by pepper and resiny wood notes on a fresh, racy finish. Drink through 2022.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Pieluni Riserva is a superdense and rich expression of Montepulciano that could use another 3–5 years of aging. Oak spice aromas (the wine aged in French barrique for 18 months) are evident and will relax with time, ulimately revealing black fruit, cassis and sweet cinnamon spice.",Italy-Central Italy:Montepulciano
"A strong followup to the excellent 2005, Amisfield's 2006 Pinot Noir seems riper and weightier, marrying dark black cherry and plum fruit with hints of chocolate and spice cake. Finishes with soft tannins and a slightly dusty feel. Drink now–2015.",New Zealand-Central Otago:Pinot Noir
"Juicy, appetizing apple notes rise from the glass, helped along by summer blossom and rose. The off-dry palate is generous with ripe peach and plum accented by pleasantly bitter notes of pith. The tiniest amount of spritz helps to keep things fresh.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"This blend of 70% Nero d'Avola and 30% Syrah opens with aromas of blackberry and blue flower. The lean palate is drying out, but still offers a black cherry note and astringent wood tannins that give it an abrupt, drying finish.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Red Blend

"All varietal, aromas of crushed rock, black licorice, barrel spice, green pepper, pink peppercorns and savory herbs lead to a well-balanced palate backed by firm, lightly grainy tannins. It needs time still to fully come together but has more than enough stuffing to go the distance.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is one of the first wines to bear this new appellation in Sonoma County. More importantly, it's one of the best California Malbecs out there. It's rich and juicy with ripe cherries and mocha, along with a sweet coating of toasty oak. It's soft enough to drink now, especially with a great grilled steak.",US-California:Malbec
"This blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Syrah is fairly weak on the nose, with black cherry, dark spice and crushed rocks emerging with steady swirling. Purple fruits and graphite minerality show up on the palate, but this wine still needs time to come out of its shell.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah

"This wine is slightly spritzy and sugary, with simple yet clean apple flavors. The finish is sweet, quick and pleasantly quaffable. Best to chill it down before drinking.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"Aromas of red berry, rose petal, blue flower, crushed herb and a whiff of espresso lift out of the glass along with a menthol note. The taut vibrant palate offers crushed strawberry, tart cherry, white pepper and star anise alongside tightly knit fine-grained tannins.

"This opens with enticing scents of woodland berry, iris, wild rose and a balsamic note.

Drink after 2019.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo

"The pear, apple, toast and cinnamon aromas are light and elusive. The flavors are elegant, with the concentration trailing toward the finish.",US-Washington:Chardonnay

"A concentrated core of pure, sweet raspberry and cherry fruit is showcased in a wine of remarkable penetration and length. The fruit, from a biodynamic estate vineyard, is perfumed and open, making this immediately accessible and supremely enjoyable. And yet cellaring will surely reward those with the patience and discipline to lay it down for up to a decade.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Superbly warm weather in 2015 gave an extra boost of sunshine to many of the Mosel's entry-level wines, and the RK is one of the best. Whiffs of freesia and tangerine peel waft from the glasss of this semidry Riesling. It's low in alcohol, yet so honeyed and ripe that flavors of grapefruit and peach seem to slick sumptuously on the palate. Zesty lime acidity freshens a lingering finish.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"Soft, open wine, with some attractive perfumed character as well as light acidity. It is somewhat unfocused, missing structure. Screwcap.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This wine is big, very full bodied and very lush in texture. Super-ripe in flavor, it rides at the place where plum notes segue to prune, and black cherry to cherry syrup, which is a very tasty place to be. Plenty of fine tannins frame all that concentration, yet the mouthfeel stays soft.",US-California:Barbera
"This blends grapes from four separate vineyards, matured in older barrels. It's best enjoyed young, with the freshness that brings to the sharp-edged, brambly berry fruit. A whiff of pine resin and ample herbal accents add further complexity.",Canada-British Columbia:Pinot Noir
"Scott Sisemore's small Belmont-based label pushes the lower-alcohol movement into the realm of Syrah, in this case producing a wine whose aromas are more like one of the appellation's Cabs, with juniper, pine, oregano, green and black olives and dried plums. Elderberries and those same herbal characters show on the palate, which some will love and others will find unfamiliar.",US-California:Syrah
"Named after the Laroche winery, L'Obédiencerie, this wine is a selection from the Blanchots Grand Cru vineyard. It is rich, but endowed with a taut minerality that cuts through the ripe green plum and crisp pear flavors. It demands aging. Drink from 2020.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay

"This shows the extraordinary richness and complexity that the winery's estate vineyard has exhibited over its lifetime. It's vast in cherry, red currant and licorice flavors, plus multiple layers of sautéed mushroom, exotic baking spice, mineral and sweet, smoky sandalwood. It's also very tannic, with a brisk spine of acidity. Good as it is, it needs time for all the parts to knit together. Better after 2018.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Longtime value producer Firesteed has another winner. This pretty Pinot shows excellent ripeness and full-bodied fruit flavor, thanks to the southern-Oregon components. Strawberries and tart raspberries come through cleanly, with a touch of cola in the aftertaste.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Dark in color, this soft, leathery Zin offers tangents of blackberry, chocolate and espresso within a heavy-handed package of serious fruit and weight.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This is mustardy smelling, with salad-like aromas. It feels round, plump and a little heavy, with spiced apple and mild citrus flavors. Chunky in feel and briny in taste on the finish. Not as good as past vintages.",Spain-Northern Spain:Verdejo
"Boasts fascinating aromas of caramel, soy sauce and meats, with only a small dash of strawberries. This is an assertively flavored Champagne that would shine with game or red meats; it’s not a great sipper on its own.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Sweet with brown-sugar aromas, but the nose lacks more than that. Citrus and other sweet aromas are solid but common, while the feel is good and the finish brings back brown sugar and mocha. Standard; not designed for complexity.",Spain-Andalucia:Sherry
"Freixenet's signature Cava is consistent and pure as usual, with aromas of white fruit and white pepper and an overall freshness on the nose. It feels crisp and focused, with a foamy palate that brings apple, lime, peach and spice flavors. The finish is smooth.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"This is a fresh, strawberry-flavored wine with a crisp, dry aftertaste. An attractive tangy character gives life and brilliance. Ready to drink, it is a real apéritif wine.",France-Provence:Rosé
"A tremendous wine, satisfying in youth, but this should also age for a while. Made with just 2% Merlot, it's impressive in young Cabernet blackberry and cassis flavors, liberally oaked and sweetly pure in the finish. The tannins are so soft, yet so refined. Should develop through the decade, but if you drink it now, give it a good decant.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

"A stunning and unusual white wine out of Lodi made by Jim Moore, with tremendous aromatics of honeysuckle and melon and a genius balancing between sweetness and acidity. Grapes—technically Moscato Giallo—were harvested from the Bella Vigna Vineyard fully ripe but at low brix, allowing this bottling to maintain a very low 12% alcohol level. An amazing deal for a wine that jumps out of the glass, all bright and starry eyed.",US-California:Moscato

"Made by Robert Pepi, this wine reveals an elegance of dried herb and forest floor, while dry, generous tannins pack a punch. Blackberry and mocha lurk in the background, unable to overcome the wine's greener aspects.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lots of fruit power flows through this full-bodied wine, making it focused and delicious. A firm coating of tannin kicks in to add weight to the texture and help the flavors linger on the finish.

The palate offers subtle structure and ample acidity to carry the ripe fruit tones, with a subtle peppery spice that dances on the finish.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon:Rosé
"Pretty dark and full-bodied for a rosé, and too extracted and heavy in cherry-berry flavors to be considered elegant. It's almost a red wine you could drink at room temperature.",US-California:Rosé
"This wine manages to combine firm structure with the finely perfumed fruit associated with Chambolle-Musigny. It's rich, fruity, lifted by acidity and held together by solid tannins. Impressive and full bodied, it's a wine to age. Drink from 2024.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"This is a light-bodied, simple wine, marked by brisk acidity and sour cherry candy flavors. Drink up.",US-California:Sangiovese
"Still young and tight, this roughly equal mix of Merlot and Cabernet Franc is showing beautiful complexity in the nose.

Green tea, black olive, fresh herb, pepper, some light chocolate and tart fruits. Good length.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"This rich, rounded wine shows ripe yellow fruits, pineapple flavors and a texture that just hints at minerality.

At the same time, the wine has weight, depth of flavor and a background structure that will allow it to age. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Made in a full-bodied style, this estate wine is generous in blackberry, black licorice and dark cherry, with classic cola spice dancing around its edges.

"Aromas of currant, plum, herbs and dry brush are fresh, focused and don't try too hard. Wiry and juicy on the palate but not all that deep, this blend of 40% Cabernet and 60% Mencía tastes of pointed plum and raspberry, flavors that turn a touch sour on a zesty, acidic finish.",Spain-Northern Spain:Red Blend
"Opens aromatically exhibiting lemon cheesecake, then delves into the rightful amount of apple and pear, finishing with a hearty helping of vanilla and caramel. Del Arroyo remains a source to watch in Livermore, especially for Chardonnay.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Dark red in color, there's an intense—for lack of a better word—grapy quality to this rustic wine. Kirsch and orange highlight the experience, before a faint structure falls short on the finish.",US-California:Syrah
"A creamy dollop of oaky, vanilla and cinnamon-scented richness bolsters the black cherry fruit of Zweigelt. The palate shows that there is ample, generous and vibrant fruit which has a real seam of vivid freshness at its core. Black cherry and blueberry notes flit across the smooth, rounded but medium-bodied palate and leave you wanting more.",Austria-Carnuntum:Zweigelt

"Three elements, already in balance, contribute to the success of this wine. First, the rich fruit, juicy blackberry and mulberry, lifted by acidity. Second, the new wood, which spices the fruit but is already smoothing out the third element, the dark firm tannic layer.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
The 45% Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine gives it structure and aging potential. It is a ripe wine that is also stylish with attractive acidity and plenty of black-currant fruitiness. The wine is developing well and it should be ready to drink from 2018.,France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The closest thing in California you can get to a great French Chablis, this is absolutely dry, high in acidity and streamlined. It offers tantalizing citrus rind and peach fruit flavors, with a savory taste of cold minerals. Fans of rich, buttery Chardonnay will find it lean, but if you have a cellar, age it for six years and see how it evolves.",US-California:Chardonnay

"This is oakier and more expensive than prior Trapiche Chardonnays, but it's not necessarily better. It smells like a rubber band and a barrel, bearing resiny flavors of mango and melon, with lots of sweet oak and vanilla tones.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Chardonnay
"This is the producer's highest and most westerly vineyard site. It holds back from the start, still tightly wound and somewhat reduced on the nose. As it opens, ethereal layers of wild strawberry, green tea and lacings of herb and white pepper unveil to tremendous effect.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Aromas of mature black-skinned berry, tobacco and dark spice lead the way.

"Smells and tastes overripe, with raisin and prune flavors. Not up to this winery's usual standards.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Red and yellow apples are the fruity markers of this crémant—their fruity flavor pervades the light-footed palate that fizzes with gentle froth. There is a bitter edge on the palate but also some autolytic, yeasty backbone, lending a bit more substance. Have this full-fruited yet light-bodied sparkler with food and it will come into its own.",France-Alsace:Sparkling Blend

"Juicy peach and aromatic orange make for an appetizing fruit-driven opening. The palate adds an element of pure zestiness and bright freshness to these exuberant, ripe and enticing fruit notes.

Drink 2017–2025.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"Sourced from the Martinelli family's Charles Vineyard out on the coast, this is a gorgeously rich and balanced white wine, whole-cluster fermented and given just less than a quarter of new French oak. Pretty, floral aromas of orange blossom pique the nose before a compelling combination of salty pretzel, ginger and lemon custard layer over a mountain of structured acidity.",US-California:Chardonnay

"This light, fresh Chardonnay has lively pear and apple flavors. A crisp texture gives zing to the brightly fruity wine. Drink now.",France-Beaujolais:Chardonnay
"Aged in 100% once-filled barrels, this smooth and savory wine blends four different Dijon clones. The spicy raspberry and cherry fruit coats the tongue, wrapped in light caramel and toast. It's a very pretty, elegant wine, drinking nicely already, but one that should continue to hold together well through 2020.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This wine is made from a field blend that includes 2% Viognier, the vines planted in 1991. Co-fermented, it offers a soft texture accented in vanilla bean, leather and dusty blackberry. Intense, it's balanced and not overripe, a nice take on the variety that flirts with tastes of orange and white pepper.",US-California:Syrah
"Aromas of orange peel, blue fruit, flowers and dried herbs are appealing and direct. The flavors and feel are elegant, showing freshness and acidity.",US-Washington:Syrah

"Pretty milk chocolate wraps around fresh strawberry fruit in this estate-grown, single-vineyard selection. A gentle wine, it turns almost soft in the middle, finishing with delicate flavors of rose water.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Gaseous and scrambled at first, with leathery aromas that mask the fruit component. Better later on, although it remains sulfuric and leathery, with confused cherry and raspberry flavors. Not much grace or precision, but not an overtly poor wine either.",Argentina-Other:Malbec
"A rich, creamy wine, loaded with personality. Spicy, oaky aromas ride over tropical fruit and peach scents, and it drinks crisp and spicy, although the midpalate is a little thin in fruit. The oaky sweetness is very nice, and so is the whistle-clean finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"The nose is lifted with bright spice and suggestions of pungent herbs. Black fruits carry a touch of mocha and lead into a crisp, moderately tannic finish. Balance and length are excellent.",US-Washington:Sangiovese
"Smelling this wine is like entering a spice box: Saffron, cumin, cardamom and cinnamon all put in minute appearances.

It's a thickly extracted wine with tight tannins: Drink after 2010.",Italy-Tuscany:Merlot

"This opens with scratchy, slightly dirty aromas of blueberry and blackberry. The palate is heavy and jammy, but also somewhat raw and abrasive. Cherry and plum flavors are basic, while an inoffensive finish falls off quickly.",Spain-Catalonia:Red Blend

Drink now–2018.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Pinot Noir
"This Bayle-Carreau wine, one of five fifth-generation family estates, is balanced between the dry core of tannins and the ripe black fruit. With acidity and a fine structure, it has great potential. As it develops the wine will show richness as well as concentration. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"An alluring fragrance of rose, aromatic herb, dark berry and a whiff of new leather take shape in the glass. The firm palate delivers ripe, dark berry, grilled sage, mint and sweet pipe tobacco alongside austere tannins that need time to come around. It's well balanced, with a licorice finish. Drink after 2018.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Briny apple aromas are crisp and focused, with side notes of pickle juice and matchstick.

This certified organic bottling dwells at the high end of the Cava spectrum.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"ound, lush and a bit warm, this is a velvety-textured Merlot with fruit characters that border on dried black cherry and plum rather than fresh fruit. Mocha and tobacco notes chime in, adding welcome complexity. Drink now–2012.",US-California:Merlot
"A bulky wine with an ample mix of cherry and chocolate flavors, this Gigondas is a big, fairly rich mouthful but is slightly lacking for nuance. Give it another year or two to see if more develops.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"From vineyards in both Alexander Valley and Bennett Valley, the grapes were fermented in French oak for eight months, a minority of it new.

"Barolo La Rosa delivers bold, dark concentration with sweet spice tones of almond paste and vanilla cream backed by sharply focused aromas of red berry, cassis, plum and mocha. In the mouth, this beautiful Nebbiolo boasts a linear but long-lasting feel.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Lifted green pears, ripe lemon rind and yellow plums make for a fruity trio. The supple palate radiates substance and style.",Austria-Niederösterreich:Grüner Veltliner
"In this new vintage there is a bit more Sauvignon Blanc (69%) than usual; the rest is Sémillon. Rich, oaky and expansive, it is an oak and texture-driven style, with the fruit—clean, slightly herbaceous, spicy and tart—playing second fiddle. Which is no criticism, because the delicious, over-the-top flavors, with layer upon layer of creamy complexity, and the rich, buttery finish just beg for lobster in a cream or butter sauce. Who can argue with that? Editors' Choice.",US-Washington:White Blend
This lightly fruity wine hints at strawberry fruits laced with soft acidity. There is a bitterness in the background that is not pleasant.,France-France Other:Sparkling Blend

"Fiore di Campo is a blended white wine from northeast Italy and as its Italian name suggests, there are indeed many aromas here that recall fresh field flowers. Distant accents of dried hay, crushed mineral and citrus fill out the background.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:White Blend
"This deliciously crisp estate-produced wine is full of the freshest strawberry fruits. It dances with its acidity and light touch of spice. From one of the largest private vineyards in France (2,300 acres), the wine is ready to drink.",France-Southwest France:Rosé

"Too heavy for a rosé, with black cherry, cola and leather flavors that lack the delicacy and zest you want in a blush wine.",US-California:Sangiovese
"A really wonderful Cabernet, clearly grown well and well made. It has that plush, rich feeling you want in a Cabernet Sauvignon, with deliciously ripe blackberry, black currant, cassis and dark chocolate flavors. Terrific now, and should age for 4–6 years, if not longer.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A fresh, lightweight wine with good black berry fruits, a juicy character and balancing spice. The tannins are certainly dry, but the fruit is well in balance.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"A heavy bottle holds a wine that's dark gold in color and exuberant in lemon curd and vanilla. Surprisingly light on the palate, given the color, it has a relatively low oak presence and layered, caramel-apple finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Unusual aromas of blue fruits are matched against cardamom and cumin scents. The palate is blocky yet dominated by acidity, while flavors of plum, black currant and woodspice are exotic. A hard finish shows hickory and barrel flavors along with wiry acidity.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Rounded and soft, this is a wine that is still developing. It exhibits ripe, powerful fruit flavors, but with a spicy edge. Hints of wood aging show through as the wine opens up, but it's still young, and will need time to bring out its complexity. Drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"A soft, elegant Pinot Noir, this bears flavors of cherry cola and persimmon, with accents of sweet, buttery, toasted oak and cinnamon. Drink now.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Flint and yeast vie with each other to give the first impression of this rich wine. The palate backs this up with concentration and a fluid, soft but defined texture.

"This Riesling has just the right amount of minerality balanced against apple and peach flavors, and an underlying core of lime. Fermented in stainless steel, it is bright and joyful to drink, boasting a long finish. Pour alongside all the classic pairings from Asian takeout to a proper curry.",US-California:Riesling
"Big, meaty and dense, with dampness, earth and size. This is your typical deep and chewy wine, but the structure and core qualities are just above average. Flavors of black cherry, plum and brown sugar are good, while the finish shows a creamy vanilla flavor and cola. Good but not great for the price.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a rich wine, a reminder of the warmth of the Alentejo. That's reinforced by the cork label made from the other major product of the region. It is perfumed, smooth and with hints of apricots as well as brighter pear flavors. Drink now.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese White
"Sassy pepper and light rhubarb aromas give this medium-weight crianza a spicy, lean outlook. The palate has tang, vibrant red fruit and mildly grating acidity, while the finish runs zesty and rings about your mouth as it does a spicy fade. A wine for current consumption.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Crisp and light, this is a bright wine with attractive acidity and fresh fruitiness. It's not a wine for the long-term, with its simple caramel and spice flavors. Drink now.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay

"Sangiovese and Merlot grapes are behind this ripe red. It opens with aromas of fleshy black cherry, black currant, blue flowers and oak-driven spice that carry over to the palate together with a mocha note. Grippy tannins provide the backbone.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend

"Heavy wafts of petrol and oak dominate at first in this wine, before some air and some swirling in the glass reveal more lifted aromas and flavors of lemon candy, green apple and apple tart. A tale of two wines in some ways, it zigzags between crisp and luxurious, finding its balance in the glass.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Smells baked and hot, tastes harsh and dry, a bitter, astringent wine without charm.",US-California:Merlot
"San Vicente is part of the Casa Donoso group, and this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Malbec and Cabernet Franc smells tarry and blackened, with notes of olive, char, cassis and minerals.

Drink through 2022.",Chile-Maule Valley:Red Blend

"Showing the usual balance and harmony of this bottling, which is made from the five Bordeaux varieties, the '06 nonetheless lacks a bit of the richness of other vintages. It's beautifully clean and dry, with sound currant, blackberry, herb tea and cedar flavors, but is missing a certain fatness in the middle. Best now–2012.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A complete wine in every way, this limited (three barrel) reserve opens with solid bass notes of thick wood and dark fruit. That platform of black cherry and cassis is adorned with light touches of pepper, vanilla, mocha and the streak of iron that seems to characterize many McMinnville wines. Drink 2015 through 2030.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This wine, which includes 17% Mourvèdre and 8% Grenache, is a blend of fruit from Arianses, Stone Tree, Ciel du Cheval and Heart of the Hill vineyards.

It's a bold, hedonistic interpretation of the variety, with oak playing a prominent role.",US-Washington:Syrah
"The 2015 harvest produced a bumper crop of excellent Bierzo wines, Baltos included. Aromas of black fruits and violets are full and floral, with a hint of nicely scented candle.

Drink this fairly dense and wholly delicious Mencía trough 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain:Mencía

"This is a big wine, clearly in need of cellaring. There's a massive core of blackberries, cherries and baking chocolate on the palate, but it's rigidly tannic, dry and acidic still. The blend is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 15% Sangiovese, putting it in the super Tuscan category. Give it until 2017 to begin to mellow, and it could still be going strong in 2025.",US-California:Red Blend
"From a selection of old vines in four parcels, the wine has rich fruits, concentrated blackberry flavors and fully integrated tannins. It is ripe, juicy with fine acidity and a good potential. Drink this fine and fruity wine from 2018.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir

"Layered with oak, leather and cigar box, this is a smooth, structured Zin. The palate retains some perfume of red raspberry and dark cherry, but it's quite masculine in its approach and taste.",US-California:Zinfandel
"89-91 Barrel sample. Sweet fruit, soft tannins, ripe wine. The structure takes a while to show with dusty, almost velvet tannins.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Potent and herbal, this has aromas of tomato, olive, mineral and tobacco. It feels tight, drying and lively, with herb-infused flavors of plum and berry along with spicy oak. Rich in feel, but it's distinctly foresty and herbal tasting on the finish. This is 100% Malbec with an undeniable Salta imprint.",Argentina-Other:Malbec

"So thick and rich that it seems to fall apart in the mouth in pieces. There's rum raisin on the bouquet and then backing aromas and flavors of prune, orange rind, toffee, peanut and chocolate. It's rich, sweet and unctuous from start to finish, but with just enough balance and acidity to keep it upright. Sincere and delicious.",Spain-Andalucia:Pedro Ximénez
"This is the young fruity wine from the Cèdre estate that also produces some of the most serious wines in Cahors. It is soft, packed with black fruits and with layers of spicy acidity.

"DeLille's D2 red (51% Merlot/38% Cabernet Sauvignon/8% Cab Franc/3% Petit Verdot) is a declassified wine in the best possible sense—the grapes come from all of the winery's premier vineyard sources. The result is a substantial, even meaty red wine, muscular rather than plump. The fruit is layered and tart, its flavors laced with smoke, tar and licorice. The wine gathers strength in the midpalate, then gradually unfolds through the finish with polished tannins that are just slightly herbal.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"From one of Montalcino's cult producers, this wine leads with earthy aromas of underbrush, truffle, stewed plums and prune. The palate offers overripe black cherries, baked plums, licorice and black spices. It's fast approaching its ideal drinking window so enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"A blend of 40% Cabernet Franc and 40% Malbec, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this appealing offering has aromas of vanilla, woodspice, raspberry and black tea. The cranberry and cherry flavors are restrained in feel, with tart acids that carry through the cranberry-filled finish.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"A terrific value if you like the style, this is an impressively concentrated, slightly syrupy Shiraz imbued with potent cassis fruit and framed with vanilla oak. Surprisingly long on the finish. Drink now.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
"This is a serious blend of Alfrocheiro, Syrah and Touriga Nacional from the Lagoalva estate. Spice and wood go with dark tannins and firm red fruits. It is still a young wine with fine potential. Drink from 2019.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese Red
"A blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine shows tones of red currant juice and geranium. Light in body and tannin, this is mild and approachable.",US-America:Red Blend
"Spicy and minty on the nose, with hard primary aromas and lots of cinnamon. There isn't much fruit or body to this youngster, which seems wood-infused and short on substance. 45,000 cases made.",Chile-Central Valley:Carmenère
"A lightly wood-aged wine, this is floral and spicy. With its pear and citrus flavors, soft texture and fine mature fruit, it is nicely balanced and ready to drink.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese White
"Though the winery indicates that just one quarter of the barrels (all French oak) were new, this wine puts those spicy, toasty scents and flavors of mocha and cinnamon front and center. It's soft and silky, with round, forward flavors of plums dipped in chocolate.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Clean and penetrating on the nose, with leather and warm berry/cherry aromas. Comes across bright and lively, with good balance and an appealing, easygoing set of wild berry and spice flavors. Shows length and follow-through on the finish. Very good for affordable RDD.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"A spectacular Pinot that succeeds due to superior structure and complex flavors. With a silky texture, it feels smooth in the mouth, and shows dry, cool-climate flavors of raspberries, cola, oranges and anise, with the most lovely overlay of smoky oak. Beautiful acidity and finely meshed tannins provide the architecture. Drink now–2014.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Wild berry, tilled earth, new leather and truffle aromas lead the nose of this vibrant red. The linear palate offers tart cherry, cranberry, white pepper and clove flavors, framed by tightly wound, polished tannins and firm acidity. Give it time to fully come together. Drink 2020–2033.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Ripe in dense black cherry, this wine has a pleasant juiciness that keeps it balanced in the glass. A firmness of acidity supports the well-integrated tannins and lithe fruit, while the finish brings a swirl of cinnamon-cola and vanilla.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This opens with aromas of red berry, espresso and a whiff of sawdust. On the palate, raw red cherry is backed up by licorice, toast and roasted coffee bean but it lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak and the youthfully raspy tannins which leave an astringent finish.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Ripe in oak, this Chardonnay has aromas of candied lemon and chiffon, and is crisp in acidity with a taste of wet stone and fresh peach. With layers and depth, the oak rears its head most prominently on the finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This bubbly brings a rich buttery Chardonnay flavor, smooth texture, lively effervescence and rather full body. It smells like toast and butter, and tastes ripe and appley. Intense buttery flavors stay with you on the aftertaste.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"A big, strong, spicy Zinfandel, packed with wild berry, currant, licorice, cola, clove and white pepper flavors that finish dry and tannic. Drink this potent wine with barbecued pork, chicken and beef, slathered in spicy sauce.",US-California:Zinfandel
This is a light and tonic Prosecco Superiore that offers aromas of hay and dried grass backed by peach and citrus. Pair this wine with lightly fried vegetable tempura.,Italy-Veneto:Glera
"Patianna has a very good track record with this unoaked variety, which is grown in the warmer Hopland area of inland Mendocino. The '08 is very dry, very crisp in citrusy acids, and complex, with New Zealand-style flavors of gooseberries, white currants, minerals and geraniums, in addition to riper flavors of pineapples, limes and sweet Meyer lemons.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Tastes fresh and acidic, like a Beaujolais, with jammy blackberries and cherries, and that sharp, tart finish. An everyday red to drink with ham, sausage, paté.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"A beautiful wine, this is rich in citrus, tropical fruit and green apple flavors, with a smoky jacket of oak. The acids and tannins lift it above the ordinary, as does a stony minerality that tastes of the soil.",US-California:Chardonnay
"A rose garden's worth of aromas lift out of the glass in this hearty, full-bodied red, the peppery tannins somewhat grippy on the palate before settling down. Blackberry punches through on the palate, given additional color and lift from the 5% Petit Verdot.",US-California:Cabernet Franc
"A ripe and juicy wine, the wood flavors giving considerable spice character. Acidity and blackberry fruits work into a wine that has an attractive, if rough-at-the-edges, character.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"A simple wine, it tastes overoaked and thin in oranges and apricots, with brisk acidity.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Sweet with a burnt aftertaste, this wine cannot be highly recommended.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Made from grapes picked early specifically for rosé, this bone-dry wine keeps alcohol low and flavors rich. A pale copper hue, it offers flavors that mimic a cava, without the bubbles. Racy minerality underscores a juicy, fruit-driven palate of lemon, lime and orange. A hint of coffee and crème brulée pokes through the refreshing finish.",US-Oregon:Rosé
"The wine is dry, laden with wood flavors rather than fruit. It has a hard over-extracted edge that will stay with the wine as it ages.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The 2012 Pinot from A to Z is bright and fruity, with pure blueberry scents and flavors. It's not a complicated wine, but it's forward and tasty, with compelling juiciness. Tannins are ripe and proportionate.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"A barrel selection from the estate and Shaw vineyards, this spent a couple of years in new French oak. It shows good concentration and oak influence. Cassis fruit is underscored with vivid acidity, and the wine retains its balance through a long finish that offers highlights of smoke and char.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"From the Armagnac region of south-west France, this is herbaceous, cool and crisp, a great aperitif white. It has green fruits, bright texture and lively acidity.",France-Southwest France:White Blend
"Flat aromas of coconut and toasted oak give way to smoky chocolate mocha, red currant and black pepper. A touch soft on the finish, it otherwise drinks full-bodied and powerful.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe and rich, this irresistibly fruity spätlese is concentrated with peach marmalade, guava and grapefruit flavors, but braced by a streak of lemon-lime acidity and a delicate spritz that tickles the palate. Satisfying and juicy, it finishes long with a hint of grapefruit-pith astringency.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"This is a soft, fruity wine that is already mature. It still has berry and red plum fruitiness although this is now integrated with the gentle tannic structure. The freshness comes from juicy acidity that creeps in at the end to leave a fresh aftertaste.",France-Loire Valley:Pinot Noir
"Aromas of mature plum, vanilla, menthol and a touch of exotic spice unfold in the glass. The soft, fruity palate doles out fleshy black cherry, crushed raspberry and a note of baking spice framed in polished, fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2018.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Black cherry and cassis aromas mix with some heat, rubber and harshness on the bouquet. With time it settles into better form, showing rich, bold berry and plum flavors, spice and some heat and scour. Roasted and dark on the finish, and rugged overall.",Chile-Rapel Valley:Merlot
"Marked by excessive heat from high alcohol, with a jalapeño pepper burn all the way through. If you can get past that, it's dry and smoothly tannic, with rich berrry, currant, cocoa and spice flavors.",US-California:Red Blend
"Darkly seductive in cinnamon and blackberry, this wine is hugely mouth-filling and a tad chewy, ready for a gigantic steak off the grill, preferably while out on the range. Coffee and pepper figure prominently in this wine, especially on the finish.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"Full of tropical fruit flavors, this is rounded, ripe and very accessible. At the same time, its structure shows through in the tang of green apple skin, judicious wood aging and taut aftertaste.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"A bit herbal and brambly, with baked, earthy red fruit aromas. Modest raspberry flavors are mostly what you get off the narrow palate, and the finish follows suit as it fades out with a tight, herbal character. Rudimentary Cabernet.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Unfiltered, this is an invitingly earthy wine, marked by truffle and forest, with a generous concentration of black cherry that's impacted quite a bit by oak. Velvety smooth, it's substantial on the palate.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This smells sweet and rubbery up front. The palate is tannic, with a blackberry flavor that starts sweet but turns bitter.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Merlot
"Spindrift's reserve bottling does not seem substantially different from its regular 2005 Pinot, except that it extends its flavors through a much longer and smoother finish. Bright red fruit flavors mix raspberry and blueberry with milk chocolate. An impression of spun sugar wraps up the finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Full and rounded, this warm rosé has some weight. A food-friendly selection, it has a dry, tangy character, textured red-currant flavor and tight final acidity.",France-Southwest France:Rosé
"Lean and bright, this easygoing Vermentino would pair well with fried calamari or vegetable tempura. The palate shows fullness and a fragrant lemon-zest flavor.",Italy-Tuscany:Vermentino
"Right out of the chute this is a fresh, lively with scented with fresh cut pears. It's balanced and crisp, with subtle hints of cinnamon spice. A good spring/summer quaffer.",US-Oregon:Pinot Gris
"This leads with leesy flavors of melon and stone fruits, followed by mild citric acidity that drives the palate. Flavors of stone-fruit pits and nectarine are a touch bitter, while the finish is minerally, with a shot of lemon zest.",Spain-Northern Spain:Chardonnay
"Gritty and rustic, with blackberry, prune and spice flavors. It's a dry, tannic wine, for drinking with simple foods, like burritos.",US-California:Merlot
"This sources grapes from the oldest (1972) blocks at Sagemoor, yielding a deep, rich and intense wine saturated with black cherry, cassis, licorice and barrel flavors. It's perfectly balanced, drinking beautifully, and fit for cellaring over a decade or longer.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made with 70 and 80-year-old Nerello Mascalese vines planted at high altitude, this opens with delicate but enticing scents of leather, menthol, iris, red berry and thyme. The elegantly structured palate doles out juicy black cherry, raspberry, mocha, cinnamon and licorice. Polished tannins, bright acidity and a mineral vein provide the framework.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nerello Mascalese
"Coming from three different blocks of the winery's estate vineyard, it brings notes of cherry cola, peppery spices and medicine cabinet. The fruit flavors are quite ripe and lush, with the use of one year-old French oak putting the fruit front and center.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Tastes sweet and alcoholic, with vegetal flavors that barely break into berries and cocoa.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This vintage-dated Pinot Noir is the newest addition to the Evolution lineup. Tart and tangy, its light and lively pomegranate and raspberry flavors come from grapes principally fermented in stainless steel. In your wine-drinking pantheon, it might find a comfortable place alongside a cru Beaujolais.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This is generous, full of red berry and plum fruits and lined with acidity. It has a firm structure that gives shape to its exuberant fruitiness. Ready to drink now, but it can be aged for another 2–3 years.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Scented with notes of pine needle and lemon polish, this puts its concentration square in the mid-palate. There are pretty traces of honeyed botrytis, and a suggestion of sweetness, though the acidity keeps it on the dry side. Excellent length, with a pretty finish of honey and tea.",US-Washington:Riesling
"Pretty good price for a bone-dry, crisply elegant Sauvignon Blanc with such good flavor. It's citrusy in limes and grapefruits, with richer notes of figs and melons, and finishes with a scour of spice.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine comes from the Guedes family's Carvalhais estate in the heart of the Dão. Only made in better vintages, this latest release is almost at its peak. It has smooth, ripe tannins with leather, spice and acidity rather than the primary fruits. That makes for a sophisticated, complex wine that will be ready to drink from late 2016.",Portugal-Dão:Portuguese Red
"Aggressive smelling early on but then it settles on classy raspberry, cassis and herbs. The palate is very healthy, juicy, rich and big, but the flavors of dark berry fruit are subtle and smooth. Chunky, sweet and ripe on the finish. A Malbec to drink this winter. Only 300 cases produced.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"A heavy chaparral element consumes the nose of this wine, with sagebrush, eucalyptus, pencil lead and just a touch of elderberry fruit. The palate is all about tart cranberries and sour cherries, with a bit of graphite minerality holding it together. It's a brisk and earthy sipper.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Apple blossom, pear, honeysuckle and gin botanical aromas show on the nose of this bottling from eastern Paso Robles. The flavors are very floral and ripe, evoking honeydew melon, candied pear and vanilla.",US-California:Viognier
"Toasty pear and apple aromas are lush and nice for Chilean Chardonnay. The palate shows good grip and a solid feel, while the flavors of smoky apple, bacon, toast and citrus blend nicely. Racy and juicy on the finish.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Chardonnay
"Despite his head-turning concert series at his Buellton winery, John Wright isn't losing sight of good winemaking. This Camp 4 Vineyard blend of 40% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 25% Mourvèdre offers an elegant nose of purple fruit, aromatic herbs and restrained woodiness. Elderberries and dried blueberries emerge once sipped, with cedar down the middle and pepper and Italian herbs on the edges.",US-California:G-S-M
"Sugary sweet in berry-cherry fruit, with a cut of acidity that doesn't feel natural. An awkward wine, but passable.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Hailing from the winery's Cave Spring Vineyard, it's dry in style with notes of notes of lime, slat, and mint backed by tart, mouthwatering acids that draw out the finish.",Canada-Ontario:Riesling
"Tight, crisp and fruity, this is a refreshing and bright wine. Lively acidity cuts right through the lightly mineral texture. Full of fruit, fresh and lively, this should be drunk now.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This is a lavish, layered and lovely wine from an extreme coastal vineyard above Cambria. It shows fresh-cut fennel, wild mint, dried lavender, Earl Grey tea and cran-raspberry aromas on the great nose. The palate's strong herbal character of crushed sagebrush, wild thyme and black pepper spices up the dark plum and strawberry flavors.",US-California:Pinot Noir
A perfect balance of watermelon and strawberry fruit flavors introduce this lovely rosé. It's bone dry and as perfect a companion to your holiday turkey as your mid-summer picnic.,US-Washington:Rosé
"A musky, herbal element rises on the nose of this wine, a majority varietal, with small additions of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Dry and structured, it features soft waves of savory tobacco and tea leaf around crisp cherry and clove.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Shows green, peppery flavors with a strong touch of gooseberry. The combination of acidity and ripe flavors tastes like a lemon candy cough drop. Good, but simple.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
This tangy wine with spice and acidity has kiwi and lime flavors that give a fresh character. The aftertaste is lightly perfumed. Drink now.,France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Harsh in the mouth, with tart acids giving a bite to thin raspberry and tea flavors.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of charred earth, smoke, grilled herb and a balsamic note lead the way. The soft easy-drinking palate offers black cherry, prune, clove and a hint of coffee alongside round, rather fleeting tannins.",Italy-Southern Italy:Aglianico
"The reserve gets a little tighter selection and an extra new oak barrel or two; it brings a broad, strawberry-flavored palate, with accents of pine and forest. The finish is lightly toasty, with a streak of dark chocolate.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Much like the winery's Pinot Gris, this estate-grown Pinot Blanc is built around mineral-infused fruit that is immaculately clean and vividly refreshing. Tart and juicy, with Asian pear, green apple, and lemon/lime acidity.",US-Oregon:Pinot Blanc
"A five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend, this young wine is still pulling itself together, but already shows ripe, substantial, nicely textured components. The crisp black fruits are etched with ripe tannins, and aging in 75% new French oak adds chocolate and espresso tones.",US-Oregon:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Coming from a vineyard best known for its Cabernet Franc, this wine offers aromas of fresh herbs, coffee, cherry and bittersweet chocolate. Cherry and chocolate flavors play well off of each other, with the finish lingering. The barrel influence plays a prominent role.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Steve Bird, who put Thornbury on the map before selling that brand to Villa Maria's owner, is back with a fairly rich, amply endowed Sauvignon Blanc. It's grassier to smell than to taste, with stone fruit and grapefruit flavors and just a hint of herbaceousness on the palate.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"Scratchy, moderately woody aromas of berry fruits are lightly herbal yet direct. This is chunky and wide in feel. Flavors of dark fruits blend with green-herb and rosemary notes, while the finish tastes foresty and lightly herbal. The “five” in the name applies to months in oak.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Radiant and structured, this is initially closed but slowly opens to reveal engaging aromas of woodland berry, violet, star anise, dark cooking spice and a balsamic note. The vibrant, full-bodied palate boasts great energy while offering layers of wild cherry, raspberry, white pepper and licorice. Bright acidity and firm, polished tannins provide balance. Give it time to fully develop. Drink between 2020 and 2035.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Toast, coffee and French oak aromas lead the nose and carry over to the one-dimensional palate along with dried cherry and a hint of dill. Soaring alcohol throws it off balance. Give the raspy tannins another year or two to soften then drink before the fruit dries up completely.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Red Blend
"Aggressively tannic, this is an earthy red wine with a lot of barrel influence. The fruit vanishes into a mélange of pepper, clove, coffee and tannin.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Regular but inviting, with good berry aromas and only a modicum of baked-fruit grit to the nose. The palate is solid and fruity, with lively, grapey berry and black-cherry flavors. Finishes smooth, with chocolate notes. Easygoing, simple Malbec from San Juan province.",Argentina-Other:Malbec
"This wine is packed with bright tropical fruit and citrus aromas and flavors, yet stays balanced and spritely through the long, citrusy finish. It's easy to like and easy to drink.",Australia-South Australia:Chardonnay
"This single-vineyard Grüner is powerful, with concentrated white fruit flavors, floral aromas and great, crisp, fresh acidity. The fruit is ripe, hinting at creamy, with a soft green aftertaste. Screwcap.",Austria-Niederösterreich:Grüner Veltliner
"Elegantly structured, this opens with aromas of tropical fruit, bread crust, nut and a whisper of oak. The round palate delivers lemon zest, pastry cream, pineapple and walnut alongside an elegant perlage. A touch of honey signals the close.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Chardonnay
"Dry, medium-bodied and silky in the mouth, the wine holds pleasant red licorice, red cherry pie, white pepper and sandalwood flavors. Give it some time in the decanter and drink now.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Extremely fresh and lively aromas of soft strawberry and lime pith combine to make a very racy edge to the nose of this bottling from the pioneering property, which was founded as a bubbly house in the early 1980s. There is great energy to the sip, where somewhat sour flavors of Ruby Red grapefruit rind give the wine lots of acidic length.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"Initially lean, but that's partly due to its youth. There is also fine, juicy fruit, pierced through with acidity, but offering tense tannins and some dark plum aftertaste.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"Produced from Grand and Premier Cru vines in the Côte des Blancs, this crisp, mineral-driven wine has intense acidity, citrus flavors and a tight, steely texture. Still young, it needs to age and will be best from 2018.",France-Champagne:Chardonnay
"This wine tests the critic's judgment. Is it just a fruit bomb, bursting with cherries, raspberries and blackberries, enhanced with caramelized oak? Or is it a Cab that needs time? All indications suggest the latter. The tannins are thick and hard, courtesy of the vineyard's high altitude in the Mayacamas Mountains, and the acidity is perfect to protect the wine as it evolves in the bottle. Give it until at least 2017.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Soft and ripe, it is gently fruity with light acidity. Plenty of red berry flavors are cut with a textured edge. Light and stylish, it is a fine apéritif style.",France-Provence:Rosé
"This offers aromas of dill, wet leaves, hay, pickled beets, roasted coffee bean and spearmint. The palate lacks fruit richness, delivering instead espresso and vanilla-sweetened oak. Astringent tannins generate a tongue-drying finish.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Fresh and fruity, this is also a wine with some depth and concentration. Ripe, bright cherry fruits are layered with some firmer tannins as well as acidity. It's drinkable now although it will be better from 2016.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"On the nose, a blast of beeswax and honey provides heady lift. The palate is tooth-breakingly sweet but comes with that honeyed, candied-citrus thrill. Sufficient bright acidity counters all the richness. The mouthfeel is full, oily and viscous, always with that honeycomb and beeswax note, not quite tipping into the savoriness of maple syrup. Despite all the decadent sweetness, the finish is still lip-smacking, clean and endless.",Austria-Burgenland:White Blend
The wine has yeasty aromas although the fruit is all there. Red-berry flavors are cut with a tannic texture and enough acidity to balance. The wine will be better from the end of 2016.,France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Boysenberry and blueberry aromas mixed with oak scents amount to an inviting, solid bouquet. In the mouth, this is healthy, full-bodied and showing plenty of kick. Flavors of berry fruits, plum and roasted notes end with jammy berry flavors and a good texture. Drink now–2015.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Dark gold in color, this is a viscous, buttery and robust wine, with pear, vanilla and stony flavors that keep it from feeling overly dense and rich.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Deep, dense black cherry signals immediately that this is pure, classic Dundee Hills fruit, much of it from Abbey Ridge. Average vine age is 30 years—giving it great penetration and complexity. At first tight and unyielding, it opens with scents of coffee and chocolate, and displays the thick minerality of all the winery's 2012s. Nuanced herbs add a peppery kick to the finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This rich, wood-aged wine has ripe plum fruits and dark tannins. It's still young, but it has a concentrated profile that's full bodied and dense. The fruity aftertaste is well integrated with the tannins. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Fresh and fruity, the wine is ripe, soft and with attractive red berry fruits over acidity. Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon make a happy blend of fruit and gentle structure. Drink now.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese Red
"Concentrated aromas of blackberry come with leather and dried-cheese scents. The palate is full in depth and solid in feel, with flavors of creamy oak, medicinality and blackberry. Feels rich, grabby and tastes resiny on the finish, but there's enough solid black fruit to override the oak.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"A wine given ample time in bottle, this exhibits a fair amount of ripe fruit and honeyed oak and vanilla. The generous offering of apple fritter and crème brûlée retains enough minerality in the background to stay balanced and refined.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Peaches and pears, lemons and grapefruits come together in this harmonious late harvest wine that shows little evidence of botrytis. The high acidity gives it balance and makes it a great foil for fruit-garnished foie gras.",Canada-Ontario:Riesling
"A brassy color and generous fruit flavors define this rich, dry and sophisticated bubbly. It has vivid cherry and white peach flavors, a smooth effervescence, crisp acidity and a lingering finish.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"There's a disagreeable sharpness and harshness to this Merlot. Despite some pleasant cherry, berry and oak flavors and a lush texture, that rough tartness persists through the finish.",US-California:Merlot
"A good effort in a challenging vintage. This has a warm core of round, pretty cherry fruit, with a dash of bitters, sassafras and caramel. It persists through the middle into a Dr. Pepper finish, with details of herb and earth.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"A soft and gently fruity wine that has simple apple flavors and an attractive level of acidity. The wine, with its warm fruit, is ready to drink.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Dal Forno delivers one of the world's most impossibly rich and concentrated red wines. Using grapes sourced from the high-density Monte Lodoletta vineyard, this inky, dark expression oozes with syrupy tones of maraschino, dark chocolate fudge, cinnamon spice, crushed clove and barbecue smoke. In keeping with the wine's legendary reputation for long aging potential, the tannins are rock solid at the moment.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"The Score swings and mostly misses, despite some interested fruit (mostly Merlot) that brings a brambly berry flavor into the mid-palate. There is a fishy undertaste that wraps into the finish, along with a light hint of cocoa.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Right out of the bottle, it's all about acidity and fresh, primary raspberry and cherry jam fruit. Wait until 2018 allow more complex mushroom flavors to emerge, as the wine gradually sheds tannins and develops secondary bottle notes.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A pretty good everyday Merlot, made from all-coastal grapes, not from the Central Valley. The cherry, blackberry and plum flavors are nice, the tannins are smooth, the wine is totally dry. The one negative is a sharp, minty green streak.",US-California:Merlot
"A straight-shooting blend of Sangiovese and Syrah for picnics or weekends away with friends. The wine goes down easy, and offers fresh cherry and blueberry flavors along the way.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"From a steep hillside vineyard that is estate owned and farmed, this wine is pungent in dark fruit and black tea. Elusive at first, it takes time to open and reveal classic Sebastopol Hills elements of earth and black cherry, finishing awash in cardamon.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"With its little seasoning of Muscadelle in the blend, this is an attractively perfumed wine. It has bright acidity, plenty of herbaceous flavors and a final pear and crisp apple aftertaste. Drink from the end of 2015.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Spicy, toasty black-fruit aromas set up a firm palate with wrenching tannic grip. Spicy flavors of dark plum and blackberry are typical of this type of Monastrell blend. Peppery notes and herbal accents are up front on the finish.",Spain-Levante:Red Blend
"Lively but standard amontillado aromas of maple, honey and nuts are a touch fiery. Matching the nose, this is choppy and pulling on the palate. Salty, nutty, intensely dry flavors finish with hard-driving acidity that creates never-ending length.",Spain-Andalucia:Sherry
"Roasted cherries, scorched earth, burnt coffee and dark brown sugar all mingle on the nose and palate of this wine. It's a bit rustic and old school, dusty and a bit dry on the finish. Try it in 2–3 years.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Lots of wood on the nose, and some scents of pickle that reflect the American oak barrels. The flavors follow along, spicy cranberry and raspberry fruit, with streaks of pickle and wood and a burst of alcoholic heat in the finish. The blend includes 17% Mourvèdre.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Few California wines are this rich. It swamps the mouth with the essences of ripe black cherry and chocolate, with accents of red licorice, vanilla and buttered toast. The blend is an interesting one of Malbec, Merlot and Syrah, set off with fine, complex tannins. The action is all on the surface, lacking a bit of complexity, but it is delicious for drinking now.",US-California:Red Blend
"This is a ripe, fruity wine with rich strawberry flavor. Light tannins and just the right amount of acidity make it fresh, juicy and already attractive.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Good concentration, which gives the fruit more plum and black cherry than red raspberry. It's deep and sinuous, with threads of graphite and smoke, but the fruit is the star here, and the wine has the concentration and acidity to cellar well for a decade or more.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Crisp-tart lemon and apple flavors cascade on the palate of this invigorating, fresh Riesling. It's a juicy, approachable off-dry wine that finishes with a bristle of lemon-lime acidity.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"Sweet on the nose, with a lot of mocha, vanilla and candied fruit. The palate is tannic and very oaky for a wine of this level. Flavors of toffee, cocoa, mocha and generic berry fruit show more oak than purity. A good wine but heavy handed with the oak. Contains 15% Syrah.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A light imprint marks this high-toned wine, expressive in crisp green apple, citrus and stone. Fresh in lemony acidity, it builds up to a medium body in the glass, offering impressive complexity and refreshment.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the rest equal parts Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Golden raisin, medicinal notes and abundant barrel spice aromas lead to full but balanced flavors backed by grainy tannins.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Feels hot and Porty in the mouth, although it's very dry, with bitter raisinskin and shriveled cherry flavors. The alcohol approaches 16%.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This wine was made from grapes grown on the Petit Thouars estate by sparkling-wine producer Langlois-Château. It is ripe, deliciously fresh with touches of yellow fruits as well as brighter citrus. Fruity acidity comes in at the end. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley:Sparkling Blend
"The complement to the Camerata from Cadence, this estate-grown blend is 52% Cab Franc and 48% Merlot. There's a juicy core that is delightful, with ripe blackberry and black cherry fruit. Both of the Cara Mia wines see 50% new oak for a full 18 months, and at this early age this shows as aliquorous, almost bourbony aftertaste. The aromatics display dark notes of smoke and coffee, along with some mocha and cracker.",US-Washington:Red Blend
This is a good no-nonsense wine that emphasizes fresh lemon and apple flavors and adds in light oaky elements. It's medium bodied and the texture balances crispness with a touch of buttery richness.,US-California:Chardonnay
"This is a gigantic Cabernet, deeply concentrated and enormously tannic and dry. Waves of black currants, blueberries, violets and sweet toasted oak are wrapped into a firm astringency. This needs plenty of time; hold until 2017, at least.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Soft citrus notes of clementine are streaked with fresh lemon to create this fresh, fruit-driven but very appetizing wine. The body is slender, dry and totally refreshing.",France-Alsace:Riesling

This is one of those complex blends that are a specialty of Tejo. The result is bright and fruity with just enough tannins from the Touriga Nacional to give structure to the bold Alicante Bouschet. Drink now.,Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese Red
"Gramona is known for yeasty, complex sparklers, and this falls into that paradigm. The nose is definitely yeasty, with apple and green melon aromas. It's a bit soft for Cava, but that's because it's an '05 that rested on lees for years. Flavors of toasted bread and apple are long on complexity and short on fruit, but once again that's what distinguishes Gramona from the masses.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"This is a straightforward Cabernet that's dry, tannic and soft in acidity, making it fine to drink now. It has easy flavors of blackberries, black currants and cola.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Delicious now for its rich array of black cherry jam, raspberry tart, mocha, cola, anise and vanilla-cedar flavors, wrapped into an easy, silky mouthfeel. Feels elegant and good, and probably best now through 2011.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Aromas of tropical fruit and pressed white flower take center on this medium-bodied white. On the palate, bright acidity balances out dried yellow fruit, citrus zest and toasted oak. Enjoy now to capture the remaining fruit.",Italy-Central Italy:Trebbiano
"A robust, softly tannic and powerfully ripe wine showing flavors of cherry pie filling, cola, raisins, red licorice and dusty Asian spices. This dry Bordeaux-style blend contains some Petite Sirah, and is at its best now–2012.",US-California:Red Blend
"Heady, beguiling aromatics dominate and invite in this well-made, robustly full-bodied wine, which is spicy and tart in baked plum, cherry, cranberry and a twist of orange. Zesty acidity gives it a kick on the palate, buoyed by a moderate tannin structure.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"North Carolina-based Biltmore turns to Dry Creek for Cabernet, with good results. The wine is dry, full-bodied and tannic, with briary, brambly flavors of sweet, wild blackberries, cherries, chamomile tea, cola and anise. It's a sophisticated wine to drink now, at a fair price.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Earthy slightly rustic aromas suggest compost along with ripe berry fruits. This feels wide and heavy, with an extracted mildly tannic mouthfeel. Prune and blackberry flavors don't see much acidic push, and thus this Tempranillo finishes blocky, ripe and chunky.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Pale pink in the glass, this Pinot Noir-based rosé combines nectarine and watermelon aromas with a citrus spray and rose petal quality that provides both depth and tang on the nose. There is a good charge of acidity on the palate, as well as a grippy texture, while light stone fruit, mandarin orange and lime flavors prove quite mellow yet delicious.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"White pepper aroma. Subtle blackberry fruit reveals itself on the palate, as do some tough tannins. Very dry, with an earthy, tannic finish. Needs a few years to soften up.",US-California:Syrah
"Very ripe and forward Cabernet, with jammy blackberry and cherry, spice and earthy flavors, as well as lots of sweet, toasty oak. It's satisfying to drink now.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Cherry, chocolate and marshmallow aromas need some airing to show their best. This feels plump but also jumpy and nervy, with no shortage of intensity. Lightly spicy tomato, plum and cherry flavors finish long and dry.",Chile-Leyda Valley:Pinot Noir
"A terrific auslese, sweet but balanced near perfectly by lime-like acids. It's stony yet honeyed, concentrated yet somehow light on its feet. Then it's bright, fresh and full of juicy citrus fruit on the finish.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"Snap this one up for its refreshing herbal, lemon and pine-scented nose and its flavorful palate with burnt orange and pineapple tones. More refreshing and subtle than most Chardonnays in this price range, this wine is a good pick for someone who wants a dash of Old World austerity and elegance in their New World wine. Try with arctic char or coho salmon. Best drunk now but will hold a year or so.",Australia-Australia Other:Chardonnay
"Aromas of Middle Eastern spices, pencil eraser, oak grain, red plum and cherry make for a complete nose. This Tempranillo offers good body and a fair amount of oak on the palate along with spicy plum fruit that tastes more oaky and lactic on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo

"This wine pops with aromas of orange peel, raspberry, herb and clove. The jammy fruit flavors are pure in feel and linger on the finish.",US-Washington:Syrah
"While briskly composed, this delicately bubbly blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir envelops the palate with a flurry of delicate foam. Late disgorged, it highlights flavors of pressed apples, pears and the faintest hint of brioche. Drink now.",US-New York:Champagne Blend
"This pure expression of Nero d'Avola has bittersweet aromas of almond and cherry that are set against notes of soda, cassis and wet earth. The wine is aged in stainless steel to maintain the purity of its aromas.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nero d'Avola
"While ethereal in structure, there's a seductively penetrating appeal to this light-footed Pinot Noir. Initially pronounced notes of smoke, dried herb and cedar fade into a dusty rose and cherry perfume. Blossom and sage aromas extend into the palate, lending a sultry flair to brisk Maraschino cherry and raspberry flavors. The finish extends on a pleasant bite of bitter almond.",US-New York:Pinot Noir
"This medium-bodied effort comes across a slightly crisp and lacking in richness, but nevertheless delivers ample raspberry and cherry fruit before ending with some slightly tough tannins. Drink now with grilled meats, or hold through 2017 and see if it mellows a bit.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Full and stocky on the nose, with a mild pine and juniper accent. The palate features good feel and thickness, while the raspberry and plum flavors are complete and juicy. Dry and spicy on the finish, and correct within the global pool of Pinot Noir.",Chile-Bío Bío Valley:Pinot Noir
"The Beckett brothers show their blending skills in this crisp mix of 41% Grenache Blanc, 37% Viognier and 22% Picpoul, which shows apple blossoms, peach and wet stone on the nose. The palate is solidly crisp and texturally grippy, with fresh-cut melon and lime pith served atop tongue-tingling acidity.",US-California:Rhône-style White Blend
"With five years' bottle aging, this Champagne is just beginning to show some attractive signs of maturity. The toasty aroma is followed through on the palate and this toastiness has softened the tight mineral texture of the wine. Drink this balanced wine now.",France-Champagne:Chardonnay
91–93. Barrel sample. There's a dry character to this wine. It's concentrated in tannins with a bitterness that leads to a new-wood and spice character. The fruit is still in the background here.,France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A rich, sweet, honeyed wine, this is full and ripe. It has a style to it, its sweetness and acidity in balance. There is just a hint of dry spice complementing the apricot and lemon flavors. Ready to drink.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"A remarkable wine that manages effortlessly to bring together ripe apricot and sweet pear flavors with a balanced maturity that is so delicious. It has power and richness, but there is also minerality and a hint of a chalky texture. This 1999 needs less aging than previous vintages and can be drunk now.",France-Champagne:Chardonnay
"Almost all varietal (with 2% Malbec) from one of the state's premier sites, this wine draws you into the glass with aromas of coffee, scorched earth, herb, spice and dark fruit. The palate shows a beguiling sense of restraint and detail, with the tannins combed to a fine sheen, perfectly framed acidity and a lengthy finish. It's an exquisite example of the variety that should have a long life ahead of it. It will be best after 2020.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This full-bodied wine combines deep, ripe fruit flavors, light spicy accents and a very firm mouthfeel that begs for a bite of a grilled rosemary lamb chop. The wine pushes the stereotype of wimpy Merlot out of the way and does it with fruit concentration rather than obvious oak. Drink through 2020.",US-California:Merlot
"Smoky notes and a slight hint of chocolate spice this very plummy yet fresh, light-bodied red. The tannins are slight but beautifully present and there is a sense of generosity and richness despite the medium body which is balanced harmoniously.",Austria-Burgenland:St. Laurent

"Cabernet Franc has been the signature wine for Barrister since the first release in 2001. Once again it comes out dark and smoky in the house style, but with more spine and muscle than the Barrister Merlot. It's fully ripe and not at all vegetal, though you will find that it has the characteristic Cab Franc streak of pepper and coffee behind ripe black cherry and cassis fruit.",US-Washington:Cabernet Franc
"Hay yellow in the glass, this rosé isn't pink at all, but offers inviting aromas of seltzer, crushed chalk, light lemon peels and yellow apples. The palate is quite mellow, which is pleasing, showing flavors of cider apple, dough and grapefruit peel.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"Raw aromas of tomato, spice, herbs and pie cherry accurately announce a pointy, lean, scouring palate. This Garnacha from a cool vintage is dominated by red plum, tart cherry and raspberry flavors that finish short and punchy.",Spain-Northern Spain:Garnacha
"Lean and minty. Despite a certain elegance, this Pinot lacks the voluptuous richness you want in a wine of this price. The chilly vintage seems to have taken its toll. There's some good cherry and currant fruit, but the wine falls short. Drink up.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"The pale, pink-gray color indicates how light this wine is. It does have attractive red fruits, crisp acidity and a refreshing shot of green apples, all packaged in a dancing, buoyant body. Drink now.",France-Provence:Rosé
"A little bit off balance, with mild compost and earth on the nose giving way to an angular palate with pointed acids along with flavors of zesty berries and red apple skins.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"A compelling blend of 40% Grenache, 40% Mourvèdre and 20% Syrah, this wine captures your attention from the first sniff. The aromas have a rare mix of fruit, soil, barrel and animal, the sort of complexity that eludes language. It fills the mouth with wild and arresting flavors, sweet cherry fruit, animal, loam, cut tobacco and coffee grounds, all folding into dense, dark tannins.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Coming from four different Tempranillo clones planted at the winery's estate vineyard, it beguiles with notes of saddle leather, dried cherry, dusky spices and citrus spritz. The fruit flavors are polished and the tannins structured—a thoroughly delightful bottle.",US-Oregon:Tempranillo
"Light and smoothly textured, this beautifully crafted wine is earthy in wild strawberry preserves, mushroom and forest floor. With a tannic grip that subsides in the glass, it's built to age but entirely enjoyable now, showing power and concentration on the finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Way too high in alcohol, giving it the ripe, hot, raisiny taste of a simple Port.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This opens with tropical fruit aromas of pineapple, mango and melon that are framed by hints of honeysuckle and sweet spice. The medium-weight palate boasts similar tropical fruit tones, but with an assertive mineral and lime-zest lift on the close, ending fresh and lively. Drink up.",South Africa-Robertson:Chardonnay
"A hint of tropicality hovers above the nose, recalling passion fruit. The palate restricts itself to fresh lemon and green apple. This is light, dry, juicy and refreshing—ideal for a sunny day as a light apéritif.",Austria-Niederösterreich:Riesling
"A feminine, almost soft Pinot Noir, this opens nicely with scents of roses, red fruits, and pine forest. Despite its light color, it has plenty of grip and density in the mouth, even bringing some streaks of light milk chocolate into the finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Exhibiting the roundness of the vintage, this is rich and soft. With notes of almond, yeast and yellow fruit, this is already maturing into a bold, open wine. Ready to drink.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Black fruits are fully ripe, then encased in massive barrel flavors. The overwhelming influence of oak brings a barrage of tobacco, smoke and charred wood. The tannins have a bitter edge.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
The aromas are light and elusive with notes of mineral and pear. It drinks dry with a wash of alcoholic bitterness that runs throughout.,US-Oregon:Riesling
"This wine is a result of careful winemaking in which both oak barrel and aging on the lees is used to render a rounder, creamier feel in the mouth. The excellent 2004 vintage adds fresh notes of apricot and stone fruit to the overall complexity of the nose.",Italy-Lombardy:Chardonnay
"Dried strawberry, herb-laced berry compote, maple and campfire aromas show on the nose of this bottling from one of the earlier Paso pioneers of the modern era. It's soft in texture and rich in syrupy strawberry and plum flavors, enhanced by hints of mocha and held up by firm tannins on the finish.",US-California:Zinfandel
"For six bucks you get a dry, rich, creamy Chardonnay with nice flavors of pineapples, pears, apples and smoky vanilla. This is a great price for a wine of this polished appeal.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This will likely prove a bit too vegetal for some, as the aromas hint at asparagus. But there's pineapple and honey on the palate and decent weight in the mouth.",Australia-South Australia:Sauvignon Blanc
"Purple in color and smells like sweet fruit, citrus peel and powdered drink mix. Round in the mouth, with generic plum and berry flavors that don't taste all that much like classic Pinot Noir. A simple, bulky wine that's young and probably not going very far.",Argentina-Other:Pinot Noir
"Ripe and chewy, this earthy wine opens with aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, scorched soil, grilled herb and game. The big, round palate doles out ripe blackberry, spiced blueberry, licorice and ground pepper alongside velvety tannins.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Red Blend
"The first Bishop Creek designation from Erath, this dark-toned, deep and concentrated Pinot Noir is one to cellar. The fruit is seamless, sappy and dense, suggesting a mix of ripe berries. Fourteen months in French oak, about 40% new, seems just right, as the barrel notes of toast and coffee dance around the juicy berry flavors without smothering them.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"A smooth, velvet textured wine. It has some weight, but the balance is what is most attractive about this wine. It has spice, crisp black currant fruits and intense freshness that tips over into final acidity.",France-Southwest France:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Vibrant and savory, this blend of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Colorino boasts juicy black cherry, blackberry and raspberry flavors, while notes of white pepper and cinnamon add depth. It's balanced and delicious with fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2016.",Italy-Central Italy:Red Blend
"This shows how a wine can be both immediately delicious and drinkable, yet possess that extra stuffing to make it complex and ageable. It offers generous raspberry, cherry, chocolate, vanilla and spice flavors, balanced with gorgeous acidity and a hint of dusty tannins. Drink now–2018.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"The northernmost of the Beaujolais cru villages can produce wines that are Burgundian in their structure. This wine fits that profile well with its dark tannins and rich concentration. Densely textured with both black-cherry fruit and a dry core, the wine is taking its time to develop. Drink from late 2017 or 2018.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Tomato, savory spice and earthy, mildly stewed red-fruit aromas lead to a crisp palate with firm acids and flavors of tomato, raspberry, herbs, vanilla and dried cheese.

"Les Cimels is a solid, entry-level Costières de Nîmes blend of Syrah, Carignan and Grenache.

Long and mouthwatering on the finish.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is a light, bright white-flower-perfumed wine, and it offers fresh, apple-like acidity, a crisp texture and an edge of lemon zest. For drinking soon.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"A voluptuous blockbuster in the style we are becoming accustomed to from über-consultant Michel Rolland: big, deeply fruited (black cherries) and plush, with elegantly etched spice shadings from new oak. The tannins are supple but substantial; it should age for a long time. Made entirely from old-vine Malbec and named after the pigeon coop in the Château's courtyard.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"Cecchetti Wine Company makes a lot of Line 39 Sauvignon Blanc, but does it well, offering an affordable wine that tastes great. Grassy and tropical, it's true to Lake County, with just a touch of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc character. Crisp and easy to drink.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"This popular brand's white version is soft and smooth. There are some citrus flavors to give the wine a crisp edge, although the main thrust of the wine is more towards apricot and perfumed green plums. Drink now.",Portugal-Alentejo:Portuguese White
"The nose on this lighter-bodied gran reserva offers hints of raw oak and paint along with more standard red berry and plum scents. The mouthfeel is lively, edgy and just deep enough, while flavors of oak and berry fruits taste a bit baked and generic.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"Overripe and raisiny, with sweet, shriveled blackberry and oak flavors, leading to a hot finish. Drink now.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"A ripe, citrus and grassy wine that blends a good dollop of Sémillon with the Sauvignon Blanc. It's full and fresh, cut with citrus and very fruity. Drink now and until 2019.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Mild, innocuous aromas of white fruits are pleasant but undefined. This feels round and benefits from acidic lift, while flavors of orange and nectarine finish in a friendly manner. This is mostly Viura with some Verdejo and Sauvignon Blanc.",Spain-Central Spain:White Blend
"Strong's Symmetry almost qualifies as a Cabernet Sauvignon, with 71% of that variety, and the rest consisting of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. The Meritage labeling identifies it as their supreme bottling of a Bordeaux-style wine. Easily the best Symmetry ever, it is a great wine. Dry and somewhat astringent in tannins, it has an impressively deep core of blackberries and currants, with an array of sweet herbs, chocolate and tobacco. It's delicious now, and should slowly develop bottle complexities over the next 10 years.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This full-bodied wine is complex and detailed from the spicy perfume to the finish, and rich and satisfying in the middle. Aromas like black tea and rhubarb lead to ripe and deep cherry and slightly tangy raspberry flavors that are lifted by moderate tannins and linger on the finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"An impressive wine that presents a full bouquet with bready, leesy, toasty aromas, and intriguing lemon and caramel hints.

There’s a long full finish to this top-notch American sparkler.",US-California:Champagne Blend
"This wine is predominantly Merlot (44%) along with a whopping 33% Petit Verdot, with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec.

A rock-solid wine for beef and pastas.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec

"An impression of this light-bodied wine starts with a vivid golden-yellow color and enticing aromas of fresh bread dough and marzipan. The taste itself is more lean than the aromas, showing crisp lemon and apricot notes, noticeable acidity and a tart finish. It has a taut, dry character that is not typical in California, but the wine is fascinating and keeps improving for a day or two after opening.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Fondillón represents the pinnacle of red Spanish dessert wines, and the 1999 vintage just might make your jaw drop. Subtle but expansive on the nose, with a blend of baked dark-fruit and cinnamon aromas, it is liquid heaven in the mouth, with excellent balance and flavors of roasted plums, black cherry, nutmeg and chocolate. This is pure, structured and outstanding from start to finish. Drink now or hold in a proper cellar for another 10 or 20 years. 100 cases made.",Spain-Levante:Monastrell
"Big, rich and sappy, this tastes like cherry and raspberry jam that has been boiled down and made into wine—a suggestion of its youth. It is very fine, with keen acidity and a noble structure tinged with minerality. Give it 3–5 years to age.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Soft, smooth and sweet, this is a basic wine with raisin and prune flavors. It won't please those who normally drink dry varietal wines.",US-California:Red Blend
"This wine is produced from old-vine Pinot Noir planted on flint soil. The wood from the wine's aging does show, giving a spicy, smoky character that is still dominating the red-cherry fruits. This will balance out over the next few months to give a wine with concentration. The aftertaste brings out acidity. Drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley:Pinot Noir

The wine weaves together cherry, dark chocolate and espresso with plenty of tart acidity to buoy it up.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Famed winemaker Cathy Corison brings her restrained touch to this Cabernet for Lookout Ridge's guest winemaker series, which benefits charity.

Made from Corison's Kronos Vineyard, it will be best after 2011.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

Drink now–2017.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Vigna Manapetra's inky dark concentration is noticeable from afar and gives this Brunello a brawny and dark personality.

It's almost too much of a good thing with smooth, evolved tannins and a touch of bitter fruit on the close.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso

"Very oaky and very ripe, offering a flood of pineapple jam, pear, vanilla and toasty oak flavors. Crisp acidity provides needed balance and a clean, brisk mouthfeel.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This nose features much more nuance than a typical Sauvignon Blanc, with chalky minerality, bright stone fruit and barely ripe tropicality. It's a bit tight at first on the palate, but poached pear and papaya flavors emerge, then open to candied guava in the midpalate.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Jaboulet's view of its most famous wine seems to have changed. Although the concentrated, dense tannins and big black fruit flavors are still there, it has lost the huge brooding presence of past vintages, and now has a veneer of sophistication with superripe fruit, plums and dark jam tastes. Whether this 1999 will age as well as older vintages remains to be seen, but it will certainly be ready to drink sooner.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"A heavy-handed Chardonnay, sugary sweet in granola pear, pineapple, roasted nut, honey, butterscotch and vanilla cream flavors. Everything's good except that excessive sweetness, which makes the finish common.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Another impressive bargain-priced 2015 Sauvignon Blanc. Consumers looking for summer 2017 refreshment should grab some of this for its crisp flavors of pineapple, passion fruit and grapefruit. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"What a nice wine. It's so dry, acidically crisp, and so balanced, it puts many more expensive California Sauvignon Blancs to shame. There's no oak in this screwtopped wine, nothing to muck up the pure, fresh citrus and fig flavors. The winemaker has allowed high natural acidity to remain, which makes everything ultraclean and savory.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Chehalem makes four different Rieslings, and this is often the best of them. Rich and complex, it's dense with grapefruit, lemon, lime, apple and flavors of wet stone. Lovely in the mouth, it lingers gracefully through the finish.",US-Oregon:Riesling
"A good buy for its dryness and overall balance. You won't mistake it for a cult Cabernet, but the blackberry and currant flavors work.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"The emphasis here is on elegance and the wine delivers a lighter mouthfeel with delicate layers of fresh berry, Mediterranean herbs, oregano and rosemary. There's nice fullness in the mouth, polished tannins and an overall delicate style.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"This is an unusual blend of 55% Sauvignon Blanc, 39% Chardonnay and 6% Viognier from a selection of fine vineyard sites, including Maldonado. Baked pineapple, mango, anise and lemongrass ride along tightly grained texture and a tension of acidity, finding a manageable weight of viscosity on the finish.",US-California:White Blend
"Great ripe fruits here, peach and apricot flavors layered with intense white currant acidity. The wine has an edgy feel to it, its acidity bright and taut. Give the wine a year for its elements to blend together.",Austria-Kremstal:Riesling
"The wine is structured and still firm, showing tight tannins and acidity over the red fruits. A cool edge elicits the fresher character of the fruits. Drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"This medium-bodied wine features fresh cherry aromas accented by hints of vanilla. While it doesn't offer much in the way of complexity, it does deliver ripe fruit, a soft texture and a realistic price tag. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Pinot Noir
"This is a vineyard blend of many varieties, dominated by 24% Syrah, 20% Sangiovese and 12% Zinfandel, the balance a mishmash of Cinsaut, Dolcetto and other rare grapes. Floral in orange peel and violets, it's also meaty and buoyant in acidity, the remaining flavors sexy in red fruit like pomegranate and raspberry. This is a delightfully complex and unique wine.",US-California:Red Blend
"Yellow pear, Golden Delicious apple and a dollop of honey create a fruitful, inviting and friendly opening, countered by lemony freshness that keeps things on the right side of fruity opulence. Drink this wine while its aromas are at their height.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"The wine has a jammy character that gives it concentration. It is sweet although with enough acidity. The blackberry jelly flavors are firmed out with some fine tannins, certainly plenty to promise good aging. Drink from 2025.",Portugal-Port:Port
"Borra's blend of 80% Petite Sirah, 10% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre has three strong personalities vying for attention with Petite Sirah definitely dominant in juicy, blueberry fruit and a core of dusty tannins, with just a suggestion of meaty game. Structured this is a nice wine to pair with a rich risotto or leg of lamb.",US-California:Red Blend
"Easy-going in spite of full body, this warm and generous wine is full of ripe fruit flavors and has a smooth texture. The fresh cherry and raspberry flavors are tasty and satisfying, while very light tannins keep the mouth-feel soft.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Sourced from a high-altitude vineyard near the top of the Awatere Valley, this wine shows some of the leafiness characteristic of the region. The fruit is more roasted root vegetable than tree fruit, with a potent savory and fairly muscular character.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Pinot Noir
"Perhaps it's because of the stem inclusion, but this wine is amazingly floral and spicy on the nose. On the palate, it's just a little creamy in texture, with savory elements that balance raspberry underpinnings. Tannins are supple, making it deceptively easy to drink now, although it should age well through at least 2016. The blend is 35% Mourvèdre, 35% Grenache and 30% Syrah.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"A blend of Cab and Syrah grown on one of the winery's mountain vineyards, this first-rate wine demands time in the cellar. Bone dry, it shows dramatic layers of blackberries, currants, plums, dark chocolate, herbs and spices, wrapped in a firmly tannic, complex structure. Has that inimitable feeling of importance, but it would be a shame to pop the cork before late in 2008. Should come into its own 2009–2012.",US-California:Red Blend
"Simultaneously light yet earthy, this shows cherry pie, concentrated pomegranate, whole nutmeg, buttery crust and intriguing brown spices on the nose. There is a bit less action on the palate, but still plenty of tart cherries, tobacco and brown spice elements.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This wine is softly fruity, not matched with the dry tannic structure. It is juicy, perfumed and with tight acidity. A hint of sweetness throws the fruit off balance.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Hints of evergreen lend a cool, alpine air to fresh apple and lemon aromas on this brisk, lean wine. Off-dry in style, the palate is sprayed with delicate rose petal notes and fresh apple and lime flavors. Finishes long with an elegant crushed-stone minerality.",US-New York:Riesling
"Made from 100% dried Zibibbo grapes, this classic dessert wine opens with intense raw apricot, date and orange marmalade aromas. It's fresh, full-bodied and elegant on palate, with layers of ripe fig, tangerine zest, chestnut honey and eucalyptus flavors that persist long into the finish.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Zibibbo
"A full, fruity, slightly hot Chardonnay. The barrel aging—all French, 60% new—brings the expected toastiness. This is a solidly made, fruit-forward style, immediately ready for drinking.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"A beautiful wine that tastes much richer than you usually get for this price. Shows gorgeously ripe blackberry, cherry, currant, mocha, licorice, bacon and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into refined tannins and finishing long and spicy. A blend of Syrah, Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon.",US-California:Red Blend
"Aromas of ripe black plum, cooking spice and scorched earth lead the nose. The robust, bulky palate offers prune, dried cherry, vanilla and a hint of white pepper set against bracing tannins while the heat of scorching alcohol throws it off balance. Drink soon to catch the remaining fruit.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Coming from the winery's estate vineyard high up in Upper Mill Creek, this wine is starting to show a bit of age, offering aromas of anise, dried cherry, green pepper and cigar ash. Equal parts dark and green, the flavors come off a bit disjointed, with bell-pepper notes on the finish.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Starts out odd and exotic, with blueberry and Middle Eastern spice aromas. Feels condensed and jammy, with full flavors of herbs, boysenberry and plum. Shows freshness along with simplicity, with finishing herbal notes of sage and tarragon. Contains 10% each Merlot and Cabernet.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"Lush and decadent, with intensely sweet notes of demarara syrup, peach and citrus, yet there's enough acidity to bring you back for another sip, and another. The sugar clings to the palate for a long time on the finish. Drink now–2030.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"Pear, melon and white peach aromas are followed by rounded tropical-fruit flavors that drink off dry. It's enjoyable but the sugar seems a bit out of place.",US-Washington:Pinot Gris
"This is a dense and rich wine full of black plum fruits, rich tannins and a dark structure. It has great potential. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The aromas offer notes of cocoa, herb, cedar, cherry and barrel spice. The palate is somewhat barrel-forward but otherwise shows a pleasing sense of balance along with a lingering finish.",US-Washington:Merlot
"This wine is chunky and firm, and its lively red fruit brings freshness. With its dry core and touch of toast on the finish, this could age for a couple of years.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Allen Vineyard grapes have the maturity and complexity to impart a boldly balanced roundness of lemon curd, fig and apple, plus a searing undercurrent of salty minerality. With substantial weight, and texture for miles, it remains bright and fresh in the glass, with a lingering impression of cinnamon toast.",US-California:Chardonnay
"True to its name, this blend is tangy in acidity. Flavorwise, it's simple, with pleasant orange, peach, lemon and vanilla flavors that finish a little sweet.",US-California:White Blend
"This Nebbiolo by Mario Pelassa is loaded with aromas that recall Christmas spice, chopped mint and nutmeg. There's an incredibly strong balsam note here that resembles eucalyptus and peppermint. Pair this wine with lamb and mint jelly.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Massive. Made from 100% Cabernet, and lavish in new French oak, it's an impressive wine, but not one you want to open now. Everything is on steroids, with a heart of blackberries and currants just waiting to emerge. Cellar through 2011 and try again.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Always a top cuvée for Sineann, this refined and detailed effort shows distinct mineral notes in both its nose and its finish. Concentrated raspberry and plum fruit is lightly dusted with cocoa powder, and the extended finish has highlights of baking spices.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This is a firm wine with ripe Merlot fruits that are still sheathed in tannins. Densely textured, it is rich with berries and a stalky character that needs to soften. Wait for this solid, concentrated and ageworthy wine until 2017.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is bright and smooth, with forward berry fruit and just the right amount of chocolaty oak. Supple and tangy, with a lip-smacking finish.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This full-bodied and densely textured wine has a deep color, aromas like wood smoke and blackberries, and flavors that saturate the palate with berries, clove and dark chocolate notes. It's bold in body, has plenty of tannins for grip, and a lingering, rich finish.",US-California:Mourvèdre
"This light-bodied wine has honeydew melon and cucumber aromas, subtle fruit flavors and a smooth soft texture. It's easy to sip and is low in acidity.",US-California:Pinot Grigio
"The warm climate of the Barossa is reflected in the heavy, sweet fruit flavors. The melon, guava and honey aromas and flavors lack zip and definition but certainly don't lack for ripeness.",Australia-South Australia:Chardonnay
"Sophisticated, with tertiary aromas of crushed mineral, asphalt, cola, dried mint, wild berry and cassis. On the palate, it's tight, compact and linear, with a long, polished finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Lots of white flowers, from jasmine to lilies, show on the nose of this well-priced bottling, alongside poached pears and lime sorbet. The palate packs tangy pungency, with Anjou pear and Granny Smith apple flavors.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Aromas of coffee, chocolate and fresh herbs are followed by grainy dark fruit flavors. The tannins need some time to stretch their legs.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Orange and mandarin flavors mark this warm, full-bodied wine. It's forward and fruity, showing a sweeter character, with vanilla and spice tones. Drink soon.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"For the year, this is a big wine, a success. New wood flavors and tannins blend well with the weight of fruit, depth of flavor and concentration. The wine has freshness to give with the structure, solid and intense. Certainly for aging—five years and more.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Relentless is Shafer's Syrah-based red wine. It's always rich, ripe and bold, and the 2009 is no exception. The alcohol is very high, making the wine heady and warm. If you can get past that, you'll find a huge wine, massive in blackberry, plump raisin and chocolate flavors, with soft tannins and a long, sweet finish. The blend contains 18% Petite Sirah.",US-California:Red Blend
This wine sports a green-apple and pear nose with some extra weight from barrel fermentation. Well-balanced and right on the border between stainless- steel and barrel-fermented styles: steel meets butter on the palate. Best Buy.,US-Washington:Chardonnay
"Firm and tartly wound, with cassis and black cherry at the core of a young, stiffly tannic, Cabernet-based blend. Black fruits are nuanced with earth and olive, smoke and graphite, all subtle but definitely in view.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"With a rare if tiny showing for the Blaufränkisch grape (3%), which this estate grows on their Los Olives property, this is a tangy, tart and lean Syrah, with bright cherry fruit, coffee, light menthol, tobacco and cedar on the nose. Aromatic wood flavors of pipe smoke and cigar box show on the palate, along with red cherry fruit, vanilla and sagebrush elements.",US-California:Syrah
"This lively white opens with aromas of grapefruit, light oak and crushed rock. On the racy palate, zesty acidity underscores yellow peach, citrus zest, ginger and a hint of vanilla. A hint of mineral marks the finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon
"Soft vanilla hints of oak creep into the mossy aromatic hints of green and yellow pear. There also is a generous core of ripe fruit, almost reminiscent of lychee. While this is fresh with citrus, the deep mellowness and gliding fluidity of the palate will win you over. The finish is clean and lasting.",Austria-Wagram:Grüner Veltliner
"A pretty copper-salmon color, this wine is dry and tart with acidity, but rich in feel. It's complex on the palate with flavors of citrus, peach, orange zest, vanilla and yeast. A minor detraction is the texture, which is a bit aggressive. Drink now.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"Summer where art thou? This zippy, simple but ultrarefreshing and light-bodied Grüner, with green pear crispness, is just the thing for hot days. Drink soon.",Austria-Niederösterreich:Grüner Veltliner

"Dense and tannic, a firmly wood- and stalky-fruit based wine. Black currant fruits and dry tannins are the prominent characteristics. On the finish, the fruit shows a juicier feel.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This perfumed, spicy wine has crisp red fruit and acidity. Light and with a soft aftertaste, it's attractive and ready to drink.",France-France Other:Rosé
"Minute quantities of these rare Viogniers are produced, which is a shame, because they are distinctive and enlightening. Deep gold and intensely aromatic with brilliant floral notes, this is a beautifully balanced wine, with the acidity and skin flavors to put a crisp frame around the ripe peach and apricot fruit.",US-Oregon:Viognier
"Richly layered with fruit, this full-bodied Bordeaux-style blend has wonderful concentration, a good sense of depth and a creamy texture that has mild and supportive tannins. The mouthfeel is very supple and the dark berry and black-cherry flavors are ripe and delicious.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Intriguing in tobacco and a sense of the forest, especially pine, this soft, chewy, fuller wine finishes quickly in black pepper.",US-California:Syrah
"Kudos to Siduri for offering a serious Oregon Pinot Noir at alcohol levels (13%) reminiscent of Burgundy. It's a welcome tilt for the state that once was tagged as the new world's Burgundian hope, but which has sometimes seemed more like a California wannabe. Light and tart, this isn't a complex wine but brings the delicate nuances of the grape, with cranberry, citrus and strawberry.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"From Chanson's five-acre parcel of the Beaune Grèves vineyard, this is a ripe, softly tannic wine, more dominated by strawberry flavors, rich and deliciously sweet. Not for long-term aging, but worth 2–3 years' waiting.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"This massive wine is powered by dark, concentrated and smoky tannins that are masking the fruit. Dry and dense, it will take many years for the black fruits behind the facade to develop. Drink this intense wine from 2025.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Light, clean and citrusy aromas of lemon, lime and grapefruit skin meet with a dollop of white peach and dusting of crushed slate on the nose of this wine. A fine-pointed acidity carries nectarine, pluot and Asian pear flavors across the palate, which trends racy, bright and slightly sour, with a chalky structure.",US-California:Chardonnay
"With plenty of solid tannins to keep the structure firm, this is also based around fresh black fruits. The two elements have produced a wine that, as it matures, will become balanced and poised. It's not dense, but presents elegant structure that has enough richness. Drink this wine from 2018.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"Despite the fancy name, this is a pretty standard wine. It's dry and acidic, with the big tannins that mark Petite Sirah. The blackberry flavors are rich, but cloaked in bitter astringency. Doesn't seem worthwhile to age it, so drink up.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"This Malbec-driven blend is concentrated up front, with staunch aromas of espresso, balsamic vinegar, leather, raw oak and mixed black fruits. This is big and lush, but vaguely focused on the midpalate. Flavors of berry fruits, toast and balsamic brine end with cushion and moderate structure. Drink through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Red Blend
"Serious Sauvignon Blanc from the Saget home domaine, this full and ripe wine has considerable depth of flavor. Like many wines from Pouilly, it is for aging, a rich, concentrated wine that needs at 3–4 years.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Made from Sangiovese blended with 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with aromas of sawdust, oak, exotic spice and a whiff of black currant. The palate displays toasted oak, roasted coffee beans, menthol, ground black pepper and dried black cherries alongside grippy tannins that leave an astringent finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Blackberry, boysenberry, smoke and grilled meat flavors fill this rich, well-balanced and medium to full-bodied wine. The aromas are charming and appetizing, making it seem ready to drink now. However, the mouthfeel is very firm with tannins and acidity, signaling that the wine should age well through at least 2020.",US-California:Syrah
"Light, fresh and fruity, this is a lime and lemon flavored wine. It has a tangy, textured character that blends easily with the acidity. From a blend led by Grenache and Cinsault, it's a lively wine that will be a great apéritif.",France-Provence:Rosé
"Burned tire rubber, oak, espresso and roasted coffee bean lead the nose on this extracted wine. The dense, monolithic palate offers sweet vanilla, toasted oak, chocolate, stewed prunes marinated in spirits, and overripe, sugary plum. It's already evolved and lacks energy.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Dense tannins and powerful black fruits reinforce the almost-black color of the wine. It is a strong wine, powered by dark plums, rich tannins and very fine acidity. Produced from organic grapes, it is an impressive wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2020.",France-Southwest France:Tannat
"Tart with acidity but lush with fruit, this is a lovely Chardonnay to drink with shellfish dishes. Honeyed notes accompany flavors of tropical fruit, Meyer lemon and lime. Oak lends touches of vanilla and a creaminess that finishes clean.",US-California:Chardonnay
"The flavors on this big Zin go beyond ripe blackberries and cherries to include currants, prunes and raisins. High alcohol gives it a glycerine sweetness throughout and a Port-like heat. Enjoy it with barbecue.",US-California:Zinfandel

"Concentrated and luscious, this has notes of dried apricot and fig, with a dense texture reminiscent of honey and orange marmalade. It has a strong mineral structure that melds with the ripe generosity. Savor this intense wine alone at the end of a meal or with blue cheese.",France-Southwest France:Petit Manseng

"A blend of Chardonnay and Arinto, this wood-aged wine is rich and packed with both toast and fruit flavors. Vanilla and apple and citrus acidity are generously pulled together by the mineral texture and ripe structure. The wine will be best from 2017.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese White
"From the oldest commercial vineyard in Santa Barbara County comes this heady bottling, showing aromas of deep black raspberry, vanilla bean, beef carpaccio, black pepper and sesame oil. Black and white pepper and bay leaf spice up the acid- and mineral-laced palate, where dark but sharply focused fruits of elderberry and boysenberry gain a savory touch from smoked pork.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Name and reputation get you only so far, as this underwhelming offering from a poor vintage proves. Compact stewy aromas of baked berry fruits and asphalt are the appetizer. A main course of chunky jammy stewy berry and prune flavors finishes with a desiccated essence. Unico is known to age for decades, but not this vintage. Drink now for what it's worth.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
The tannins and high toast flavors have taken over this wine. The fruit has been submerged. It is difficult to see this completely balancing out.,France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"In a light, fresh style, this is an attractive red berry fruited wine. There are light tannins, soft strawberry flavors and a light acidity.",France-Southwest France:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Light and a little cloudy in the glass, this is a delicious and deep wine from a vineyard in the eastern Salinas Valley, with lime blossoms, squeezed lemons, wet cement and salted white peach on the nose. The palate deftly pairs chalk, sour cream, and lime zest with dried white peach, sea salt and fresh churned butter.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Grown in the Sebastopol Hills area, this Pinot tastes very young and jammy and immature. Released at less than a year of age, it's thick and a little heavy, with cherry, currant and mocha flavors not yet meshed with oak. One wonders why the winery didn't hold it back another year or so. But it could develop in the bottle. Try after 2010.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Cabernet Franc makes up two-thirds of this wine with the rest Merlot. It dazzles with aromas of flowers, red fruit and mineral that are followed by generous amounts of dark fruit along with cranberry-like acidity.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Slightly ethereal notes of camphor play ever so slightly above the lemony nose. The palate is light-bodied, completely citrus-driven and very refreshing. Yellow plums beckon between the lemony zestiness and make for a slightly richer finish on this super-slender wine.",Austria-Wachau:Riesling
"Hints of green pepper and sweet spice add character to the more standard notes of plum guts and ripe cherry. Lighter weight but round in the mouth with good balance and a clean, medium-length finish. Drink now.",Israel-Galilee:Merlot

"Showing considerable wood flavor, this wine has some tough tannins to overcome before it really shows its best. The fruit is ripe, full and packed with blackberry flavors. Once fully integrated, the wine should reveal more of a luscious side. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This straight Barolo has an exotic fragrance of spice, sandalwood and incense, while the palate shows ripe raspberry, spice and balsamic herbs. It's tannic and shy on acidity, typical of the hot 2007 vintage. Drink now.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
Earthy tones of warm leather and spice set the stage for this easy-going Cabernet Sauvignon from Sicily. Pair it with everyday dinners or pasta.,Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Produced from the estate vineyard's oldest vines, this CSV bottling is a dry, leesy, textural wine, with dominant flavors of citrus flesh and rind along with green apples. There's a strong streak of mineral also, and a well-balanced finish of medium length.",Canada-Ontario:Riesling
"Made in a cooler, lighter-bodied style, this wine appeals with cedar and wild strawberry, integrating the oak and letting the tannins mellow in the background.",US-California:Zinfandel

"Youthful and fresh, this opens with aromas of dark berry, moist underbrush and a whiff of violet. The bright, easygoing palate offers tart cherry, orange zest and a whisper of clove alongside zesty acidity and relaxed tannins.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Despite being an Extra Dry Prosecco Superiore, this shows more dryness than it does sweetness. The finish is tonic and firm, with notes of white flower, peach and honey.",Italy-Veneto:Glera
"Sharp acidity and sugary sweet, jammy raspberry and cherry flavors give this wine a distinctly rustic feel. It shows the silkiness you want in a Pinot Noir, but is disappointing for the price.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"88–90. Barrel sample. Signs of very ripe fruit are everywhere on this wine with soft tannins and a rich, sweet plum character. The palate is forward and likely to age fast.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Ripe and smooth, this is rich with red berries. A touch of pepper accompanies a zesty texture that backs up the fruitiness. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux:Rosé
"Ian Brand's stab at this grape shows a lot of black rock minerality and bloody meats on the nose, layered across blueberry syrup and sour cherry elements. The palate is much lighter than other takes on this varietal, showing menthol-laced flavors of blackberries and tobacco.",US-California:Petite Sirah

"This is a terrific Zinfandel, offering berry, cherry, mocha, spice and cedar flavors that come wrapped in briary tannins. It's technically dry, but with a satisfying honeyed note.",US-California:Zinfandel
"The wine is ripe and perfumed. It suffers from high alcohol that comes through in the peppery edge to the otherwise full-bodied black fruits. The wine is balanced, now mature and with an intense juicy aftertaste.",Portugal-Alentejano:Syrah
"Choosing favorites among Kumeu River's Chardonnays is always difficult. The 2013 Maté's is potentially the longest lived of this year's releases, showcasing tight, crisp citrus fruit garnished with hints of butter, tropical fruit and mocha-like oak. Drink 2018–2025.",New Zealand-Kumeu:Chardonnay

"With its superb tannins, the wine has a great solid core of structure. Over it is an edifice of direct black berry fruits, elegant texture and intense acidity. Impressive, a wine for aging.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Pale in color, this wine is aromatically quiet with notes of berry and herb, while the smoke notes emerge over time. The flavors are full and juicy but still bring a sense of delicacy, with a lingering finish. Give it time to open up.",US-Washington:Pinot Noir
"Sauvignon Blanc has been a consistent performer for Hanna, usually yielding a rich, ripe wine with brisk acidity. The '11 is one of their best efforts. It's tart, clean and savory, with the pineapple, tangerine and Meyer lemon flavors touched with a slight sweetness.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc

"The blend is 50% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 17% Cabernet Franc, aged in 100% new French oak.

"Fermented and aged in large Slavonian oak, this unusual, copper-colored wine opens with scents of wildflower, red berry, baking spice and a balsamic note.

A white pepper note closes the finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Grigio
"This blend has a big, dark, toasty edge to the tannins, and plenty of ripe fruit. Meaty and rich, the color of ink, it skirts a pruney border, tosses in some earth and leather and soy, and overall shows plenty of power. A great drink-it-now wine.",US-Washington:Red Blend

This is big, dark and herbal, finishing with hints of leather, tomato and oregano.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec

The texture is almost thick and drenched with fine tannins while the body is quite full as well.",US-California:Red Blend

"The 2003, though still just 13% alcohol, seems to have more stiffness to the structure, more tannin and more density than the 2002. It's harder, chewier, less open and more challenging. It may also age more slowly. Right now there is a certain stemminess and bitterness to the tannins that keeps the fruit at bay, though the aromas seem to promise more. It may profit from an hour or two of breathing.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir

"Warm touches of lemon-laced chamomile tea, soft butter and a dollop of orange sherbert show on the nose of this intriguing and unique wine from the Sierra Madre Vineyard.

The wine is juicy yet also a little creamy, with raspberry and plum flavors that are broad and flow nicely across the palate and onto the wide, chewy finish.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Over the years, Villa Maria has been working hard on upping the quality (and the price) of its entry-level Sauvignon Blanc. No longer a Best Buy candidate, the 2008 Private Bin is still a top value, offering slightly pungent, sweaty aromas but flavors of stone fruit accented by grassy-herbal notes. There's ample weight without heaviness and a zesty, fresh finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"Gentle notes of creaminess and ripe pears signal a soft, creamy wine with lots of texture and body. The rounded body carries some weight and is edged with a bitter marzipan note. All this is countered by fresh acidity, more creamy, nutty notes and a vanilla finish.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"This 100% Sangiovese opens with pretty aromas of iris, violet, dark berry and a blend of cooking spices. On the palate, ground black pepper, anise and espresso accent a core of dried black cherry while tightly knit, assertive tannins provide backup. Drink 2017–2022.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese

The palate holds a decent amount of black fruit, but with a green, underripe vein and fairly high level of acidity and tannins.",US-Virginia:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Rich and opulent, this is a big fruity, toasty white wine. The vanilla from the wood combines with ripe peach and pineapple flavors, the acidity a hint of tangerine zest. While it is definitely full-bodied, both the full fruit and the acidity give it  very drinkable balance.",Portugal-Dão:Portuguese White

"Normally a blending wine, because on its own this varietal offers sweetness and frangrance without accompanying body and depth, and this wine shows why. ItÕs pretty as a picture, with black raspberry flavors and soft tannins, but it seems to need a center of gravity, especially at this price.",US-California:Cabernet Franc

"Rich, rounded wine showing delicious sweet pear and apricot flavors with a touch of white fig. Well balanced.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay

This bottling offers plump strawberry and blackberry aromas, with savory soy and turned earth touches. The palate leads with Concord grape flavor, while pepper, oregano and coffee bean elements keep it complex.",US-California:Carignane
"Black-fruit aromas are matched and ultimately outweighed by oak-based chocolate and vanilla. This feels grabby and rubbery, with oaky flavors of plum, raspberry and vanilla. A creamy, resiny finish with chocolate and spice flavors wraps things up.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley:Syrah
"Smooth and oily in texture, this is round and full of pear juice flavor. There is just a touch of green legume, adding piquancy to this ripe wine. Screwcap.",Portugal-Lisboa:Arinto
"Smooth and velvety, with chocolate-cherry flavors, but the sweetness tails off quickly, disappointing the palate. Good and sound, but lacks the continuing richness you want in a true Port-style wine, especially at this price.",US-California:Port

"Very dry and raisiny-pruney, a harsh, somewhat bitter wine. The dryness is relieved by some ripely sweet blackberries that show up in the middle palate.",US-California:Malbec
"The aromas bring notes of cocoa, green herb and purple fruit, seeming more evolved than its age might indicate, while also bringing along some volatility. The palate shows gamy fruit flavors that seem a bit dried out.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A fine value in Northern Rhône Syrah, the Tain cooperative's 2009 Crozes-Hermitage is fairly extracted for a Crozes, with plummy, dark fruit alongside hints of clove, leather and coffee. Turns a bit astringent on the finish; try 2013–2018.",France-Rhône Valley:Syrah
"Pale in color, this wine offers appealing, very varietal aromas of strawberry, cherry, sarsaparilla and coffee. It's quite elegant in style with strawberry and cinnamon flavors that show persistence.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"The ultimate patio/terrace wine has been found, and it's Urban from O. Fournier. True as can be, with lychee, acacia and green melon aromas and flavors, this wine is plump but refreshing, with honest Cafayate character. Maybe the best under-$10 white wine being made in Argentina.",Argentina-Other:Torrontés
"Dark in color, this wine is firm, structured and dense. Ripe blackberry fruits dominate the tannins, giving weight and impressive richness for the vintage. The wood-aging is still showing in the dry core, so the wine needs to age. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine offers berries, black currants and just a hint of greenness. It has fruitiness and a dry structure, just not the weight of the vintage.",Portugal-Port:Port
"Gritty cassis aromas are oaky and challenging, which is what you can get when a wine spends more than three years in oak. In the mouth, this is wiry and rubbery. Foxy plum and cherry flavors finish clampy and herbal. Very good but with a few holes and pitfalls.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"Notes of fresh honeysuckle, baking soda and shaved citron mix with tons of slate, gravel and wet rocks on the nose of this great bottling. There's the slightest touch of sweetness to the palate, where waves of vibrant acidity carry forth flavors of orange blossom and mandarin as well as a grapefruit peel twist. It's certainly drinkable now, but will mature and evolve well through 2034.",US-California:Riesling
"Fresh wheat finds its way on the nose of this nicely made wine, followed by a depth of lemon and quince. Medium-bodied and weighty, it's also bright in acidity and succulent, with another dose of floral beauty on the finish.",US-California:Viognier

"Produced mainly from Merlot with only 10% of Cabernet Sauvignon, this fat, juicy wine has red-berry flavors that are supported by dry tannins that are in the process of softening. Notes from the wood-aging also need to integrate. Drink from late 2016.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This Aglianico from Irpinia is thin in appearance and offers awkward notes of apple cider, black mineral, cherry, blueberry and spice. The nose is a bit muddled but the wine drinks well thanks to its solid structure and polished tannins.",Italy-Southern Italy:Aglianico
"The cellar of this estate once became a secluded meeting place for lovers, bringing about the name of the wine. This is a mature wine, showing how well Muscadet can develop. Aged for two years on its lees, it has richness as well as plenty of remaining fresh apple fruit. Now at its peak, the wine is ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley:Melon
"Big indeed, this is very dark and concentrated, with fruit-powered flavors wrapped in sweet baking spices. An impressive Petite Sirah that does not seem too tannic; the barrel flavors—vanilla, cinnamon, brown sugar—more than compensate, and the fruit is round and ripe enough to hold the focus.",US-Washington:Petite Sirah
"Dry and tannic, this has adequate blackberry, currant and oak flavors.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Creamy aromas predominate on the nose and carry through to a round, rich palate. This is generous, full and bready, with a lot of earthy flavors on the midpalate. While there is balance, there is little fruit and lots of yeasty character.",France-Alsace:Sparkling Blend
"Aromas of horse stall and barnyard precede a funky palate that displays bitter, charred sensations but no fruit richness.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Grillo
"Scents of violets and savory herbs add complexity to tart, juicy red cherries and plums on this crisp, elegantly framed Cabernet Franc. A touch of menthol highlights a cool, acidic edge on the palate. Finishes moderately long with a murmur of fine-grained tannins.",US-New York:Cabernet Franc
Basic aromas of fruity Chiclets gum introduce a palate with low acidity and a sense of weight and friction. This plump rosé tastes of spiced melon. The finish is low on verve and thus prematurely soft. Drink immediately for best results.,Spain-Northern Spain:Rosé
"This rosé is slightly confected on the nose, but boasts ample weight and richness on the palate, along with appealing notes of raspberry, white chocolate and citrus.",France-Rhône Valley:Rosé
"Attractively juicy fruit is fresh and full of black currant flavors. This wine still has firm tannins although they are beginning to fill out with fresh fruitiness and smoky acidity. It should still age, so drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Made with Nero d'Avola and other grapes, all bush-trained, this opens with subdued aromas of dark berry and toast. The dense palate offers dried blackberry, oak-driven spice and a chocolate note alongside firm tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the fruit flavors.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Red Blend
"With a dusty core of black plum, cassis and clove, this is a straightforward, softly approachable wine made to be enjoyed now. Medium bodied, it enters into a realm of creamy vanilla on the finish.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A strong pineapple and mango imprint persists throughout this Chardonnay, along with bright acidity and a floral finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Meaty and savory with balsamic notes, it will need hearty food to tone its wildness and size. At 15.4% from a great vineyard, there's heat on the finish, that again food might tame.",US-California:Barbera
"Red currant and fresh strawberry make for an enticing, inviting nose and carry on to the frothy, dry, slender palate. This is an easy, refreshing but wonderfully clean and fruity pink fizz.",France-Alsace:Sparkling Blend
"This big, ripe wine is now past its youth. That is bringing out the toast, yeast and walnut flavors. But the acidity is not far away, coming from the taut texture, and leaving a crisp fresh, raspberry-flavored aftertaste.",France-Loire Valley:Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay
"Opens with aromas of oak, mint, and herbs, with a hint of blackcurrant. Drinks fairly tannic at the moment, and sharp in acids. There is some berry fruit buried down deep, but not offering a plush, hedonistic experience. The finish is very dry and tannic.",US-California:Meritage
"Three years of barrel ageing lends an intoxicating flair to this lushly textured Cabernet Franc. Rich vanilla and spice notes are unabashedly oaky, but the palate is concentrated with black cherry and cassis flavors, elegantly framed with brisk acidity and soft, velvety tannins.",US-New York:Cabernet Franc
"Dark colored wine, revealing wood aging both aromatically and to taste. That said, it also has great weight, a powerful and complex wine with its coffee, dried fruit and black plum flavors. It's an impressive, solid wine that deserves at least seven years' aging.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This attractive wine is so drinkable, fresh and fruity. Its edge of texture gives it more than just simple fruitiness, while acidity adds just the right boost and liveliness. Red currants, tangerines and lemon peel are there to finish.",France-Provence:Rosé
"Tannins and structure bring out the character of the 2010 vintage in this open, generally soft wine. It is already attractive, drinkable and fresh. Black currants dominate the natural fruitiness. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This 11-vineyard blend of 51% Syrah, 31% Grenache, 14% Mourvèdre and 4% Counoise represents an excellent value in the realm of expertly balanced but boisterously flavored wines. The fruity nose shows smashed raspberry, boysenberry, violet and potpourri, leading into a lively palate full of rose petals, exotic red cherries and turned earth. It's easy to drink yet intellectual as well.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Soft and ripe, with the warmth of a full, fruity Alentejano wine, this is generous and ready to drink. Red fruits are lifted by acidity, while flavors of wood aging and spice add an extra dimension. Drink now and until 2019.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"Fruity and rustic, this blend of Zin and other grape varieties has forward berry, cherry, currant, mint and spice flavors. Fully dry, it has an everyday quality that suggests sandwiches, chicken and simple Italian fare.",US-California:Red Blend
"Acacia flower, toasted hazelnut and Bartlett pear aromas take shape in the glass. The palate delivers stone fruit, citrus zest and mineral alongside bright acidity.",Italy-Southern Italy:Fiano
"Stony aromas of green melon and apple are mellow and classy. This is fresh on the palate, with a burst of acidity to brighten things up. Flavors of citrus fruits, green apple, nectarine and stony minerality finish similarly.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño
"Viognier represents 60% of the blend, unusual for the Southern Rhône, and it imparts white pepper and ginger to the bouquet, a broad, oily texture, and bold apricot flavor. The balance is 30% Clairette and 10% Grenache, but those varieties play only supporting roles. The spice notes integrate nicely into the wine with airing, but the wine does finish a bit short.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style White Blend
"This red blend is nicely dry, with abundant of dark plum and pomegranate flavors and a full-bodied, moderately tannic mouthfeel. It's easy to drink but bold enough to pair with hearty proteins.",US-California:Red Blend

"Golden and restrained, this wine does not give too much away on the nose. But the spicily soft palate delivers with a brilliant, lemon-zesty acidity well couched in mineral midpalate concentration with an enduring finish.",Austria-Kamptal:Riesling
"This is a big, mouthfilling Cabernet, rich and voluptuous in fruit. Although it's a bit hot in alcohol, you hardly notice it, with the explosion of blackberries, raisins and chocolate-covered cherries, made even richer by smoky-sweet oak. Delicious now and through 2014.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This bottling from the Beckett brothers—bolstered with 14% Syrah—is yet another crowd-pleaser from their stylish, affordable label. Plump black-fruit aromas meet iodine and dried purple-flower notes on the nose. The palate is rich and soft at first, growing tannic over time, with dark purple-fruit flavors that last long into the finish, edged in bright acidity.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"A pretty pale peach color, the strawberry aromas are quite light while the flavors are tart and spritely. It piques the interest.",US-Washington:Rosé
"Sweet, soft and simple, with medicinal flavors of cherries and oak.",US-California:Merlot
"This delightful, off-dry white is a blend of Pinot Gris, Gewürztraminer, Müller Thurgau, Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling,  perfectly matched to deliver crisp, fruity aromatics and flavors of apples, oranges and pears. It's a terrific anytime quaffer.",US-Oregon:White Blend

"High quality and easy availability (more than 17,000 cases are made) make this Brunello a sure bet for consumers who love the rich tastes of Tuscany. The wine boasts an immediate and intense delivery of blackberry, cedar and pressed blue flowers. It has natural denseness and firmness that fuel a long and satisfying finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Cut grass, tomato vine and gooseberry aromas lead the way on this zesty white. Racy acidity underscores grapefruit, kiwi and a hint of green bell pepper while a mineral note invigorates the finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon
"This is not only one of the best Syrahs of the vintage, it's easily the greatest Syrah ever produced from Sonoma Valley. Stuns with its soft,  complex, black and blue berry, teriaki beef, black pepper and sandalwood flavors. The depth is unbelievable, the length impressive. Clearly a first growth Syrah, and should develop bottle complexity for the next six years, if not longer.",US-California:Syrah
"A bit sharp and rubbery at first, with herbal, floral, berry aromas rising up in due time. The palate is a little rigid, with angular acidity and semitart raspberry and red currant flavors. Lightly toasted on the finish even if there's not much oak on this regular, competent CS.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a young but excellent gran reserva, so it's gritty-smelling in its youth, with aromas of blackberry and cassis. Racy acidity pushes the focus on the palate towards the upper tier, while flavors of lactic oak, lemon peel, tobacco and mocha share the stage with plum and berry fruit. Finishing flavors of vanilla and raw oak are supported by good acidity and just enough pulp. Drink through 2030.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"This is a really fruity rosé with refreshing red currant and raspberry fruit flavors. They are blended with a crisp, dusty texture that offers both an herbaceous and a fuller character. The extra richness makes this a food rosé.",France-Loire Valley:Rosé
"A hint of rose petal perfumes white peach and grapefruit on this elegant off-dry Riesling. The midpalate is softened by a burst of luscious apricot, while a zesty steak of lime balances a long, meandering finish.",US-New York:Riesling
"Rubbery berry and plum aromas come with a note of latex. In the mouth, this is juicy, bright and focused, with good raspberry and plum fruit. Textural balance is an attribute, while the finish is round, lively and full of tasty berry flavors. Drink through 2018.",Spain-Catalonia:Red Blend
A gentle wine with open and generous soft berry fruits showing through dusty tannins and lively acidity. This is likely to develop relatively fast into a delicious wine.,France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"This is a creamy and opulent oak-aged white blend from Tuscany (with equal parts Traminer, Riesling and Chardonnay) that opens with a luminous golden color and delicious aromas of exotic fruit, pineapple, yellow rose and melted butter. The wine is rich and dense with enormous intensity on the finish. Pair it with lobster, white meat or saffron risotto.",Italy-Tuscany:White Blend
"There is plenty of ripe fruit here, the richness of 2005 evident. The flavors are of ripe blackberry jam, red plums and a strong structure of sweet tannins. There is a fresh, acidity-driven juicy lift on the finish.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A dark, roasted, smoky opening is the greeting on this burly Tempranillo from Zamora. Grabbing tannins pinch like squeaky rubbery, while this tastes of savory, roasted black fruits. A meaty, chewy, tannic finish is confirmation of overall toughness. Drink through 2021.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"This exuberant wine has pineapple, pepper and perfumed toast. It is open, generous, kept in check with some crisp acidity, but essentially rich, lively and buttery. This is a down-to-earth wine, fat, prosperous and friendly.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This is rich and dry in blackberries, licorice, bacon, sweet oak and peppery spices. It shows lots of acidity and tannins, giving it a firm structure. Give it a brief decant and drink now.",US-California:Syrah
"The very inviting nose on this offering combines boysenberry and peppercorn with richer aromas of baked goods sprinkled with mocha, vanilla and caramel. There is a refreshing tartness to the palate and edgy firm tannins presenting black-plum-skin and brioche flavors. It needs a little more time in the bottle.",US-California:Syrah
"Zesty acidity shines a spotlight on fresh citrus and mineral tones in this blend of Riesling and Gewürztraminer. It's not deeply concentrated on the palate, but a kiss of white blossom lends elegance to the finish.",US-New York:White Blend
"Very stony and chalky sea-shell aromas arise off of this bottling that also benefits from lemon curd and plump Anjou-pear fruit on the edges. A tingling acidity and steely structure frames the palate, where delicate flavors of Key lime and more lemon curd add depth to the tension.",US-California:Chardonnay
"A 100% varietal wine, this offers a juiciness of red fruit that's deliciously inviting, surrounded by plenty of cinnamon and black pepper. Grippy and full bodied, it reins in its ripeness well, remaining structured and complex through a mineral-driven finish.",US-California:Zinfandel
"A whiff of leather introduces a wine with a strong savory character; the leather and earth flavors start to bury the sweet berry fruit, and the tannins take on a chalky texture.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"The word massive barely begins to describe this Cabernet Sauvignon. It aims to compete with anything from Napa Valley, and does so largely successfully. The palate offers waves of ripe blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. What's harder to put into words is the elegance and balance. Despite its serious heft, the wine feels comfortable in the mouth. Indisputably an ager, it should begin to mellow after 2018, and continue to offer pleasure for many years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Maduro cigars, cedar, beef char and pipe ash highlight the nose on this blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Cabernet Franc and 20% Merlot from a longtime producer. It's relatively lean and light on the palate, with black peppercorns and roasted pork elements. The Cab Franc shows strongly.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a hearty coming-together of Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Syrah and Petite Sirah. It dances in baked plum and raisin as a tartness of cherry and savory dried herb counterbalances the rich ripeness and sizable tannin.",US-California:Red Blend
"While there are plenty of firm tannins and weight here, the wine does feel somewhat hollow. The red fruits are there, showing slowly against the tannins. It has fine final acidity, but not the power and concentration you should expect.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"This isn't the biggest, baddest Cabernet. Instead, it's more of a charmer—lithe and crisp. Cherries and dried herbs on the nose add hints of earth and pepper on the palate, then finish with a gentle wash of dusty tannins. Drink now–2018.",Australia-South Australia:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of French oak, coconut, exotic spice and plum take shape in the glass. The chewy palate doles out mature cherry, blackberry extract, oak-driven spice and licorice. Solid, fine-grained tannins leave a firm, mouth-puckering finish.",Italy-Central Italy:Montepulciano
"This bubblegum-like Merlot has candied red-currant, vanilla and white sugar flavors. The acidity seems harsh.",US-California:Merlot
"Dried herb notes lend a savory complexity to delicate berry and stone-fruit aromas on this dainty, dancing Riesling. It's brisk and lean on the palate, with a piercing lemon acidity that cuts through flavors of ripe citrus and stone fruit.",Germany-Rheingau:Riesling
"As always with Morgan's Pinot Gris, the 2009 is bone dry and ultracrisp in acidity, with mouthwatering citrus, apricot and green apple flavors. Great as a cocktail sipper, especially with shrimp cocktail.",US-California:Pinot Gris
"This wine's lovely rose petal and strawberry aromas, along with other tart and tangy wild berry notes, gather with appealing weight and length. It's quite dry and finishes on a lively dash of white pepper.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Malbec, Merlot and Petit Verdot are included in this wine that's black-purple in color, with a thick density to its dusty black fruit. Cedar, tar and tobacco weave in between blackberry and currant, finishing in a powerful grip of tannin.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"It's good to see a wine in that increasingly rare sight: a Provence skittle-shaped bottle. This is a light and fruity wine from vineyards on the Massif des Maures, close to the sea. It has a bright crisp aftertaste with plenty of acidity to keep it all very crisp. Skittles is the precursor to lawn and indoor bowling.",France-Provence:Rosé
"A rich and fruity wine with an attractive layer of tannins to go with the bright red cherry and damson flavors. The fruit is delicious, succulent, finishing with fine acidity.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Waxy, honeyed aromas of melon and white flowers lead to a plump, leesy, creamy but balanced palate full of bready notes, stone-fruit flavors and vanilla. Another wave of leesy vanilla, melon, tropical fruit and cream takes over the finish. This contains Viognier, Garnacha Blanca and Chenin Blanc, a small portion of which was barrel fermented.",Spain-Catalonia:White Blend
"This is a simple, easy-drinking Pinot for drinking now. It tastes like a juicy blend of cherries, pomegranates and cola, with just enough acidity for balance.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Nose and palate are full of juicy, rose-scented plums. A good dose of sweetness boosts those flavors even more, but fails to create overall balance. This is rather rich and full bodied.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"Charred-earth, espresso, French oak and menthol aromas unfold on this full-bodied red while a plum note lingers in the background. The subdued palate is rather evolved, showing raisin, toast, spirits and licorice but not much fruit richness. Assertive, close grained tannins provide the bracing framework.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Fausoni is a rich and opulent Barbaresco that presents a veritable wall of flavors that surrounds you on all sides: Vanilla, sweet cherry and chocolate are the most obvious aromas, but Indian spice and black currants also make an appearance. Awesome intensity is followed by firm structure. Drink after 2015.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"This is a style of wine that offers a blockbuster view of Bordeaux. It is full of dark extracted fruits, brooding tannins, dark plum juice and a burnt feeling that comes from alcohol. In its style, it goes for excess.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Costalupo is a fun blend of Trebbiano, Passerina and Chardonnay that offers fresh aromas of lemon zest, spice, ripe apple and pear flavors. It has a creamy texture and crisp acidity that would make a nice match for rich seafood dishes.",Italy-Central Italy:White Blend
"Classic spice and lychee aromas lead to a wine that is medium sweet, attractive but one-dimensional. It has perfumed, candy shop flavors, almost exaggerated. Screwcap.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"Not only is this a great bottling at a judicious price, but it also shows a great deal of nuance from the appellation that often brings mostly power. Blackberry, beef, smoked game and pencil shavings show on the nose. The palate brings bright hibiscus and tart elderberry as well as graphite, thyme and bay-leaf flavors.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Although certainly sweet, this wine is much more than that. Alongside the honey and syrup flavors are intensely bright pineapple flavors and lively acidity. It's the balance of this wine that is so impressive, with all the elements properly in place. Drink now and until 2020.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"This blend of many vineyard lots seems less than the sum of its parts. Pungently herbal with characteristic Oregon tomato leaf tannins, its fruit remains hidden beneath the tannins. Age may enhance its beauty, but for the moment it remains tight and unyielding, with suggestions of heat around the cranberry/pomegranate fruit.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This bottling packs in all that the grape can be: honeydew melon ripeness, crushed chalk and slate minerality and a grassy edge. The palate shows a citrus rind pithiness, some sea salt and a lime zest freshness. Classic and uncomplicated.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Syrupy and dense, this is a burly wine, soft but powerful, that keeps coming back to the theme of blackberry syrup. Velvety tannins buoy the midpoint, before it finishes in a burst of intense ripeness.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Smoky and intense from the get-go, this saturated, black-as-night Malbec is full of blackberry, cassis and gamy aromas. While it goes heavy on the gas, the wine's structure is up to it. Flavors of chocolate, burnt toast, salt and blackberry finish toasty and long, with savory blackened spice notes. Drink through 2023.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Jammy aromas of plum and berry are oaky and come with a hint of rubber and/or latex. This is weighty yet balanced. Earthy flavors of baked black fruits, tea and spice are slightly minerally, while the finish is oaky and generous, with a touch of menthol and heat.",Spain-Northern Spain:Mencía
"Young and stiff upon being opened, this is striated with flavors and scents of earthy beet, rhubard, raspberry and strawberry. The palate brings in accents of iron filings, mushroom and further complexity. It's a sturdy, medium-weight, earthy wine, with moderate aging potention. Drink now through 2023.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Herbal and briary on the nose, with green aromas of oregano and sage. Feels rather lean and abrasive, with high acidity and minty flavors of herbal plum and pie cherry. Tight, hot and spicy on the finish.",Chile-Curicó Valley:Carmenère
"A foundation of truffled earth and forest floor give this a rustic edge, complemented by savory herb and black tea. Weighty, it shows its backbone of oak aging well, finishing abruptly in cranberry and dark cherry.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"An appealing Cab Franc, among the better versions of the variety. Shows the weight and structure of a fine Napa Cabernet Sauvignon, except the flavors veer toward red cherries and red cherry liqueur. Drink now, with honey-baked ham.",US-California:Cabernet Franc
"This is an interesting wine that pushes the boundaries beyond the usual offerings in California. Blended from Viognier, Vermentino, Verdelho and Sauvignon Blanc, it's dry, tart and complex, with a broad range of citrus, white peach, dried apricot and white pepper flavors. Don't serve it too cold.",US-California:White Blend
"Spunky aromas of red plum and red-berry fruits are fresh. This wine feels dry, chalky and tannic. Berry and plum flavors come with a hint of chocolate and spice on a choppy finish.",Spain-Central Spain:Red Blend
"A touch of exotic spice gives a musky appeal to the ripe lychee and rose petal notes. Lush, languid and semisweet, the palate has a dense, concentrated pink-grapefruit flavor and soft, lemony acidity that lingers on the palate.",US-New York:Gewürztraminer
"This big, spicy wine is very smooth and rich now, but also has the potential to age. Dusty tannins, perfumed fruits and a rich dense character offer the potential to drink in a year. This is a great expression of Cahors.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"Ripe and structured, this has black plum and ripe berry flavors that are lifted by the acidity typical of the vintage. Tannins are solid and dense, packed around the fruit, and show that the wine is still young. Drink this solid while fruity wine from 2020.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
This is a soft wine although one with a tangy backdrop that makes it both smooth and crisp. Its citrus fruitiness has a touch of pepper as well as minerality. The elements have come together into a bright tangy wine to drink now.,France-Loire Valley:Melon
"This is a beautiful wine that exhibits seductively dark concentration and bright aromas of red berries, cola and licorice that are characteristic of the Nebbiolo grape. The tannins show a polished, silky nature and will continue to evolve over long years of cellar aging.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Ripe, rooty aromas of licorice, leather and peanut are matched by cedar, tobacco and other complex scents. This mature Cafayate classic is still rugged and solid on the palate despite showing a rusting color. Flavors of chocolate, prune and baking spices finish deep, with rooty, chocolaty notes and pent-up energy. Drink now.",Argentina-Other:Malbec
"Despite showing gritty, scratchy aromas of baked, earthy black fruits, this Carignan-led blend is rock solid and ready. Tight, punchy, focused acidity sets up a rustic palate with a mix of baked-fruit flavors, spice and char. A toasty, dark, long finish is staunch and sturdy. Drink through 2016.",Chile-Maule Valley:Red Blend
"This has an unusually dark color. Aromas of blackberry jam and maple syrup are followed by equally rich, deep and expressive flavors. The remarkable concentration of ripe berry flavors layered densely with fine tannins is at least partly due to blending in Petite Sirah. It adds up to a full bodied and delicious wine.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Grapes from the vines around the 13th-century castle of La Bastide are sent to the Marmandais co-op for a separate bottling. This smooth and ripe wine shows plenty of rich mango and apricot flavors cut by lime acidity that gives a lift of freshness. Drink now, although the wine will age until 2018.",France-Southwest France:Sauvignon Blanc
"A Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wine, which reveals great structure to go with its black berry fruits. American Daren Miller, married to a Bordeaux native, has been involved in the restoration of this property in the Médoc, producing a classic wine, that pays great respect to its origins.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Very big, very dry and powerful, a Pinot that explodes with lush cherry jam, red currant, chocolate and spice flavors wrapped into a tannic and frankly acidic young wine. If you pop the cork now, give it a good decant.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Light salmon in color, this has aromas of pineapple, passion fruit and tangerine. It feels tangy and zesty, with pithy, crisp flavors of citrus fruits and red berries. It's juicy, but not overly flavorful on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain:Rosé
"Mature berry, toast, espresso, fennel and a balsamic note lead the nose. The firm palate doles out Morello cherry, raspberry jam, powdered sage and white pepper framed in assertive, fine-grained tannins.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"The nose is initially shy but eventually reveals aromas of black-skinned berry, blue flower and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub. The straightforward, easygoing palate offers juicy black cherry and a peppery note alongside round tannins. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy soon.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nero d'Avola
"Barrel aromas of toast and char are at the fore, followed by black fruit, graphite and spice. The palate is full bodied with ripe, generous dark-fruit flavors. The oak seems a bit heavy handed but there are lots of good things going on.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This ode-to-the laborers twist-top bottling is a solid sipper, with aromas of turned earth and black slate giving depth to black cherry and blueberry fruits that sit atop a mole sauce made from chocolate and dried bell peppers. The palate offers more dark fruit, chocolate and lava rocks, set amidst fine-grained tannins.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Hard, acrid and sweaty smelling, with a plump but dilute-feeling palate that shows flavors of bitter peach pit, white grapefruit and citrus. Hard and bitter on the finish. Harmony is questionable; overall quality is sketchy.",Chile-Maule Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Fragrant yellow and purple flowers on the nose and palate of this medium-sweet Riesling add a subtle perfume to all of the ripe, luscious white-peach and nectarine flavors. Hints of wet stone and lime-like acidity lend a crisp, tonic tone to the midpalate, extending onto the long, lingering finish.",US-New York:Riesling
"Structured wine with 30% of Cabernet to give shape to the very ripe Merlot. The wine has both acidity, some firm tannins and a concentrated, dry core. It's likely to age well over 3–4 years.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Tropical on the nose with lots of melon, guava and pineapple, this is reminiscent of fruit cocktail on both the nose and palate. Despite it's juicy profile, however, it lacks in intensity, but a clean minerality and bright, citrusy acidity keep it refreshing.",US-New York:Sauvignon Blanc
"Lightweight and lacking in texture, this wine offers fading red-cherry fruit, cola notes and leafy greens. Drink up.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Pinot Noir
"This new vintage of Abeja's estate-grown Viognier is back to a richer mouthfeel after the high acid 2008, with generous citrus and stone fruits—peach and pear—candied lemon and pineapple, highlighted with cinnamon spice. Flat out yummy, roundly fruity, and long-lasting, with butterscotch ruling the finish.",US-Washington:Viognier
"Eola Hills Pinots often offer this sort of interesting flavors—a mix of earth, herb and forest; the red fruit is tart and the tannins hard. A wine to cellar, it already shows depth and penetration, with a darker, smoky streak in the finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"A pure expression of Vermentino, this offers aromas of citrus, peach, dried hay and Golden Delicious apple. Pair this bright white with Thai dishes or spicy Indian food.",Italy-Tuscany:Vermentino
"Fruity and juicy, this is an attractive blend of Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc, giving a tight, mineral-driven wine. With its pink grapefruit and crisp green apple fruits, it is young and can age, although not for long. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This rounded wine adds richness to its herbaceous character. Apple and quince flavors are razor-sharp in freshness, bright and deliciously lively. Drink now.",France-France Other:Sauvignon Blanc
"Rich, velvety blackberry and cherry flavors flood the palate of this decadently full-bodied Cabernet Franc. It's irresistibly juicy and forward, but invigorating acidity and shades of herb, bramble and fine-grained tannins lend depth and structure. The finish is languid and luscious.",US-New York:Cabernet Franc
"A deep color, oaky aromas and ripe dark-fruit flavors give a sense of richness and breadth to this full-bodied wine. It's dry and smooth on the palate, with a warm spicy finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Aromas of pure black fruit, slightly burned toast, concentrated plum, black cherries and a touch of espresso show on this study of a rarely standalone grape. The palate is firm with chewy tannins yet approachable in flavors, offering dried elderberries, coffee beans, burned caramel flavors.",US-California:Petit Verdot
"A consistent stunner vintage after vintage, this elevated Cabernet is velvety smooth and exotically laced in coconut, cola and clove. Mouthfilling and succulent, it's high-toned in approach and balance, despite a fierce concentration of black fruit. The highlights are vanilla, clove and dried herb.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made with 85% Sangiovese and 15% Merlot, this has a shy nose, eventually revealing whiffs of black-skinned fruit and scorched earth. The subdued rather evolved palate suggests dried black cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside mellow tannins. Drink soon to capture the remaining freshness.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Here's a smoky, oak-driven wine with a nice balance between spice and aromas that recall blackberry, plum and mature cherry. As the wine evolves in the glass, it exhibits chocolate and espresso bean. It's dense and thick, with firm tannins that give it staying power.",Italy-Central Italy:Montepulciano
"Dry and harsh, almost old-fashioned in its tannic astringency, with a green kick of mint. Relieved by a streak of black cherries and cedar. Drink now.",US-California:Merlot
"The pretty fragrance comes with cotton candy highlights, along with a note of tangy red fruit. It's concentrated and deep, with appealing purity of flavor and the structure to age for over a decade.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"The wine is crisp and shot through with acidity. That gives the black-currant fruit great intensity as well as a juicy character. The wine needs to calm down, so wait until 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Chunky aromas of murky red-berry fruits, pie cherry and briny oak struggle to impress. This feels saucy and resiny, while briny, oaky, citric flavors finish scattered and hot. Overall, this woody rosado isn't shining.",Spain-Northern Spain:Rosado
"This is modeled on southern Rhône blends—a fairly straightforward mix of 85% Syrah and 15% Grenache. Grainy and smoky, with a slight charred aspect, this focused effort displays deep pomegranate fruit, soaked in soy, balsamic and other umami notes.",US-Washington:Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is a good wine, but it relies too much on oak, overwhelming it with buttered toast and caramel. The result is a rich but unbalanced wine, with underlying orange, pineapple and peach flavors.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This is an excellent Riserva metodo classico sparkling wine from northern Italy with a full, creamy consistency. Made with 100% Chardonnay, the wine boasts deep layers of stone fruit, yeast, honey and almond nut.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Chardonnay
"90-92. Barrel sample. This has some weight and richness, with chunky fruit and sweet tannins. This wine is concentrated and very firm.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Produced from 30-year-old vines, this 55% Cabernet Sauvignon wine is firm with tannins as well as black-currant fruit. It is balanced with the potential to become a fruity wine with a soft texture. The acidity will keep it crisp and on point. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"An intriguing waxy character shows strongly on the nose of this bottling, with ripe lime and green-apple aromas as well. The flavors are light and delicate, with a touch of pomelo that grows with patience into more tropical yet still restrained papaya and bubblegum elements.",US-California:Viognier
"Fresh toast, wooded spice  on the nose is friendly and appealing. On the palate, it works too, with its playful balance of layered spice oak and fresh acidity. The wine will appeal to fans of both oaked and unoaked Chardonnay, and will make a nice addition to the table.",US-New York:Chardonnay
"This blend of Barbera, Petite Sirah and other red varieties tastes hearty, fruity, full flavored and full bodied, without being too tannic to enjoy easily. Aromas like blackberry jam and flavors reminiscent of dark plum and spicy, smoky oak make it tempting and delicious. Enough fresh acidity keeps it balanced.",US-California:Red Blend
"Absolutely opaque—it's definitely one of the darkest, inkiest wines out there. The black-currant nose shows lots of depth, with vanilla and cinnamon shadings. Though it is massive and a bit unpenetrable now, the softness, blackberry fruit and full tannins suggest it will be really nice in a few years. Just expect a real fruit ball.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This delicious and velvety expression of Nero d'Avola opens with aromas of earth, ripe black berry, leather and clove. The juicy palate offers blackberry pulp and ripe blueberry, accented by a note of unsweetened black licorice.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nero d'Avola
"This is largely Viognier from the Southern Rhône, and that's reflected in its aromas of honey and pineapple. The flavors are fresh and slightly herbal, but based in melon and pineapple. It's medium in body, then finishes on a mouthwatering citrus note.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style White Blend
"Fresh red cherries, strawberries and cranberry greet the nose on this widely available wine that also shows mocha and charred chaparral. The palate is lively and also boasts some decent tannins, offering flavors of plum and pomegranate juice, crushed marjoram and licorice.",US-California:Merlot
"A wine with only natural sulfur, it feels lean, with piercing acidity and firm tannins. It is young and all the elements should fall into place, but with the fruit's stalky character the wine will always be dry.",France-France Other:Red Blend
"Green apple notes give way to grapefruit and melon, but tart lime and green apple flavors power this wine.",Portugal-Vinho Verde:Loureiro
"Judicious use of oak makes Keuka Spring stand out in a line-up of Finger Lakes Chards. Subtle on the nose with whiffs of fresh apple and toasted hazelnuts, the wine's palate is quite full with luscious sweet melon, vanilla and cream. Hints of smoke and burnt sugar add a dimension of darkness to the finish.",US-New York:Chardonnay
"Always a bit herbaceous, this year the underlying leanness shows in rather green fruit, veering into bell pepper, dill, mint and oregano. All the oak in France and America can't really make the fruit any riper. But the oak does add smoky, creamy, vanilla notes and sweetness, too. There is some pretty fruit—notably blackberry—in the finish, but still, this is a wine of structure. It's fantastically well made, a classy quaff, and it will pair well with rich red meats, especially beef.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The treatment here is fermentation in stainless steel, and the wine shows ripe, tart, tangy fruit. Mostly melon and kiwi flavors, good weight on the palate, and little if any oak.",US-Oregon:Pinot Gris
"Juicy and jammy, this wine features sweet blackberry and cherry fruit, with a touch of smoky oak. The texture is a bit coarse, but a good broiled steak will wrestle those tannins into submission.",US-California:Meritage
"This is a concentrated wine that is packed with black fruits. The tannins are a support to the rich juicy flavor and the fine acidity. Coming from vineyards on the plateau to the north of the Douro river, the wine has a cool edge of freshness at the end.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
Drying mineral tones are backed by stone fruit and chamomile to shape a linear and tonic Prosecco Brut with bright acidity and lively effervescence. The wine would pair well with pasta salad and appetizers.,Italy-Veneto:Prosecco
"This is a very fine wine with sweetness tempered with a great sense of structure and concentration. Lychees dominate the fruit profile but are supplemented with pineapple and pomelo flavors that are sprinkled with pepper. It is rich and full in the mouth. It needs some more time to age, so drink from 2016.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"Just-squeezed lime mixes with soda for a light, refreshing aroma on this wine from the longtime Sauv Blanc producer in the middle of the Santa Ynez Valley. The palate is all citrus, with lime sorbet and lemon-pith flavors.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Sauvignon Blanc has long been the winery's calling card, but this vintage isn't quite up to past standards. Some high-toned scents add edginess to the tropical fruit, and some bitter skin flavors are borderline too much. Good, but they can do better.",US-Washington:Sauvignon Blanc
"This is undeniably an oaky wine with a prominent layer of buttered toast and butterscotch, but the underlying orange, guava and lime flavors are pristine.",US-California:Chardonnay
"While very fruity, fresh and ripe tasting, this medium-bodied wine also has good acidity for balance. Light touches of vanilla, butter and nutmeg add welcome complexity.",US-California:Viognier
"Raspberry crumble immediately comes to mind in this vineyard-designate, a luxuriously built, big-bodied expression of a warm, easy vintage. A nose of violet keeps it from getting overly rambunctious around the heartier aspects of cranberry, crushed rose petals and cherry cola.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This blend of Merlot, Tannat and Syrah is soft, fruity and very tasty. It has a juicy character, its red berries lightly enveloped by some dry tannins. Acidity cuts through the wine, giving a lifted character that is ready to drink now.",France-France Other:Red Blend
"A lot of wood, still pretty rough, surrounds a thick, tannic, muscular, ripe, rustic, Old World-style Zin. There's nothing elegant about this wine, but it packs a lot of flavor into a sturdy frame.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This is great Sancerre from the Monts Damnés vineyard. It shows all the right varietal character, stylized by initial austerity, flint and a dense texture. Gradually it opens up to show a balance of acidity and richness.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"This has aromas of toast and exotic fruit that carry over to the palate along with notes of citrus zest, vanilla and roasted coffee bean. A hint of grilled herb marks the close.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon
"Made in tiny amounts, this wine blends 72% Mourvèdre with field-blended Petite Sirah, Syrah, Peloursin, Carignane and Alicante Bouschet. It comes from two acres in the heart of the appellation, representing historic varieties still hanging on for dear life. Raisiny leather, gunpowder and an intensity of blueberry give it life, atop an undeniable funkiness that's hard to resist.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Seems pricy for what you get, which is a good but straightforward Pinot Noir to drink now. It's dry and elegant, with Pinot's silky texture, yet one-dimensional in cherry, cola and spice flavors, with a quick finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Harrison's Cabernet is a bit hard in youth, marked by strong tannins that make for an astringent mouthfeel. It's also somewhat linear in varietal flavor, with ripe black currants and blackberries and a certain minerality. Not drinkable now, but all indications are for a good future. Better after 2012.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A traditional and relatively light garnet color is the first sign that this is not a blatantly commercial wine. Savory, almost meaty, and cranberry-like aromas confirm the impression. Take a good sip and more crisp fruits like raspberries and red cherries emerge along with hints of cinnamon and clove for complexity. While medium bodied, it's vibrant in texture and elegantly balanced. It should improve through 2022.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A sound, everyday Zinfandel, this may be a little green and underripe, but it does show some berry-cherry flavor. The alcohol is very high.",US-California:Zinfandel
"An unusual blend dominated by Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with only ten percent Cabernet Sauvignon. Very dark, rich and fruity, with cassis, blackcurrant, anise and herb flavors that are wrapped in big, sturdy tannins. Too young to drink now, unless it's with an enormous dish like braised short ribs, but best left for four or five years.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Rich and ripe, this wine shows a great balance between fresh, fragrant fruit and toasty hints of maturity. There's a soft feel on the palate, but a tangy, vibrant texture adds complexity to this very fine wine. Drink now or cellar through 2018.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Packaged in a screwcap bottle with an eye-catching purple label, Re Midas is a textbook expression of Soave with fresh aromas of melon, peach and honey. This well-priced white delivers a compact but crisp mouthfeel.",Italy-Veneto:Garganega
"This opens with alluring aromas of Granny Smith apple, citrus zest and a hint of flint. On the creamy palate, notes of Alpine herb and mineral accent Abate Fetel pear and tangy nectarine. Lively acidity gives it a crisp finish. While enjoyable now, it will also drink well for several years. Enjoy through 2020.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Bianco
"The raspberry, cherry and vanilla flavors of this Pinot Noir taste sweet, giving it a delicious pie-filling richness. Crisp acidity fortunately provides balancing structure. It's a flashy young wine for drinking over the next five years.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Subtle aromas of blackberry, tilled earth and dark spice lead the way. On the straightforward palate, clove and a touch of white pepper add interest to black cherry while smooth tannins provide an accessible framework. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Central Italy:Sangiovese
"Principally Malbec, with 18% Tempranillo filling out the blend, this tangy and appealing wine wraps its red currant fruit in streaks of vanilla, tobacco and light herbs.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"From a small family vineyard along the appellation's highest slopes, this is a powerfully concentrated, mountain-driven wine, leathery, grippy and dusty in tannin. Black licorice, raspberry and blackberry jam flavors provide weight and expansion on the palate, with a touch of heat on the finish.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"The tannins are already finely integrated into the rich, ripe fruit. It has a smoky character along with a note of wood spice, and the black plum fruit serves as a juicy underlay. Given its weight and structure, this should for age five years at least.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"This traditional Champagne-style blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier entices on the nose with hints of golden toast, vanilla and biscuit. It's dense on the palate with a thick, aggressively mouth-filling foam, but tart, sprightly acidity accents pleasant apple and pear flavors.",US-New York:Champagne Blend
"Juicy cherry, strawberry and blueberry compete for attention in this fully plush and powerfully built wine. Its brawn is offset by a beautifully soft texture that gives it a lushness on the palate.",US-California:Petite Sirah
Crushed camomile leaves and fresh apricots beckon with ethereal lift. The palate oscillates between austerity and thrill with its uncompromising acidity. This is ready and open now but will continue to age.,Austria-Kremstal:Riesling
"In the dry style of Blin Champagnes, this is a fruity and very crisp wine. Sliced apples and crisp pears are cut with pink grapefruit and other citrus flavors. It is fresh with acidity that balances the fruit. The texture at the end is soft, lightly mineral.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"From winemaker Michael Zinke, this is yet another stylish Rhône-style blend. Aromas of boysenberry, plum, tar, black peppercorn and lavender delicately lay across the nose. The palate presents very judiciously and evenly, with dried purple flowers, black tea, slight teriyaki and just a touch of plum.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Pressed plum and dried berry meet with leather on the nose, becoming a bit musty over time. The dusty flavors carry to the sip, where underripe bramble provides tang but little else.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This young and fruity wine has red cherries that lie over soft tannins and a stalky texture. It's all about fruit that's ready to drink, and not for aging.",France-Loire Valley:Cabernet Franc
"A soft wine with attractive fruitiness and lemon and lime flavors. Fresh and rounded, it shows its northern French origins with the tight acidity at the end.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Chalky notes of baking soda meet with a nice sizzle of scratched lemon skin, slight bubble gum, fresh sourdough bread and pear blossom on the slightly yeasty nose. Tight lime skins, Asian pear flesh and pink grapefruit cling to a center line of texture and acidity.",US-California:Chardonnay
"A healthy portion of barrel influence is felt in this reserve wine, amid medium acidity. This makes for a robust, full-bodied experience, highlighted by caramel apple pie and pineapple, with muddles of butterscotch.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Tart and slightly bitter, this Lambrusco has all the right qualities to pair with fettuccine in cream sauce. Bright berry flavors are followed by creamy foam and fresh acidity.",Italy-Central Italy:Lambrusco
"This is quite an impressive Cabernet. The wine rivals an intense Napa Cabernet, with it's tannic structure and its bold flavors of blackberry, black currant and licorice that have been exquisitely oaked. It's elegantly drinkable now despite the power, but should comfortably glide through at least the next eight years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is a blend of fruit from the Columbia Gorge and Terrace Heights. White pepper, green vegetable and flower blossom aromas lead to light, dry, puckering fruit flavors. Put it on the dinner table to see it shine.",US-Washington:Grüner Veltliner
"The grapes used for this wine were grown in warm parts of Paso Robles, so even though the vintage was cool overall, this is a very ripe wine. It has blackberry, raisin, plum and sweet oak flavors, with a nice structure of acids and tannins.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"The Occitan origin of this estate's name, me trigo da dina, means “longing to dine,” and this richly endowed wine satisfies its remit. It has plenty of young tannins, which are sustained by ripe, juicy black fruit and ample acidity. Blending the three Cahors red grapes—Malbec, Merlot and Tannat—has made a wine with a fine future. Drink from 2019.",France-Southwest France:Red Blend
"Smoky, toasted walnut aromas and oaky flavors make this full-bodied wine taste like the volume is turned up loud. It feels firmly tannic and broad on the palate, its toasted oak qualities coating the mouth and lingering on the finish.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A brilliant Pinot Noir, grown organically from the winery's new vineyard in a cool part of the coastal mountains. More tannic and acidic than Pinots from the estate vineyard in Green Valley, it offers lush, deep flavors of cherries, black raspberries, gingersnap cookies and almond biscotti. Just terrific, and will take a few years of bottle age in a cool cellar.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is almost as impressive as Gerin's La Champine Syrah, which is a tremendous achievement as Viognier seems much harder to do well. Hints of crushed stone and struck flint add nuance to the ripe apricot aromas, while the exotic, tropical fruit flavors of mango and pineapple are reined in by a touch of citrus-pith bitterness. Drink now–2018.",France-Rhône Valley:Viognier
"Extra brut means that this Champagne is drier than most brut wines, while not totally dry as in brut zéro. This Extra Brut shows remarkable crispness, but also some ripeness with its apple and grapefruit flavors. It's one of those Champagnes that needs time to breathe, so open 30 minutes before you want to drink it—the bubbles won't disappear.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"The question is whether you should drink it now, or cellar it. It's dry and tannic and well-structured, and rich in blackberry, currant, cherry and plum fruit, with a long, spicy finish. It provides a good showcase for the emerging Coombsville region. Your best bet is to give it until 2019 in a good cellar to see what it's doing.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Snappy red fruit aromas endow this Cab with approachability, while the palate is clean, tasty and a little lean, with spicy, piquant raspberry flavors. Dry and peppery on the finish, but honest and clean throughout. Average wine; good value.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Spicy aromas of cedar, tree bark and herbal red-berry fruits announce a fruity, flush palate with flavors of raspberry and plum accented by woody chocolate. Dry, spicy, peppery flavors rest comfortably on a balanced finish.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A candied, buttery aroma, ripe fruit flavors and full body characterize this wine. It seems to have a strong spicy influence that comes with firm tannins and an almost-sweet character.",US-California:Tempranillo
"Winemakers Hélène Garcin and Patrice Levêque have coaxed a ton of character from 70-year-old Malbec and Cabernet vines, and the result is juicy but dark, with asphalt and tar aromas sitting in front of tight but generous black fruit (cassis and blackberry). Finishing notes of coffee, mocha and char leave you happy.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Red Blend
"This wine comes from the winery's plantings in the foothills of the Blue Mountains, a relatively unexplored region of the valley. Brooding aromas of ember, black and green olive, flower and earth lead to exceptionally pure-feeling fruit and savory flavors. It brings a compelling mouthfeel and sense of balance.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Dusty apple aromas are less citrusy than ideal, and the palate is cidery and tangy. Finishes with heft, length and weight, which all seems a little overbearing given the wine's simplicity. Just good enough but doesn't fully click.",Chile-Curicó Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Surprisingly thin for an Alexander Valley Cabernet, especially at this price. It's clean and proper, being dry and softly tannic, but the cherry and blackberry flavors taste watered down.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Plum, espresso, cedar and underbrush aromas unfold on this straightforward Sangiovese and 3% Cabernet Sauvignon blend. The ripe, warm palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry, vanilla, white pepper and a licorice note alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"This ripe, all-fruit wine tastes unoaked because a lush blend of apple, peach and pear crowds the aromas, and more of the same fruitiness expands in the flavors. The mouthfeel is especially gentle, and the finish almost sweet.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Consistent in every way with the previous vintage, this barrel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc includes 9% Sémillon, both of which were sourced from 15-year-old vines. It's aromatic with scents of sweet herb and citrus, and it tastes of Meyer lemon and grapefruit, plus a hint of brioche.",US-Washington:Sauvignon Blanc
"Smooth, floral berry aromas are easy to like. This crianza feels whole and plump. Lightly herbal tomato flavors blend with richer plum and berry notes in front of a balanced, mostly ripe finish.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"This delicate Barbaresco moves over the palate lightly and softly, imparting notes of wild berry, cedar, white truffle and licorice. The intensity builds in the mouth, where the wine gains momentum thanks to its tight, compact structure and its lingering tones of smoke and ash.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Quite foamy when poured, this bubbly from the historic sparkling house offers aromas of apple flesh, ripe pears and lemon-lime soda. It presents straightforward flavors on the palate accented with apple blossoms, while white tuberose florals and a touch of guava trend toward the tropical side of the scale.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"This Bordeaux blend is soft and somewhat sweet, with jammy blackberry, cherry and currant flavors accented with oak and tannins. It seems at its best now.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A very beautiful wine that shows the exotic, feral quality of the greatest Pinot Noirs from the Fort Ross area. It's explosive in wild raspberry and cherry flavors, with hints of pine, cola, wintergreen, anise, bacon and smoky, sweet vanillins from oak barrels. A wine of great pedigree, it's showing well now, and should hold for the next six years.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Subtle pear, orange rind and peach aromas lead this Riesling, along with a floral top note. It drinks off dry, with stone fruit and ale flavors that need more time in bottle to settle. It comes up a bit short on the finish.",US-Washington:Riesling
"Dark-skinned berry, forest floor, pipe tobacco, new leather and balsamic notes float out of the glass. On the elegantly structured palate, taut, polished tannins and vibrant acidity frame ripe red cherry, exotic spice and aromatic herb flavors. A lingering star anise note announces the close. Impeccably balanced and loaded with class, it's still young and needs time to fully develop. Drink 2022–2037.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This is an intriguing wine, with the extraction and the alcohol seemingly dialed back. Somewhat light in color, it brings aromas of fresh herb, sweet spice, cedar and cherry. The flavors are elegant and cranberry tart. It doesn't come off as entirely varietal but there's plenty of enjoyment to be had, especially if paired with food.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Soft and fleshy, this Cab has forward flavors of berries, chocolate, cedar and spices, with a touch of sweaty leather. Polished and easy to drink now.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of white flower, green pear and flinty mineral mingle in the glass. The bright palate offers creamy Granny Smith apple, nectarine, sage and a light mineral note. Bright acidity gives it a clean finish.",Italy-Southern Italy:Falanghina
"This top wine from a major Cahors estate shows the potential of great Malbec. With its dense tannins, rich black fruit flavors, acidity and restrained power, it is a major force. Even with all its weight, it's stylish, complex and ageworthy wine. Drink from 2021.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"Just plain delicious, this full-bodied wine starts with ripe blueberry and dark chocolate aromas. Next, generous, ripe, saturated fruit flavors flood the mouth, seeming to deepen with each sip. The mouthfeel stays smooth but is enhanced by moderate tannins and ample acidity for good balance.",US-California:Zinfandel
"While fairly neutral on the nose, the palate of this dry Riesling boasts bright, sunny citrus notes against a backdrop of apple and pear. It's straightforward in style, but crisp, pleasant drinking.",US-New York:Riesling
"Subdued aromas recall blue flower and berries, but overall the nose isn't very expressive. The one-dimensional palate offers red cherry but it's lean and short on freshness. This is starting to fade so drink now.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"A ripe and smooth wine that brings out all the fruitiness of the vintage. Just enough structure gives the wine shape, while yielding pride of place to the juicy fruits and attractive berry flavors. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Big, bold, dark and chewy, this builds upon substantial black-cherry fruit and supporting acids. Still knitting together, it shows highlights of cedar and tobacco, along with thick tannins. Give this a couple more years of bottle age, and drink after 2018.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"A fine wine, brisk in acidity and clean in the finish, with slightly sweet flavors of oranges, pears, peaches and honey. A nice cocktail sipper, or with Asian fare.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Grown at the winery's estate vineyard high up in Annapolis, where the ocean looms large, this is a tannic, smoky wine, densely layered in blue and black fruit. Cola, sage and black tea await in the background.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"Aromas of blackberry, plum, coffee and toast lead the nose. The full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, toasted oak, coconut and oak-driven spice alongside assertive tannins that leave a drying finish. Drink soon before the remaining fruit disappears.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This wine brings immediate appeal, with notes of blueberry, vanilla and baking spices. The palate is sweet and supple, with plentiful blue-fruit flavors that linger.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Produced from old vines, this big and rounded wine has dark, dusty tannins that come from the concentrated fruit flavors as much as the wood. It comes from a producer whose main quinta, São Bernardo, was created in 1912. It is a dense, brooding wine that shows great weight and power. Black plum, dark berries and intense acidity are there in richness and profusion. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red

"Peach, melon and acacia aromas are friendly but simple. This has shearing acidity and thus it comes across fresh but lemony on the palate. Flavors of nectarine, lemon-lime and pineapple finish snappy and with lasting acidity.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño
"Lifted, primary notions of pear drop make for an appetizing opening. The palate is light and bouncy and full of sunny pears—both green and yellow. The finish is fresh and clean. This is lively and thirst-quenching. Drink soon.",Austria-Kremstal:Grüner Veltliner
"Mature black cherry, leather, grilled herb, ground pepper and balsamic notes are just some of the aromas and flavors of this stunning Nebbiolo. It's well balanced with bracing, noble tannins and bright acidity but it still needs time to come together. Drink 2018–2035. Giuliana Imports, PDX Wine.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Crimson is half Merlot, one-third Cab Franc, the rest a mix of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon. There's some volatility in the nose, with bright, spicy strawberry fruit swathed in light chocolate. The midpalate drops out.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The cool conditions that defined the 2011 vintage in Chile are draped all over this Chardonnay. The nose deals notes of applesauce and oaky cinnamon, while the palate is sleepy, with very little happening. Flavors of spicy oak rest on top of white fruit flavors, and the finish is neutral and acidic.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Chardonnay
"This wood-aged wine shows equal notes of toasty spice and ripe fruit. On the palate, it's full and round, with pear and apricot flavors giving it richness. This is concentrated and worth aging for another 2–3 years.",France-Southwest France:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"A little rough around the edges, this wine still has some attractive black berry and damson flavors and shows acidity and a texture of dry tannins. For medium-term aging.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This wine is dominated by Grenache, which makes up 80% of the blend. That gives the spice and pepper edge as well as bringing out delicious red-berry fruits and crisp acidity. The wine, with its bright aftertaste,is ready to drink now.",France-Provence:Rosé
"There is an excellent depth of flavor in this ripe and fruity wine. It is more about rich fruits than it is about structure, giving a full and rounded character to the plum-jelly, spice and mint flavors. Ready to drink in a year.",France-Southwest France:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Rounded and soft, this rich rosé is fruity while also perfumed. The blending of Syrah in the mix gives the wine a sense of power and concentration, making it an adquate partner at the dinner table.",France-Provence:Rosé
"A lively Champagne, initially all froth and fizz. But get through that and there is a pleasant, slightly sweet wine— perhaps more full-bodied than some. The primary red-fruit flavors have been lessened by some bottle age, leaving a wine which has a hint of maturity.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Lemon- and pineapple-rind aromas lead to a green apple-driven palate. Medium-bodied yet crisp, this would pair well with citrus-marinated chicken kabobs.",US-Virginia:Chardonnay
"Rich, ripe and concentrated, the lush array of black fruits is enhanced with a generous amount of barrel-generated baking spices. There's a chef's pantry of cinnamon, ginger and more, along with a vein of molasses and a whiff of coffee running through the tannins. It's a total yum-fest.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine shows some maturity, with toast flavors coming through the creamy mousse. White stone fruit and streaks of citrus give a fresher end to this well-balanced wine.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Surprisingly lithe for a Napa rosé that's made from Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. It's pretty dark in color, but feels fresh and clean, with penetrating raspberry jam, red currant and vanilla flavors. You could drink this on a hot summer evening with barbecued steak.",US-California:Rosé
"This bright Vernaccia layers pretty tones of citrus, pear and cut grass over a lean texture and medium body. This is a good choice to pair with seafood or light salads.",Italy-Tuscany:Vernaccia
"Oakville specialist Far Niente turns to Rutherford for this single-vineyard, 100% Cab. The wine is soft and exceptionally ripe in blackberry and cherry fruit flavors, while lots of toasty oak adds vanilla accents that make the wine jammy.

"Alluring scents of pressed violet, perfumed berry and a whiff of cake spice lead the nose. The bright, chewy palate doles out layers of ripe black cherry, blackberry, raspberry, chopped mint and a sprinkling of cocoa. Soft, round tannins support the juicy flavors. There's not much complexity but it is mouthwateringly delicious. Drink through 2017.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nero d'Avola
"This rich wine features ripe, jammy red-plum and cherry fruits. It is dense, with its tannins and a touch of pepper coming from the high alcohol. The wine is a blend from five parcels. Ripe and with a juicy aftertaste, it will be best from 2018.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
Spicy strawberry scents are a bit hampered by some rubbery aromas which may subside over time. Soft tannins frame raspberry and black cherry flavors in the mouth which persist on the juicy finish.,Italy-Piedmont:Dolcetto
"Caramelized white peach, salted lemon, pear skin, red apple and the hint of white flowers show on the nose of this wine by these longtime but under-the-radar producers. The palate blends orange skins and grapefruit pith with buttered toast, sea salt and a dill-like herb character.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Austere and slightly bittersweet at the start, this wine evolves into flavors of lemon and lime around large wrappings of oak that give it a woody taste. The finish is lean and brief.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Black sage, wispy black cherry, dried violets, star anise and a woody character combine for a wondrous nose on this wine by regional pioneer Dan Lee. It's rich on the palate, with clove and nutmeg adding complexity to the plum, dried cherry and fennel bulb flavors.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"From 40-year-old vines in the Geelong GI, this is a huge step up in quality from the winery's Jindalee label. Nutty aromas of toasted cereal grain and grilled peaches set the table for this full-bodied, lushly textured Chardonnay. It's rich and ripe, yet reasonably balanced by acid, finishing long and ever so slightly warm. Drink now.",Australia-Australia Other:Chardonnay
"Slow to show its quality, with a little aeration this becomes a superripe wine, its wood element dominated by the intense tropical fruits. There is some balancing restraint in the citrus character, along with the acidity. Enjoy now.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Blended from various vineyards around the valley, this is a pretty, polished Cabernet for drinking now. Dry and softly tannic, it has lush, appealing black currant, black cherry jam, herb tea and smoky cedar flavors. It's fancy and a good value.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This leads with delicate aromas of violet and woodland berry. On the lively palate, a touch of almond adds interest the red-berry core. It's easy drinking, with fresh acidity and a light, tannic frame. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Schiava
"Though the term late harvest would suggest a sweet, dessert wine, this is more on the off-dry side of Riesling, with juicy acids that cut the impression of sugar. Fragrant with scents and flavors of apricots, apple pie, honey and biscuit, it is expressive, nicely balanced and loaded with flavor.",US-Washington:Riesling
"Hints of earth are the only aromas on the nose, which seems devoid of fruit. The palate has a similar leafy earthiness and slight berry aromas. There are bitter edges on the very slender, soft and easy body. This has a picnic-style rusticity about it and a very clean and dry finish.",France-Alsace:Pinot Noir
"Tannic and extracted, with gritty tannins and dark, almost dried fruit. This is powerful stuff, framed by hints of brown sugar and baking spices. Try pairing it against char-grilled steak or lamb.",Australia-Victoria:Shiraz
"Subdued aromas of spirits, raisin, menthol and resin emerge on this. The bulky palate shows blistering alcohol and a hint of raisin but it lacks fruit richness. Grainy tannins leave a raspy finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Relatively light in the glass, this blend of nine vineyards from up and down the coast shows savory baked plum, cardamom dust, earthy cranberry, bay leaf and smoked meat on the nose. It's medium bodied on the palate and very down-the-middle flavor-wise, with cranberry, oregano and thyme elements.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This ripe wine has rich black fruits, a smoky character and a rounded, full-bodied texture. The old vines bring concentration, while the acidity gives freshness and drinkability now.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"This wine comes from Gascony, where the Gascon and his famous beret are inseparable. This blend of mainly Gros Manseng has some herbal character but it also has yellow fruits, and a ripe edge of honey that softens and fills out the crisp green-fruit flavors. Drink now.",France-Southwest France:White Blend
"Deep-amber colored, this orange wine has aromas of sunbaked earth, brimstone, overripe orange zest and pressed wild flower. The lean but lively palate offers dried nectarine slices, toasted almond and a hint of dried apricot alongside bright acidity. A salty note closes the finish. While lovers of orange wine might embrace this, it's definitely not for everyone.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Ribolla Gialla
"The nose of this wine is restrained, just giving away pear and citrus, but the dry palate is concentrated and spiced with almond and marzipan. Ample tone from mouthwatering acidity will make this a huge winner at any table. It has great poise and balance.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"Made from the same blend as the dry Orvieto, in this version fermentation is stopped before all the sugars are converted to alcohol. A moderately sweet wine, it boasts apricot, honey and almond notes, with just enough acidity to avoid a cloying finish. Pair it with cream cheeses or almond cookies.",Italy-Central Italy:White Blend
"This bright red blend from southern Italy offers modest aromas of black cherry, blackberry pie and crushed black pepper. The mouthfeel manages to be plush, clean and crisp at the same time.",Italy-Southern Italy:Red Blend
"This wine brings the Trebbiano grape to a whole new level of sophistication. You'll get stone fruit, melon and apricot, but you'll also be rewarded with radically unique aromas of melted butter, brown sugar and crunchy crème caramel. The texture is smooth and firm and the wine's persistency can be counted in minutes.",Italy-Central Italy:Trebbiano
"Candied and thin on the nose, and that's pretty much what follows. The palate is dilute, while the flavors of red fruits are crisp and semisour. Scratchy and tart on the finish as well.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"A very rich and soft wine made from hand-squeezed Malbec grapes. There's a ton of oak on it, which comes out as coconut and cream on the nose. The palate is also creamy, with mocha, sweet blackberry and fudge flavors. Cola, coconut, coffee and other hedonistic, dark, masculine accents make this a fun and interesting wine to drink now. Best on its own or with meat.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Forward and immediately delicious, this has a mix of peach, pear, apple and the more expected red fruits; it's a wild panoply of fruit flavor, with balancing acids and tannins. Round, forward, full bodied and textural, it is a uniquely flavorful wine with distinctive fruit-laden profile.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"A velvet-textured wine, relatively light because of the vintage, but oh-so tender, the tannins whispering behind the sweet fruits. This is regarded as the second wine of Clos de Tart Grand Cru and shows the same generous, plush character.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"This variety is an extreme rarity in this appellation. This one offers aromas of wet penny, spice and red fruit. The palate is medium bodied, with the tannins bringing some grit.",US-Washington:Tempranillo
"Classy aromas of pear, stone fruits and resiny but controlled oak lead to a pure, moderately woody and balanced palate that delivers ripe apple, melon and peach flavors along with oak backing. Vanilla and walnut flavors grace a nicely textured, creamy yet lively finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Chardonnay
The wine is ripe and full of blackberry fruits. It has serious tannins still although these are well balanced by the fruitiness. The firm structure and wood aging flavor will soften over the next few years. Drink from 2020.,France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Fermented and aged in barriques, this Sauvignon is overwhelmed by wood. It's loaded with sensations of toasted oak, butterscotch and vanilla with a hint of lemon drop. It lacks the fruit richness to support the dominate wood.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon
"Intense aromas of mature black cherry, licorice, leather and a balsamic note lead the nose and follow over to the palate along with cranberry and a note of pipe tobacco. Tightly packed, rather austere tannins provide firm support and need time to unwind. Drink after 2012.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"A mix of floral and schisty cherry, raspberry and strawberry aromas are subtle, elegant and reserved. This blend of Garnacha and Syrah is fresh, but with a touch of jammy weight. Flavors of minerally plum and red currant are supported by oak and vanilla notes, while the finish is tight, racy and peppery in flavor. Drink through 2018.",Spain-Catalonia:Red Blend
"The opening is nice and chunky, with jammy blackberry aromas. The palate on this Tempranillo-led Rioja is full-bodied, with grip and flavors of herbal berry, tea, smoked meat and lemony oak. There's a hint of green to the medium-length finish, which is firm in feel and oaky in flavor.",Spain-Northern Spain:Red Blend
"The 2006 vintage is a tricky one for Barolo because it favors elegance and power over softness and concentration. This expression from the talented team at Coppo shows the vintage well with this compact, astringent and ethereal expression that needs more time to soften.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Refreshing and bright, this would pair with a range of Mediterranean foods, from tomato bruschetta to fried zucchini flowers. It offers a steady flow of citrus, pear and stone fruit flavors.",Italy-Veneto:Garganega
"This solid Sauvignon is lean and focused, yet manages to show some ripe melon (specifically cantaloupe) flavors to go with its core of tart limes.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon Blanc
"Rustic aromas recall barnyard, game and overripe black fruit. The palate offers mature plum layered with chocolate, vanilla and game, with extremely astringent tannins that give a drying, lean finish.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Made from a cool, steep site near the tiny town of Occidental, this white is lemony crisp and quite austere. A food-friendly wine suggestive of star fruit and just-ripe pineapple, it finishes somewhat spicy.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This clonal study blends rich black cherry and sassafras notes with cola, savory herbs, strong iron and slight scorched rubber aromas. The palate jumps from a red cherry and cranberry tartness right into a toasted sage and pencil-lead character.",US-California:Pinot Noir
There's a hint of mandarin or pink grapefruit that adds a touch of zesty citrus to what is a balanced and mostly mineral-driven Prosecco Brut. The wine is lively and tonic thanks to its pulpy fruit flavors and creamy froth.,Italy-Veneto:Prosecco
"This wine emphasizes some of the tougher elements of the Pinotage aroma/flavor profile, with lots of barnyard, earth and leather. The light cherry fruit struggles to balance with the rustic notes.",South Africa-Stellenbosch:Pinotage
"Smooth and creamy, this is round, ripe and attractively cut with acidity. It has white fruit flavors, pears and red apples giving ripeness. A light touch of toastiness adds further interest. Drink now.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"A 100% varietal wine from the Napa producer, this is sourced from the expansive appellation known as Sonoma Coast. The wine exhibits cooler-climate herbal tendencies against a smooth palate, subtle oak and red fruit. It finishes in sizable tannins.",US-California:Syrah
"A refreshing wine, with nicely ripened fruit and exceptional balance, that's pleasant in every way and a super value, too.  The fruit goes beyond citrus into more deeply flavored apricot and pear, and modest sur lie aging adds creamy, buttery notes.  This is a lovely wine and one of the best values of the year in Sauvignon/Fume Blanc.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"From the rocky, volcanic soils of the mighty, high-elevation vineyard, this wine imparts generous layers of blood-red berry, smoke, vanilla and cranberry, a testament to terroir and unobtrusive winemaking. Powerfully built in tight, leathery structure, it conveys a distinct taste of that volcanic rock.",US-California:Zinfandel
"With all the freshness of the vintage, this fruity wine shows good balance between tangy acidity and crisp apple and green-plum fruits. Subtle touches of wood give a spicy, nutmeg flavor to complement the bright fruitiness. Drink from 2018. The vineyard is next door to the Grand Cru Montrachet vines.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Relatively restrained for Viognier, with attractive fruit notes of muskmelon, apricot and pineapple, but not much more in the way of complexity. It's medium bodied, with a long, refreshing finish that hints at white pepper. Drink now.",France-Rhône Valley:Viognier
"A light, bright, deliciously lemony wine, with an attractive aromatic lift. Fruity, ready to drink now.",Portugal-Lisboa:Portuguese White
"Tough and chewy now, with a fibrous, tannic mouthfeel like a bite of beef jerky. Similar flavors, too, of teriaki beef, but the underlying fruit is massive, offering waves of cherries, black raspberries, currants and cola. This is a very fine wine, but an immature one. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar, if you can keep your hands off.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the rest equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot. It's subtle on the nose, with currant, flower, crushed rock and herb notes. The palate is firmly structured, punctuating the flavors on the finish. Best 2025–2030.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"There is a lovely balance to this Viognier, and a sense that these cool-climate grapes were not pushed too far. The winemaker, happily, chose to make the wine that the vineyard gave her. Delicate and layered, with paper-thin suggestions of citrus rind, grapefruit and white peach. Still tightly knit, this wine very slowly unwinds long after you've swallowed that first sip or two.",US-Washington:Viognier
"This powerful blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Franc by longtime urban winemaker Benjamin Silver comes together in a big way. Aromas recall rosemary-crusted beef, boysenberry, sweet tar and, thanks to the oak-aging, both caramel and vanilla. The rich palate shows black cherry, black raspberry and a pinch of tarragon.",US-California:Red Blend
"A dark-colored wine, this is layered with a wood note that shows strongly along with the mint flavor. Rich, well structured and concentrated, this has black jelly fruit, and is meant for drinking in two years.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Named after the pine-tree aromas that come from the trees around the Dão vineyards, this wine is perfumed with structured black-currant fruits and wild-berry flavors. Its tannins and balanced concentration are just right. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Dão:Portuguese Red
"Tight and crisp, this wine is laden with acidity as well as dry tannins. The fruit element is still developing, hints of red berries beginning to come through. It's a wine to age for several months, so drink from 2016.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"If this Cava weren't so pickled in smell and taste, it would rate better. As is, it opens with white fruit, vanilla and brine aromas. Flavors of apple and pear maintain a prevalent, pickled edge, while the finish falls off in feel and clarity.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"Brunello is the perfect winter wine to enjoy by a roaring fire with friends or a romantic partner. This expression from Terralsole is particularly well suited to this happy fate thanks to its silky, soft nature, firm tannins, spice aromas and bursting fruit tones.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"This zesty icewine, with its lemon, spice and mineral backbone, offers a light and playful take on the dessert wine coveted by so many worldwide. Delicate and not overly sweet, this shows some restraint and subtlety, lending it to food pairing and solo sipping.",US-New York:Riesling
"Substantial and varietally precise, this shows nicely focused red and black fruits with a concentrated backing of toast, coffee grounds, baking spices and chocolate. The fruit and barrel flavors are perfectly integrated, dusty and lush.",US-Washington:Syrah
"A little too hot and brawny in tannins, which provides a cut across the palate that interferes with pleasure. If you can get past that, the wine is nicely dry and rich in fruit, with cherry, tobacco, spice and oak flavors.",US-California:Cabernet Franc
"Steely at first, this wine softens like butter on the palate, with a luxurious, silky feel, complemented by lemon zest and brine. Lighter in style, it never holds back on texture or flavor, making for a beautiful, food-friendly white.",US-California:Chardonnay
"The heavy bottle is quite unnecessary with this impressive wine that boasts its own richness and weight. Honeyed, smooth with an opulent, rounded texture, it is also so well balanced with its acidity. This beautiful wine will still develop. Drink at its best from 2017.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"Rustic earth and the aromatic sparks of a rose garden open this wine, named by combining the middle names of the producer and her husband. Tight, youthful tannins hover around chocolate, strawberry and blackberry notes, resulting in a velvety texture on the expansive palate. It finishes quietly and confidently, eager to develop further in bottle; enjoy through 2023.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"An almost tropical overtone of passion fruit precedes the zesty, herbal notes that fizz away on nose and palate. Citrus zest frames the palate which is streamlined, light-bodied but concentrated. This offers verve, clean-cut refreshment and zesty length.",Austria-Wachau:Grüner Veltliner
"Heavily earthy and rubbery smelling, then big and bulky but out of whack on the palate. Tastes buttery and gummy, with generic berry fruit flavors that finish oaky.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Tempranillo
"Damaged by hail in 2013, the vineyards yielded low quantities. The grapes harvested produced a wine with crisp red fruits and bright berry acidity. The fresh, tight aftertaste suggests the wine will age. Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Honey, lime rinds and just ripe peach greet the nose on this dry single-vineyard expression by Michael Callahan. The palate is extremely vibrant and citrus-driven, with a very chalky minerality and a very slightly oxidized touch of nuts on the finish. It's minerally mean and extremely, bracingly dry.",US-California:Riesling
Old vines on the Aegerter Domaine in Savigny-lès-Beaune give a rounded ripe wine. It has a crisper red-cherry side to its otherwise smooth texture. The tannins support all this juicy fruit and offer a chance for the wine to age. Drink from 2020.,France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Consulting winemaker Michel Rolland oversees this bottling in the Long Shadows series. Fans of his forward, sometimes voluptuous style may find this vintage a bit thin. The fruit is peppery and the tannins chewy, while the barrel flavors of chocolaty oak have not quite assimilated. Further bottle age might improve the wine.",US-Washington:Merlot
"This is a light and fruity wine from J. Portugal Ramos. It's crisp, with lemon and citrus flavor, and bright with grapefruit acidity. Drink now and over the next year.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese White
"Still firm and tannic, this dense wine will need some time to develop. It has dark tannins and concentrated red-plum and berry flavors. A smoky background from the wood aging will soften over the next year. However with the tannins, the wine should not be drunk before 2020.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
There is just a faint touch of honeysuckle on the nose. The palate follows with creamy floral peach notes on an incredibly light-bodied fluid palate of great intensity and stony depth. It is only on the aftertaste that the full volume and power of these aromatics shine. This feels like the aromatic heart of Alsace itself.,France-Alsace:Muscat
"Dark fruit and a meaty consistency make for a bold and delicious first impression. The wine delivers layers of cherry, blackberry spice, leather and spicy tobacco. The wine shows some modern oak touches of vanilla softness, but by no means in an exaggerated fashion.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Espresso, toast and spice aromas lead the nose and carry over to the palate alongside notes of black cherry and compact tannins. Despite the tannic structure, this isn't an ager so drink soon to capture the remaining fruit flavors.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
This Prosecco Extra Dry has full notes of almond and stone fruit backed by sticky honey and mature fruit. The wine tastes sweet and fruity and has pretty floral nuances with some mildly sour flavors on the finish.,Italy-Veneto:Prosecco
"Bright red cherry and chewy blackberry notes are followed by sweet spice, nutmeg and cinnamon. There's a grapy element to the bouquet that underscores the wine's youth and informality.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"This is a great wine for fans of the flashy, almost sweet, dark colored and fully oaked style of Zin. It has a tasty sense of maple syrup on waffles, boysenberries and vanilla. Full-bodied and concentrated, it's firm in texture and slightly sweet on the finish.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Ripe and juicy, this wine comes mainly from vines in the Mâcon region. Attractive yellow fruit flavors are filled out with spice and almond, accented by refreshing acidity. Drink now.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"There's no shortage of ripe aromas: leather, berries and aged cheese. Yet the palate is quite sharp, with searing acidity sitting on top of red-berry flavors. This wine has unlimited aging potential, but will it ever taste great? That remains to be seen.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"Full-bodied, rich and chewy, this is a big, bold wine. Ample oak frames black cherry and cassis fruit, adding hints of vanilla and dark chocolate to the fudge-like impression. Warmth suffuses the palate, but doesn't quite progress to full-blown high-alcohol heat. There's no doubting its impressive intensity and ripeness. Drink now–2025.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
"The Adelaide Hills aren't known as a hotspot for Cabernet Sauvignon, but this offering, from a warm site, excels. Cinnamon, clove, cracked pepper and vanilla notes accent dark, meaty fruit. It's full and rich enough to be mistaken as coming from a warmer region, with a long, earthy finish. Drink now–2025.",Australia-South Australia:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a good wine, fancy and dry, with plenty of acidity. The citrus, peach and gooseberry flavors have an edge of new French oak. Hall bought this vineyard from Iron Horse, who used to blend some Viognier into the wine, with excellent results.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Here's a ruby-colored Passito made with sweet Moscato Rosa grapes. This is not exactly a complex wine, but boy is it intense. Putting your nose in the glass is like burying your face is a bouquet of fresh red roses. Those amazing floral fragrances appear on the wine's long, sweet finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Red Blend
"Full-throttle lime, peach and strawberry aromas come through on the nose, with a trace of toast. It drinks as fruity as it smells. There’s some pretty toast and good acidity, and it finishes fruity and a little sweet.",US-California:Champagne Blend
"This wine is a blend of 70% Mourvèdre, 25% Grenache and 5% Syrah. It opens with achingly pure red currant, cranberry, black pepper, blue fruit, orange peel and dried herb aromas that completely captivate the senses. The palate shows a hypnotic sense of purity along with a sense of elegance that is dazzling. Smoked meat flavors linger on the long finish.",US-Washington:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Attractive floral aromas and bright cherry and raspberry flavors make a light, refreshing impression. This medium-bodied wine has light tannins and lively acidity in the texture.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Young and spicy, this easy-drinking Pinot Gris still shows some bite and some bitterness, perhaps from skin contact. Give it a little more bottle age, and drink it chilled, to bring out the tart fruit and cut the phenolics.",US-Oregon:Pinot Gris
"Meat, compost and leather notes mark the entry of this Syrah blended with smaller amounts of Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah. Light black pepper and red fruit flavors are sustained by a soft, round texture and lingering finish.",US-California:Syrah
"In this opulent, layered and full-bodied wine, a smoky beefy aroma and a melt-in-the-mouth texture come with flavors of dark maraschino cherries, dark chocolate and baking spices. It's very mouth filling and mouth coating as well as firmly tannic, but the richness of the flavors helps it to drink very smoothly.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"Brawny, with an explosive concentration of blackberry, this intense wine offers hints of tobacco, smoked meat and black licorice elevated on the palate. Blended with small amounts of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, it finishes on a bittersweet note and with some black pepper. Cellar through 2020.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is an absolutely lovely Pinot Noir that's softly refined and balanced, yet so complex. It's silky and dry, with waves of raspberries and cherries, red currants, mocha, red licorice and sautéed wild mushrooms. Drink now–2015 for fresh appeal.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Get to know the local red grapes of Gaillac that make up this blend: Duras, Braucol and Prunelard. Together, they create impressive structure, concentration and intensity. Acidity balances the bold red fruit and ripe cherry flavors. It's a serious wine with good potential and will be best from 2020.",France-Southwest France:Red Blend

"This lightly aromatic wine conveys ripe red apple, pear, and star fruit. The fruit flavors are centered in a ball in the middle, offering plenty of appeal if not much complexity.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"Refreshingly dry Champagne. With its tight strawberry flavors, it is forward and fruity. It has a fine burst of lime acidity to complement the red fruits. Not for aging, delicious now.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"This is a lively and structured blend that integrates Tannat with Merlot and Petit Verdot. With 11 months in French oak, toasted coffee and tobacco notes ride over ripe cherry, plum and currant aromas. The tannins are sandy on the palate, giving ample structure to a dark fruit-driven wine. Freshly crushed black pepper lingers on the finish.",US-Virginia:Red Blend

"Intensely crisp wine, very fresh, with red currant fruit flavors, a touch of caramel, but deliciously refreshing. Great as a mouthwatering apéritif. Screwcap.",Austria-Burgenland:Blaufränkisch
"Sweet with raspberry jam, cherry liqueur and vanilla cream flavors, this is a good dessert wine. But it could be a lot better if it were more intense. The finish trails off a little.",US-California:Grenache
"Fully ripe aromas of blackberry, raisin, vanilla and wood grain set up a fleshy, bold palate that's tannic, but not tough or impermeable. Savory oak and ripe berry fruit flavors finish chewy and dense, with moderate complexity. Drink through 2025.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Young, tight and sharp, showing lots of black currant, along with pepper and spice. Maybe just a notch below the excellent 2004 L'Etalon Red. Tasted twice over a six month period, the wine remains stubbornly tough and chewy, despite appealing chocolaty spice and penetrating raspberry/currant fruit.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Vacillates between seeming totally fresh and clean and showing herbal, light green notes. There's graham cracker, jammy blackberry and bergamot on the nose, but also a pickled element. Grabby, chunky and jammy in the mouth, with juicy acidity and blue fruit flavors.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Syrah
"The back label notes that this fruit is from the Whistling Ridge Vineyard. It's rich and concentrated, a mix of apple, pear and green banana. Creamy and dense, it coats the mouth and lingers deliciously.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay

"Sunbaked earth, mature black-skinned berry and brown spice aromas take center stage. The round easygoing palate doles out dried Marasca cherry, blackberry and a hint of star anise. Pliant tannins lend easy drinking support.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Maple, black fruit and cocoa aromas lead to lighter styled dark-fruit flavors. The barrel influence at times seems a bit heavy, with the flavors not able to stand up to it.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Whiffs of zesty lemon and fresh herbs lend vitality to rich, honeyed peach flavors on this unabashedly juicy, semi-dry Kabinett. An ideal late-summer apéritif at an excellent price, it finishes with a bracing shower of jasmine tea and lime acidity.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"This blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon is light in color and offers aromas such as old leather, pipe tobacco, prune and chopped herbs with a slightly dirty, earthy quality. Yet it's lively in the mouth, with tight tannins, fresh acidity and bright cherry flavors.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Bright aromas of vanilla, toast and wood spice lead to a full-bodied, rich palate. The style gets out in front of the fruit but there's still much to enjoy.",US-Washington:Chardonnay

"Soft and fruity, this has ripe black-cherry and blackberry compote flavors, plus plenty of oak influence. Drink now.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Scents of purple fruits and wood smoke lead into a straightforward, fruity wine that plays out broadly across the palate. Despite its forward nature, it thins out quickly. There's a bit of chocolate (from aging in 25% new French oak) in the finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"With alcohol just 12.5%, this high-toned, fruit-driven Riesling has some residual sugar, but does not taste all that sweet. The extra ripe fruit suggests tropical candy—pineapple, papaya and lemon sours.",US-Oregon:Riesling
"This vintage of Fontal, a basic crianza from La Mancha, shows structure, some tannin and body, and finally solid cherry and plum fruit. With a blast of obvious oak and a forward personality, it makes its point.",Spain-Central Spain:Tempranillo
"Moscato-like with its jasmine and lychee aromas, but things fall apart in the mouth. It's overly foamy and active, with bland flavors that lack the powdery, floral elements that can make Torrontés good. Gaseous on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Torrontés
"This is a full, ripe wine that's rounded and rich on the palate. With ripe yellow fruit and tangerine flavors, it's tropical in style, although there is a tangy lemon edge to it to keep it crisp and herbaceous.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Holding the massive bottle in your hand, you'd rightly expect the wine inside to be a bit of a monster. But instead, it's a light, almost delicate effort, with pretty cherry fruit edged in smoky toast. There is nothing to indicate either vineyard or winemaking facility, but someone has a nice elegant touch. Drink now through 2020.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"From four acres at the crest of a knoll onsite, this wine is indelibly crisp in cranberry and orange. It's structured and classy, with a zesty acidity that belies the darker, deeper elements of toasted oak and Asian spice. The tannins are there, but subtle and supportive, resulting in a pretty yet substantive selection.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of bluish-black fruit, exotic spice and a balsamic note. The firmly structured palate doles out blackberry, spiced blueberry, coffee and black pepper accompanied by assertive but fine-grained tannins.",Italy-Central Italy:Red Blend
"The concerted impact of bergamot, grapefruit, tangerine and lemon is almost surreal—its headiness reaches long neglected memories of deep summer mingled with the freshness of the open sea. The intensity of spicy grapefruit and the skin of still-green Seville oranges transports you to utopian shores. That such flavor should come from grapes is one of nature's unresolved, eternal mysteries. That this should shine in such a concentrated, slender wine is a marvel.",Austria-Kremstal:Riesling

"This is Tendril's reserve offering, better than ever in 2014. Deeply inscribed flavors of black cherry, cola and espresso come through in a textural, detailed and quite delicious wine.

Toasted nuts, crackers and a dash of salt complete the flavors.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir

"Malbec and Bonarda are the lead grapes in this four-variety blend that shows improvement from the 2004, which was tough.

"In this collaboration between Ken Forrester and Jesse Katz, Katz sources from the same site he favors for his Devil Proof Malbec, crafting here a creamy, decadent Cabernet stuffed in coconut macaroon, blueberry and black cherry fruit. Soft, rounded and yet entirely structured and lush, it is delicious right now and yet should be even more seductive in time, through 2020.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Tasty and full-bodied, this is a wine you might mistake for a Chateauneuf, with its plummy, blackberry and spice flavors. Heavy for a Pinot, with thick but manageable tannins, but still a good, rich wine.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A fuller-bodied, richer and denser style of Pinot Noir than many of the producer's other offerings, this one traffics in toasted oak and tannin before revealing dark cherry and leather. Generous, it finishes dry and with power. Cellar through 2022.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Young winemaker Collin Cranor's best Cabernet to date, intense and rounded by savory black cherry, still wound tight but already showing off its oak, sage and tobacco goodness. The wine is well-structured and rich in vanilla and blackberry, a testament to the winemaker's close workings with grower Julio Covarrubias.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Vibrant and poised, this charming red opens with scents of red berry, iris and aromatic herb. The luminous palate offers red cherry, mint and orange zest while a firm vein of acidity and supple tannins provide freshness and an easy-drinking structure. Drink through 2017.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"The two-acre Clos du Chapitre vineyard is in the center of the Gevrey-Chambertin village. The wine is rich, full-bodied, full of red fruits, dark cherries and a rounded, perfumed character. It's powerful with its firm structure and complex balance between fruit and acidity. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Upfront jalapeño, white pepper and freshly sliced bell pepper aromas lead the nose of this wine. It's soft in texture and an intriguing example of the variety.",US-Washington:Carmenère
"Darker, sterner and less accessible than Plantagenet's Omrah bottling, the winery's flagship Shiraz offers substantial dark fruit flavors reminiscent of espresso, plum and cracked pepper. The tannins are firm, suggesting at least 2–3 years of cellaring. (The 2007 is drinking well now.)",Australia-Western Australia:Shiraz
"Equal parts Heart of the Hill and Red Heaven fruit, this wine opens with barrel aromas of vanilla and shaved coconut in front of dark fruit. The flavors are full in feel but retain a sense of elegance, with cranberry and vanilla flavors intertwining on the finish. The barrel notes are quite prominent but overall it works.",US-Washington:Mourvèdre
"In ‘99 Adelsheim bottled two separate clonal selections; this year they have elected to combine the two. This lovely, young wine, with very ripe, tight fruit, is already showing a bit more peach, apricot and tropical scents than the previous vintage. This is a concentrated, complex and powerful style, which harnesses the oak rather than being driven by it. Delicious and exceptionally long.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"Wood aromas and spice show strongly in this wine. On the palate, there is a toasty character that gives a bitter edge to the ripe red fruits. That needs to go, so wait to drink this wine from 2019.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"This wine is still settling into the bottle, with light spritzy scents of honeysuckle, pear and ripe peach. The off-dry stone-fruit flavors exhibit well-balanced acidity that carries through the finish. The concentration comes off as somewhat light but what's there is good.",US-Washington:Riesling
"Tastes its best now, with jammy blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors, and a rich overlay of oak. The tannins and acids are soft and gentle.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This opens with aromas suggesting pear, yellow stone fruit, Mediterranean herb and a whiff of citrus while the vibrant palate delivers crisp green apple, juicy lime, saline and energizing mineral. Racy acidity provides the backbone. Give this time to fully develop. Drink 2017 through 2024.",Italy-Southern Italy:Greco
"Good density for a young wine. There is weight here, dry tannins that integrate well with the berry fruits and the wood. Firm, still developing; keep for 2 years.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A smooth and fruity wine, it has plenty of attractive red berry fruits, some firm tannins and youthful juicy character. It is obviously still new. Although it can be drunk now, it will be better from 2015.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"As always, this attractive non-vintage Champagne is light, fruity and fragrant. It has crisp apple, pear and green-plum flavors and a refreshing citrus acidity. It is full in the mouth, but finishes with a reverberating softness.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Packed with wood and fruit tannins, it is a solid, dark and dense wine that will develop well. It shows great structure, concentrated berry fruits and final acidity. Wait until 2017 before drinking.",Portugal-Tejo:Touriga Nacional
"The wine is so light and pale in color, it just hints at fruitiness. It seems as if by taking out the color, the producer has also taken out the flavor. The wine is drinkable, but bland.",France-Provence:Rosé
"Hints of orange blossom accent sugar cookie and brioche in this sparkling blend of Chardonany, Pinot Noir, Cayuga and Pinot Gris. It's zesty in lemon-lime acidity, finishing rich and dense.",US-New York:Sparkling Blend
"This is a delicious ripe wine, full of black fruits and with generous tannins. Mint flavors come from the new wood aging and enhance the ripe berry flavors and acidity. Drink this structured wine from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Dark and bloody, this masterfully mixes layer upon layer of detail. Red meat, black olive, cassis and earth roll across the tongue, while hints of flower and chocolate linger in the nose. Complex, tart and earthy, this is as good as it gets in this price range.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Aromas of scorched earth, leather, vanilla, spiced plum and grilled herb take shape in the glass. The warm palate offers dried black cherry and licorice alongside extremely astringent tannins. This is aging preciously and the fruit is already dried up, which makes the warmth of alcohol noticeable on the close.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"With a taste of fresh blueberry cobbler and pie crust, this well-made wine is from the producer's mountainous estate. Powerful yet soft, it offers further concentrated flavors of cinnamon, clove and smoke, with just a touch of violet on the nose.",US-California:Petit Verdot
"This 100% Touriga Nacional comes from the government-owned estate in the north of Tejo. Named after the barn owl that is found in the woods, the wine is structured with dense tannins as well as concentrated black fruits. It is balanced with its fruit and structure already working well together, but it will need time. Drink from 2019.",Portugal-Tejo:Touriga Nacional
"A blend of classic Douro white grapes, this is a perfumed, textured wine. Still young, it shows green fruits, sliced apples and a lemon-zest aftertaste. With all its acidity, the wine needs to calm down a little, so drink from late 2017.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese White
"Aromas of toasted oak, espresso, coconut and dried black fruit slowly take shape in the glass. Made entirely with Merlot, the dense palate offers blackberry extract, black cherry, coffee and grilled sage alongside rather astringent tannins that dry out the finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Merlot
"Nicely layered, this offers an intensity of black plum and chocolate around a soft core of approachable, rounded tannins. Medium bodied, it has a mix of elegance and decadence that makes it drinkable now and impressive from start to finish.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"One of the most familiar of Puligny's Premier Crus has produced a ripe, yet very structured wine. It has intense minerality and a nervy, tight texture balanced with acidity, crisp apple and attractive wood spice. Everything is in harmony on this complex wine, promising a smooth aging . Drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"In line with this winery's penchant for oak, this fast-aging wine is buttery and heavily toasted. As a result, snappy apple or citrus fruit is harder to find than many might want it to be. Nevertheless, there's some bold lemon and creamy vanilla on the thick, mouthfilling palate. And for that, it earns points.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"This famous site was planted in 1972 by Dick Erath, and the 44-year-old vines deliver an aromatic, elegant yet substantive bottle of Pinot. It's a complex mix of wild berries, cherries and chocolate, showing the generous flavors of the vintage. Delicious already, it's got the power and presence to age gracefully through 2023.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Zesty lemon and lime, with honey and blossom notes permeate this ethereally delicate semisweet Riesling. Despite it's diminutive frame, it's concentrated in citrus and stone fruit flavors. Finishes long on a honeyed saffron note.",Germany-Rheinhessen:Riesling
"Still settling into the bottle, this wine is aromatically quiet, with notes of white flowers and pear. It drinks off dry, with generous amounts of stone-fruit flavors. If the aromas blossom, it could move up a notch as the flavors are quite well proportioned.",US-Washington:Riesling
"New leather, truffle, sun-baked soil, menthol and grilled herb aromas practically jump out of the glass. The big, chewy palate delivers mature wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice and tobacco notes, set against a backdrop of firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2020–2027.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"The intensity of this powerhouse Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot blend is outstanding, and so is the density of its aromas. It presents a solid wall of blackberry, dark chocolate, pipe tobacco and cigar box. It's bold and syrupy and overwhelms the palate with its enormous bounty.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Veramonte knows how to capture the pungent, alert character inherent to Sauvignon Blanc. This is a peppy wine with spiky tropical and green-fruit aromas and flavors. It's a mash up of citrus and nettles, with a controlled, fairly long grapefruit-driven finish. Modest in price, but the realthing.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"A nice selection for poolside entertaining, this bright and accessible Chenin Blanc offers attractive aromas and flavors of guava, melon and orange marmalade that are balanced by vibrant acidity. Ripe and flavorful without being overdone.",South Africa-Western Cape:Chenin Blanc
"This blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 21% Syrah, 7% Grenache, 6% Petit Verdot, 5% Tannat and 1% Viognier is tightly wound but likely to improve with time. Opened now, it offers elderberry, black currant, pencil lead and loam on the nose, with lava rock, crème de cassis and kirsch flavors slowing emerging on the palate.",US-California:Red Blend
"Fermented 75% whole-cluster and then aged in neutral oak, this wine offers complex, expressive aromas of green olive, fresh herbs, grilled asparagus, earth and peat. The palate brings waves of intensity, with sensuous, layered savory flavors that lead to a hyperextended finish. It's an exclamation point of a wine that shows the promise of this young winery and vineyard.",US-Washington:Syrah
"This is a bright fruit-driven wine, with clean and refreshing flavors. All stainless fermented, it's got a sharp, tangy finish, that will cut through rich creamy sauces.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"Berry, cassis and cola aromas are bold and stout. This Garnacha feels full and clampy. Plum, blackberry and leathery flavors are strong and secure, and the wine finishes in composed fashion, with rubbery, chewy tannins.",Spain-Northern Spain:Garnacha
"This is a deliciously fruity wine, packed with red berry fruits, strawberries and fresh raspberries. While fresh and crisp, there is decent roundness to the palate. Drink now.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"90-92 Barrel sample. Firm tannins, but also ripe, sweet fruits, with a fine balance. While the wine is on the light, fresh side, it does have a good, final structure.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a wonderful edition to Pearl, Sparkman's 100% Sauvignon Blanc. It's vibrant and energetic, the kind of high-wire flavors more commonly found in Sancerre. Three days after it was first tasted, the wine was still drinking beautifully, with candied mixed fruits and terrific concentration.",US-Washington:Sauvignon Blanc
"Dense, intense, concentrated and young, this wine is one for the cellar. It has tight aromas of cranberry, dried cherry and cardamom, while flavors offer ripe fruit character and a firm texture of fine-grained tannins. It should gain more complexity and smoothness after 2022.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This spicy, medium-bodied wine is heavily sprinkled with cinnamon and nutmeg aromas. It tucks layers of red cherry and raspberry into the flavors while soothing the palate with a velvety, easy-to-sip texture.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is funky up front, with aromas of Russian dressing and briny citrus. The mouthfeel is chunky and foamy, while the flavor profile runs heavy and sweet, with candied citrus and molasses notes. A weighty finish tastes of brown sugar.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
Thick tannins gird the powerful fruit in this wine—a mix of red cherry and strawberry that mellows with time in the glass. Toasted oak and baking spice touches provide additional context and pleasure.,US-California:Pinot Noir
"Gavin Chanin's wines manage to pack a stunning array of elements behind a veil of restraint, here showing sea salt, lemon skins, struck flint and smoked nectarine on the nose. The palate is alkaline and botanical in presentation, offering lime skin, chalk, dried butter flakes, cement and a salty acidity. The wine tastes like foggy sunshine.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Light and fresh, this is an apple-crisp wine with delicious acidity and a refreshing lemon tang. A finely textured character gives shape to the wine and supports the crunchy fruit. Drink this wine now.",France-Loire Valley:Melon
"Made in an exotic style that will divide purists into opposing camps. It's dark, rich and almost heavy, with the weight of a Grenache. Yet it's utterly delicious, dazzling in wild raspberry and cherry essence, thyme, cola, pie spice and sandalwood flavors. A fascinating wine that should do interesting things in the cellar.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is one of the most exciting wines of the vintage for this label, a blend of 68% Bien Nacido and 32% from its sister vineyard, Solomon Hills. It shows Meyer lemon pith, chalk, pencil lead, grapefruit pith and a slight touch of yogurt on the nose. The chalk-driven, tingling-with-acidity palate opens onto brine-laced flavors of yellow grapefruit pith and expertly restrained pineapple and peach.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Stewed strawberries, blackberry jam, maple, brown sugar, black pepper, teriyaki and pork fat show on the lush nose of this bargain bottling. It's soft on the palate, with fruity strawberry and ripe plum flavors, as well as some more serious beef char elements. It's fun, easy and delicious.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Right off the bat, this Pinot impresses for sheer depth of fruity flavor. It's rich and showy with plums and cherries, spicy notes of tobacco and pine, and toasty, new oak. The tannin-acid structure is impeccably balanced. Delicious to drink now, but should also mature beautifully. A majority of the grapes come from the winery's Wayfarer Vineyard, in the new Fort Ross-Seaview appellation.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This wine is firm, with extracted tannins that give a bitter, dark-chocolate edge. Underneath await black fruits, acidity and a crisper edge. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese Red
"The aromas are a little sweaty and the wine has not entirely knit together, even after four years. Fruit flavors are raisined, the acids feel chalky, and the finish resolves into some bitter phenolics.",US-Oregon:Cabernet Franc
"This is a fine value and actually a pretty nice Merlot. Dry and soft, it has very attractive flavors of cherries, cocoa, pepper and mint, and finishes with a nice, sweet touch of smoky vanilla.",US-California:Merlot
"Not a bad price for a Sauvignon Blanc of this interest. You'll find a burst of pine-apple, lemongrass, fig and vanilla honey flavors, with the dryness and scoury acidity you want in this variety. Partial barrel fermentation adds a creamy richness to this polished wine.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Red in color, with berry and apple aromas, this is sweet, with a heavy body and light effervescence.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"Made in the classic Clos du Val style, this Cabernet is less ripe, drier and more acidic than many of its Napa Valley neighbors. It's also very tannic. Currently, it's an aloof, austere wine, but it has a deep core of blackberries. This wants at least eight years in a proper cellar, and should age well for another decade beyond that.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"It's rare to see a varietal bottle of Chardonnay from this appellation. This one comes from Birch Creek Vineyard and has alluring aromas of lees, almond, peach and straw. The creamy stone-fruit flavors have a sense of richness but are also quite deft, with a finish that lingers.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"While showing sweetness, this wine also manages to retain great freshness. It's delicious, with bright green plum fruitiness as well as weight and richness. It will be a great food wine, but wait until 2018.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"Fresh white grapefruit and tea leaves perfume this gorgeously honeyed kabinett. The palate is just delicately sweet, glazed by honey and sweet-tart tangerine flavors. Juicy in concentration yet finely filigreed on the tongue, it's an elegant yet approachable wine with wide appeal. Drink now through 2020.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"Bold and ripe, this offers aromas of crushed blue flower, ripe plum, mocha and exotic spice. The opulent, firmly structured palate doles out black cherry, blackberry jam, licorice, oak and a hint of coconut alongside tightly knit, fine-grained tannins.",Italy-Veneto:Red Blend
"There's not much Chardonnay grown on Howell Mountain, but here's one to check out. It has an unusually pungent earthiness, leading to rich flavors of yellow apricots, lemon tart and kumquats, with a complex touch of mushroom. Bone dry and crisp, it should develop bottle complexities over the next 5–6 years.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This is pure Cabernet that was sourced from four vineyards, with vines averaging 31 years. True noninterventionist winemaking is in play to make this chewy, tight and dark effort.This is grainy and dense, with notes of cassis, coffee and cacao. A thread of smoke and a touch of gravel contribute further to the concentrated finish.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Blackberries, violet and black-slate aromas mix with a bit of soy sauce on this blend of 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Mourvèdre and 18% Grenache, grown in what today is known as the San Miguel District of Paso Robles. Juicy flavors of black raspberry and licorice combine for an easy-quaffing palate.",US-California:Red Blend
"Dark-skinned berry, exotic spice, blue flower and wild herb aromas take center stage in this Barolo. Full-bodied and loaded with finesse, the taut, precise palate offers juicy red cherry, cranberry, star anise and clove flavors framed by firm, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. Drink 2023–2033.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"For one of their lower-priced bottlings, this blend of 55% Grenache, 40% Mourvèdre and 5% Cinsault is a great deal. The nose shows exuberant black raspberry, scarlet rose petals and fresh lilacs against a backdrop of dewy thyme and oregano. That herbal component carries strongly to the palate, giving nuance to tangy plum fruits. The savory touch would pair with everything from pasta to Asian-spiced beef.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"This off-dry Riesling's honey-kissed peach and nectarine flavors are lip-smackingly sweet. Its light, sprightly texture and high-toned acidity lend balance and refreshment. Brisk and easy-drinking, it offers loads of quaffable appeal.",Germany-Nahe:Riesling
"Patz & Hall has captured the cool-climate essence of southern Sonoma Chard with this dry, crisply acidic, and vibrantly fruity young wine. Might have benefitted from less new oak though, because the caramel and toast seem a little excessive.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Both opulence and decadence are evident on the fleshy, peachy nose. The palate presents brighter, fresher peach and yellow plum fruit but has the sweetness of bitter honey. An intriguing and heady mix.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"From a section of the producer's Quail Hill Vineyard, this wine sings with smoky sage and forest floor notes, its tingling acidity emphasizing freshness. Its backbone of thick tannins offers strength and power, contrasting more delicate layers of blueberry flavor.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Very structured, this wood-aged wine is showing more tannin than fruit. Smoky, burnt flavors dominate a wine that is all tannin and dry texture. Only the juicy acidity at the end suggests potential.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This blend comes from seven vineyards: John Sebastiano, Shadow Canyon, Thompson, Harrison Clarke, Watch Hill and Stolpman. Melded with 10% Grenache and 1% Viognier, it shows warm gingerbread and blackberry aromas, cut by pencil lead and anise. The flavors expertly balance ripeness with tannins and acidity, offering dynamic ollallieberry, pepper-crusted roast pork, wild herbs and a touch of vanilla on the finish.",US-California:Syrah
"This is a bone dry, tannic, rather austere wine. It has suggestions of cherry skins and red licorice, with brisk acidity. Not an ager, it needs rich, fatty meats and cheeses for balance.",US-California:Cabernet Franc
"Sigalas sets the bar high for Assyrtiko as usual. This 2010 is a balance of rounded citrus, crisp sea salt and sparkling minerality. Delicious with grilled fish, fruit or alone on a hot day, this is an elegant gem of a white that represents some of the best of Greek wine offered today.",Greece-Santorini:Assyrtico
"As the name Barriques suggests, this wine is lightly aged in wood that adds toast to spice and gives a buttery, ripe texture. The wine is fresh, rounded with a pepper character that comes through strongly at the end. Drink now, but better from 2016.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"A rush of blueberry introduces this exceptional Malbec. Pure and deep, it is streaked with bark, iron, clove and dark chocolate. Impressively long and focused, this has the structure and balance to develop further in the bottle. But as a young wine, it is already delicious and utterly seductive.",US-Washington:Malbec
"Named for the documentary filmmaker, artist and wife of Francis Ford Coppola, Eleanor blends Syrah and Petite Sirah from Rutherford with Cabernet Sauvignon from Alexander Valley and Syrah from Dry Creek Valley to form a rich, red, extracted wine generously succulent in cranberry and dark cherry. Licorice, tar and tobacco add to the complexity and flavor.",US-California:Red Blend
"Hard tannins, dryness and oakiness are the three horsemen that mark this young, vital Cabernet. Is it ageworthy? Absolutely. Once the fruit kicks in, which is pretty much instantly, it's devastatingly rich and spicy in blackberries, blueberries and cassis. Clearly a cellar candidate for at least the next decade.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine starts broody and dusty, with dark cherry, mocha, and woody notes. The palate feels a little hot and at the moment the tannins are huge, tightly wound, and overpowering. The pretty cherry notes are eventually revealed again with time in the glass.",New Zealand-Martinborough:Pinot Noir
"This blend of Catarratto and Chardonnay shows a tiny touch of oxidation, with butterscotch and caramel aromas behind candied fruit, apricot and pineapple. The mouthfeel is soft, thick and sticky.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:White Blend
"This is a doughy, dusty wine, the tannins provocative in length and grip. Blackberry, chocolate and graphite swirl around a ripe center, the texture smooth and firm. On the finish is a steady back beat of oak.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Compact and chewy, with clearly delineated Bordeaux style and character. Cassis and black cherry fruit; stiff, earthy tannins, good length and fine aging potential. The acids and tannins are in good proportion, and the fruit is not overtaken with new oak, but there is enough (40%) to frame it with some sweet spices.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Scents of tropical of mango and banana are offset by a hint of citrus. Creamy and soft on the palate, this tastes of lime and green herbs. A banana flavor carries the finish.",Chile-Central Valley:Chardonnay
"An enticing, heavy-duty blend of 40% Viognier, 40% Petit Manseng and 20% Roussanne, this is rich, round and unctuous, with bold notes of golden stone fruit, orange Creamsicle, lemon tartlet and caramelized nut. The acidity is soft across the midpalate, but it brightens on the warm, medium-length finish. To appreciate the full spectrum of aromas and flavors, don't drink this too cold.",US-Virginia:White Blend
"This is a full-bodied and full-flavored wine with rich and deep aromas, ripe fruit flavors and a texture that feels substantial but polished. It starts with black cherry and woodsy aromas, then goes to lively but broad cherry, plum and nutmeg notes. The finish stays flavorful and dry.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Pontin scores with a sweet, lemony, ripe mouthful of fresh and fruity Riesling. Shows the verve and juicy deliciousness of Yakima Valley fruit.",US-Washington:Riesling
Wonderfully concentrated notes of ripe mirabelle plums open up on the nose. There also is a heady lemon note. The palate is rich with the same fleshy ripe fruit but has a fault line of zesty orange at its core that provides focus and seems to illuminate clouds of ripe aromatic citrus at every turn. This shimmers with tangerine and clementine. The body is immensely concentrated but has total direction and drive. Enjoy 2020–2040.,Austria-Wachau:Riesling
"Among the producer's most luxurious offerings, this nearly 100% varietal wine (with 2% Petit Verdot) is grippy in tobacco and big, pillowy tannin. The leaner side of its personality is defined by classic notions of cedar, currant and graphite, while its other aspect reveals riper elements of mountain blackberry and chocolate mocha. They all work well together in sync.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Here's a wood-aged wine, with peach and pineapple flavors and a rich, round mouthfeel. It has a lighter side, with ample, crisp acidity and the poise of the white wines of 2012. You could drink it now, but better to wait until 2014.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Firm and with dark tannins, this wine has great potential. Ripe berry fruits and a concentrated structure are already well balanced with acidity cutting through. As it matures, this wine with its dense structure will develop well. Drink from 2017. Enologist Sebastien and vineyard manager Nicolas are the latest Carreau generation managing family estates.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Powerful, rich and chunky wine. It has the ripest jammy plum and crushed strawberry fruit, along with a serious tannic structure. Just approaching drinkability, its texture is now refreshed with delicious fruit.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"This least expensive of Sterling's latest Merlots stands up respectfully beside the winery's more expensive bottlings, which makes it a good buy. It's very dry, tannic and elegantly structured, with cherry and blackberry flavors enriched with sweet smoky oak.",US-California:Merlot
"Built a little more sturdily than some NZ Pinots, Rockburn's 2007 shows fine intensity and purity of black cherry flavors, allied to hints of mushroom, earth and cola. It's full-bodied, with a long, supple finish. Drink now–2015.",New Zealand-Central Otago:Pinot Noir
"This ripe, crisp and intensely fruity wine does have a touch of tannin, inevitable with Cabernet Franc, but it is really all about red fruits and refreshing acidity. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley:Rosé
"Here's an elegant and powerful wine from the deep south of Italy that cries out for a pairing with succulent steak or an aged cheese such as pecorino. Despite its blunt power and firm tannins, the wine delivers pretty complexity in the form of black currant, prune, slate and tobacco aromas.",Italy-Southern Italy:Aglianico
"A nice bottle of wine, bone-dry and fragrant, with pleasing, simple flavors.",US-Washington:Chenin Blanc
"Ripe, luscious raspberries lend a brambly tone to this dry, invigorating Pinot Noir rosé. The palate is concentrated with summer berry flavors pierced with a stream of tart lemonade acidity.",US-New York:Rosé
"With its wire caged bottle, the wine appears as though it is Spanish. The flavors, though, are all Portuguese. Dominated by Touriga Nacional's distinctive perfumed and dry tannin character, with the addition of the powerfully juicy Alicante Bouschet, the wine is dark, solid and still coming together. It is concentrated and rich, shot through with acidity. Drink from 2017.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"This is dry and brisk in acidity, with firm tannins and great structural integrity. At the same time, it's vast in blackberry and cherry-jam flavors, while the oak overlay is strong but perfectly matched with the wine's volume. Very fine, complex and elegant, this is a Cabernet to cellar for eight years; it could be one for the long haul.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made with organically farmed grapes, this opens with pretty aromas of crushed rose, violet, perfumed berry, leather, truffle and a balsamic note. The warm palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, stewed plum, cake spice, anisette and savory herb alongside velvety tannins. It closes on a licorice note and the heat of evident alcohol. Drink 2018–2025.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This starts off with scents of melon and wet stone. A sense of plumpness unfolds on the attack, then accelerates across the palate in a burst of bright, citrusy acids. A tactile, silky edge to the finish adds length and complexity.",Australia-South Australia:Riesling
"Made with Sangiovese and small amounts of Malvasia Nera, Colorino, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of dark-skinned fruit, fragrant purple flower and dark culinary spice. Bright and juicy, the easygoing palate doles out succulent wild cherry, cinnamon and clove set against supple tannins. Drink through 2019.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Aromas of clamshell, tree bark and berry fruits are scattereshot. This has a noticeably sticky, syrupy feel along with candied, sweet flavors of black plum and baking spices. A chunky, sticky, sweet-tasting finish lacks cut and finesse.",Chile-Central Valley:Pinot Noir
"Midnight purple in color, this has legs as thick as an elephant's. It smells like boysenberry jam, spice and bacon, then feels like motor oil on the palate, with flavors of black fruit, chocolate and boysenberry syrup. It lacks complexity, but it hits hard with concentration, power and sweetness.",Spain-Levante:Monastrell
"Ripe and full, it offers great spice, yellow fruits and hints of tropical fruits. It has acidity and is dry, but it's delicious because of its rounded texture and generous body. Drink from 2015.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"Firm and solid, this is a wine marked by blackberries, solid and dense tannins. The concentration will bring all the elements together to give an important wine, while never losing the 2008 acidity.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Good, solid fruit flavors fill out this light-colored but full-bodied Grenache. It has ripe plum, tart cherry and cedar nuances; a broad, firm texture helps flavors linger on the finish. It's the kind of wine that tastes better with each sip.",US-California:Grenache
"This Amarone has somewhat rustic aromas that recall animal and meat juices. You'll also detect whiffs of burned rubber. The palate is better, showing ripe fruit and smooth tannins. While the fruit is delicious and immediate, this also reflects the heat of the vintage and is shy on fresh acidity.",Italy-Veneto:Red Blend
"A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Bianco, this has a delicate fragrance of white flower and orchard fruit. The vibrant palate offers yellow apple, citrus and a touch of mineral while crisp acidity provides the framework.",Italy-Tuscany:White Blend
"Dramatic oaky aromas and flavors, like nutmeg, butter and vanilla, create an attention-grabbing profile in this full-bodied, moderately tannic wine. It has solid fruit as well, but that character plays second fiddle.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This is a very pleasant Barbera from the Monferrato zone with good concentration and bright aromas of blueberry, wild fruit, wet earth and hazelnut. There's good dimension here as well as a smooth texture that is accented by the wine's natural acidity.",Italy-Piedmont:Barbera

"Plenty of tannins give this wine a firm and dense structure, but it also shows the potential of black-currant fruit flavors and perfumed acidity. Give this wine time and drink from 2019. Spring and fall weather in 2013 forced Marie-José (Perrin) Lerichecut to reduce production to 20% of an average year.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a ripe, fruit-forward wine. It has black currant and some attractive acidity. It seems to miss out on the structure and firm texture that would be expected from a Douro wine, so it is possible to drink now.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"Heavy oak greets you on the nose in the form of shoe polish and blackened aromas. This feels ripe, solid and woody, with good structure. Flavors of plum, mint and oak resin turn spicy and minty if given time, while the finish is driven by crisp acidity and plum and raspberry flavors.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"At this early stage of the wine's evolution, it shows some slightly pungent, sweaty notes, but they're balanced by ample ripe passion fruit aromas and flavors. It's medium in weight, with an attractively structured mouthfeel, and a bright, lengthy finish that echoes with grapefruit.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"Melon, mango and papaya aromas are tropical and lead to a smooth, creamy palate with sweet orange, melon and baking spice flavors. Nothing is complicated or edgy; this is standard Verdejo that's easy to drink.",Spain-Northern Spain:Verdejo
"Dark in appearance, with reduced, grapy, inky aromas, this compact Carmenère nearly collapses under its own weight. Heavily toasted blackberry flavors finish stout, with blackened spice notes. If there's a knock on this blockbuster, it's that it lacks layering and elegance.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Carmenère
"Young, fruity and with potential, this is a perfumed while also structured wine. It has plenty of black-currant flavors as well as delicious acidity. The dry core keeps the fruitiness together. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Don't look for this new producer to remain under the radar for long; this is the third successive vintage featuring beautifully crafted, distinctive wines. The Red Mountain fruit has that region's stony minerality. Immaculate, tart red currant and cherry flavors, still tight and young, are wrapped with lightly toasty notes from barrel aging.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"From the historic family-owned vineyard down a ways on Westside Road, this Bacigalupi wine is richer and more layered than some of the producer's other vineyard-designates, providing a meatier, more tropical edge of fleshy butter and nuttiness. The aromatics balance things out, sharing whispers of orange blossom and caramel.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This bone-dry high-acid wine puts flavors of grapefruit flesh and rind front and center. It's a no-fuss summer sipper, perhaps not quite as rich as previous vintages, or maybe just exceptionally young. It's tangy, fresh and focused.",US-Oregon:Rosé
"Old vines always add some concentration to a wine, and this firm and dark wine is no exception. It's also juicy and fruity with a full character that is already attractive but should age well over 4–5 years.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"This blend of 26% Viognier, 25% Grenache Blanc, 25% Marsanne and 24% Roussanne manages to be both lush and light, showing candied melon, clover honey, pretty green pear and lime-butter on the nose. The palate offers Gala apples and fresh lemon zest, yet retains and intriguingly savory quality throughout the sip.",US-California:Rhône-style White Blend
"This basic, inexpensive Pinot has Syrah and Viognier blended, but overall the wine is fairly generic, with a streak of smokiness in the background.",US-California:Pinot Noir
Wood aromas provide a toasty character that dominates the fruit. It will take time for the apple and pear fruit flavors to show. Drink from 2020.,France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Mossy, furry, leafy black fruit aromas are a reasonably good opening. Feels upright and alert, with bright acidity. Flavors of plum and berry blend with chocolate, herbs and spice in front of a grabby, slightly clacky finish.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Merlot
"This savory wine begins with aromas of peach blossom and citrus. The linear palate delivers golden apple, lemon zest, nectarine and almond alongside bright acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Ribolla Gialla
"Always one of the best quality-for-value wines in Italy, this classic Barbaresco delivers quintessential Nebbiolo sensations of rose, black cherry, red berry, cinnamon and a hint of leather. It's friendly, with firm, round tannins and just enough fresh acidity. Drink now–2020.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Generous and mouthfilling, this is a medium- to full-bodied wine with fruity aromas. Rich cherry, spice and earth flavors partner with a firm texture and a lingering, slightly tannic finish. While showing a lot of fruit up front, this wine will also age well for a few years; best to drink after 2018.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Powdery, soapy aromas are exotic but not fully convincing. Fresh but nothing more than wet and basic on the palate, this shows briny flavors of orange rind through the finish.",Argentina-Other:Torrontés
"93-95 Barrel sample. With an higher proportion of Merlot than is usual even at Palmer, this wine, goes for lovely fresh, soft fruits. There is a touch of spice, juicy red berries, finally getting to a depth of dusty, chewy tannins.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"In this structured wine, aromas recall meat juices, black plum, bell pepper and cooking spices. The dense palate delivers fleshy black cherry and black currant accented by black pepper, clove and espresso. Still young, it has brooding tannins that need time to tame. Drink 2016–2023.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Fermented and aged in large French and Austrian casks, this single vineyard Pinot Grigio opens with aromas that recall oak, yellow apple and candied citrus peel. The round palate offers white peach, vanilla pear, apple and lemon drop alongside racy acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Grigio
"92-94 Ripe blackcurrants, powerful fruit, with great acidity and enticing dusty tannins. The wine brings out juicy Merlot flavors, with a more concentrated element.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Fermented in neutral French oak barrels and allowed to mature on its lees for eight months, this Viognier is expressive of toasty, flaky piecrust, papaya, melon and a touch of turmeric. It shows some viscosity on the palate, with an almost oily texture, but the bright acids are invigorating, driving the wine to a nutty finish.",US-Virginia:Viognier
"This is a soft wine, ripe with apricot and melon flavors. It shows the warmth of the vintage, round and gently fruity. Almonds and a tangy aftertaste give a crisp finish.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"The bottle that changed Italian wine forever, Tignanello is as modern and innovative as its first vintage many decades ago. Soft blackberry and cherry is backed by balanced spice, leather and toasted espresso. Those rich oak tones do a wonderful job of holding up the wine's natural richness and velvety smoothness. Hold 10 years or more.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"A fascinatingly flavorful wine by South African Ernst Storm, this shows very perfumed apple peels, pungent green pears and telltale grass shavings on the nose, all lifted by white pepper, wet thyme and hints of dried peaches. The incredibly vibrant palate, with lots of energy and acidity yet not in a biting way, offers flavors of rainy cement, limestone, Granny Smith apple skins and more grass.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Delicate scents of elderflower and orchard fruit mix in the glass while the lively palate offers rennet apple, citrus zest and a whiff of nutmeg. Crisp acidity brightens the juicy flavors.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Müller-Thurgau

"There is a fine mineral texture to this structured, firm wine from the northern Haut-Médoc. It also has ripe fruit and a richly tannic character, with flavors of black plum juice and berry. Dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, this will age over several years.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Falls off a notch from the '07, with tart acidity and sweet oak dominating. The depth just isn't there, although it's certainly a fine wine. Tastes like buttered cinnamon toast spread with raspberry jam and sprinkled with white pepper and cocoa.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"88—90 Barrel sample. A wine with a high wood content, maybe too much – the question is over the fruit's ability to stand up to the blast of wood. The result is a wine that is super-spicy.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"With three acres out of 36 in this Grand Cru, Faiveley is one of the larger proprietors. The wine is firm and structured with solid tannins, while black fruits give acidity and freshness to this massive wine. Drink from 2020.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Round aromas of chocolate-covered raisin set up a loaded palate. Salty berry, cassis, baking-spice and chocolate flavors finish with a full helping of berry and plum fruit, while this maintains a moderately full outlook on the finish. Drink through 2021.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"A Blanc de Noirs uses only black grapes and can be powerful with a tannic edge. That's the case here, the wine full of citrus zest, an apple-skin texture and a tight and tannic feel. A real food Champagne.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Hugely ripe, with 14.5% alcohol and a touch of residual sweetness, but also a richly textured mouthfeel and layers of honey, apricot preserves, slate-driven minerality and spice. It may be a bit precariously balanced, so opt for drinking it over the near term.",Germany-Rheingau:Riesling
"This extremely sweet wine tastes of rich, seductive honey. The underlying fruit suggests extremely ripe apricots, peaches, pineapples and vanilla. It's all balanced with fine acidity.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon
"Dry oak, black fruit and floral notes suggestive of violet are the aromas that set off this tannic, clamping, deeply structured Malbec. Flavors of mocha, maple, savory blackberry and roasted plum end with a mix of creaminess and strapping tannins. Drink through 2025.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Still young, this wine has considerable acidity that is surprising. Its cherry fruits are fresh with soft tannins and a juicy aftertaste. It needs another six months to calm down. Drink from summer 2016.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"This is a superripe wine. With its apricot and mango fruit flavors it is exotic and far removed from traditional white Bordeaux. A blend of Sauvignons Blanc and Gris, it has light signs of wood aging that add some spice to the very rich character of the wine. Drink from the end of 2016.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"A favorite within Fox Run's unique geology wine series, an exploration of specific vineyard terroir against specific vinification styles, the 11 Lake Dana Vineyard offers a lovely balance between rustic earth elements and more pristine expressions of fruit and flower. Concentrated tangerine and lemon flavors are honeyed and sweet yet elegantly balanced by tones of black tea, blossom and smoked nut. The finish lingers on a pleasantly astringent note.",US-New York:Riesling
"Using the all-too-confusing “extra dry” designation for a rather sweet sparkling wine seems unnecessary for this re-named wine with spiffy new packaging. The blend is 63% Chardonnay, 19% Pinot Noir and 18% Pinot Gris; the flavors are a mix of citrus rind and crystalized sugar. The finish, despite the sweetness, is slightly bitter.",US-Washington:Sparkling Blend
"A bouquet of summer desserts—strawberry soup, apricot pie and lemon meringue pie—pull you into the glass. Although not quite as nuanced, the palate delivers enticing apricot and wet stone notes. The unctuous palate and noticeable residual sugar will partner well with fish in an Asian-fusion preparation.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"A little tough and gritty, but okay for everyday fare. Shows blackberry, currant, tobacco and herb flavors that turn sweetly fruity on the finish.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Earth and rubber notes on the bouquet give way to black fruit and black olive aromas. It feels fresh, with a good acid level and a solid body supporting flavors of wild berry, plum and spice. The finish is toasty, with a fair amount of oak and bacon flavors.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Crushed red berry, black plum, prune, game and baking spice aromas carry on to the palate, along with dense black cherry and mocha. It's warm, soft and evolving fast so enjoy now.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This wine surprises by being so very pretty—unexpected from such a hot site. Lovely scents of raspberry, strawberry, mint and spice lift the nose; the palate is medium-bodied, nicely tart, perfectly balanced and long. The mix of sweet and tart red fruits lasts deliciously, with the spice adding grace notes. Though blended and aged in 100% new French oak barrels, the oak is muted, and the fruit shines through.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This drinks like a Port, with extremely ripe and definitely sweet flavors of raisins, dried plums and blackberry jam. It's not so much a dinner wine as something to sip around the campfire or with a dark chocolate dessert.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Gritty and harsh, with tart acidity framing flavors of sour cherry candy and cola.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"The wine is young, which explains the intense acidity and flavors of currants as well as citrus. It is right up front with its fruitiness. Bright acidity shines through and gives the wine delicious, ready-to-drink character.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine's oaky entry derives from 10 months aging in French and American oak. It's creamy and voluptuous in style, with simple flavors of apple and a moderately long finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Aromas of berry fruit, wet cement and chewing gum struggle to make their case. This feels sticky and confected, while flavors of candied berry, mint and spicy oak finish with herbal notes and sweetness.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This bright Fiano is very well put together, with a tight, linear mouthfeel that is backed by opulent aromas of pear, white peach, crushed mineral and lemon zest. A very fresh, food-friendly wine.",Italy-Southern Italy:Fiano
"Soft, with slightly dilute flavors of blackberry and currant, surrounded by oak. Turns vegetal as it opens.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Punchy citric aromas come with a note of fresh celery. This is zesty and crisp in the mouth, while orange and celery stalk flavors end with a refreshing, cleansing finish.",Chile-Leyda Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Briny pithy citrus aromas and a standard-feeling palate tell you this is regular but solidly made. Citrus flavors are largely ripe, while pithy grapefruit notes are found on the finish. Drink now.",Chile-Curicó Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"An eccentric wine that will appeal to some with exotic tastes. The tropical fruit, Asian pear and melon flavors are drying out, reverting to cashew nuts, herbs and minerals. With crisp acidity, this Chardonnay is headed into interesting, offbeat places.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This is a lovely Morellino that delivers lively and easy aromas of cherry, blackberry and plum. As the wine is aged only in stainless steel to preserve its freshness, the integrity of the fruit is remarkable, and the mouthfeel is bright and focused.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Fresh hibiscus, black plum and smashed olallieberry meet with vibrant florality and wide range of dark spice on the nose of this blend of 70% Grenache and 30% Syrah. A pepper-laced structure releases flavors of black cherry, cola and a touch of charcoal on the well-hewn palate.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"A grassy, green wine, although with some weight and richness filling out the fresh fruitiness. It's soft, showing lemon and red apple fruits but with a crisp final taste. Screwcap.",France-Southwest France:Sauvignon Blanc
"You'll find alluring scents of black-skinned berry, baking spice, violet, a hint of leather and a balsamic note on this well-structured red. The chewy palate shows dense black cherry, raspberry compote, licorice, clove and pipe tobacco alongside velvety tannins and fresh acidity. A hint of cinnamon closes the finish. It's already approachable but also has great mid-term aging potential. Drink through 2023.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"There are both ripe yellow and pineapple fruit flavors and tight minerality in this wine. That gives it the potential to age with its structure, spice from wood and fragrant acidity. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Smooth and round in an approachable, big-boned way, this blend has moderate acidity and a grippy finish, while offering flavors of raspberry, plum, crayon and mocha.",US-California:Red Blend
"This Merlot-dominant red blend displays classic Yakima Valley flavors that are well-integrated and balanced for medium-term (6–8 years) aging. The fruit is on the tart side, with accents of earth and herb. The tannins are textural and somewhat drying.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Dark toast and char lend a spicy woodsiness to this bold, beefy Cabernet Franc. It's concentrated on the palate, with plush plum and blackberry flavors accented by savory tones of earth and animal. Finishes with a thick blanket of velvety tannins.",US-New York:Cabernet Franc
"This small, independent producer has made a rich, unctuous, mouth-filling wine, with intense fruit and honey flavors, only just hinting at the spirit. A big, ripe wine, intensely flavored.",Portugal-Port:Port
"Immensely inviting, this opens with fragrant pipe tobacco, crushed berry, new leather and pressed violet aromas. On the palate, firm, refined tannins underpin juicy black cherry, raspberry and cinnamon flavors, while orange zest accents and an energizing mineral note lift the finish. It's beautifully balanced with bright acidity and will reward a bit of cellaring. Drink 2020–2032.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This firm wine still needs to shed its youthful structure of tannin and bring out the underlying ripe fruits. It has weight, hints of juicy acidity and a medium-term potential. The end shows some of the natural concentration from old vines.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"This Merlot's soft mouthfeel and mellow tannins make it fine for everyday drinking. It has stylish flavors of cherries and red licorice, and is beginning to show its age.",US-California:Merlot
"From the grand cru village of Cramant, this 100% Chardonnay is Mumm's signature Champagne. This latest bottling is tight, taut and beautifully textured. Crisp apples, squeezed lemon and layers of acidity give a wine that is delicate, dry and well balanced. Aged for six years before disgorgement, the wine is ready to drink.",France-Champagne:Chardonnay
"A disagreeable wine, with so much oak, all you can taste is sugary butterscotch. Too bad, because there's a decent Chardonnay buried beneath.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Blackberries, anise, violets, lilacs, plum skin and vanilla show on the nose of this bottling. The palate shows lots of crushed peppercorns, tart elderberry and boysenberry fruit, and then a complex herbal array of tarragon, dried mint and bay leaf.",US-California:Syrah
"The nose on this appellation blend from a newer producer takes a bit of coaxing to come out, but eventually offers berry, mint and dark cola. The flavors are a combination of red fruit, oregano and licorice.",US-California:Syrah
"Steel is the medium and the message, meaning it's completely unoaked, with no malolactic fermentation. The flavors are spicy and bright, mixing cucumber, mint and green melon with a dash of white pepper.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"Tolosa may be the only vineyard to produce two unoaked Chardonnays in the same vintage. Their '11 Central Coast is quite good. This one, from estate Edna Valley fruit, is even better. With keen acidity and a brisk minerality, it shows complex flavors of limes, kiwis and grapefruits, and hints of riper, richer tropical fruits.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Feral earth and forest highlight a plush, lush texture of full-bodied ripeness and voluptuous personality in this wine from the famous site. Baked strawberry, raspberry and cherry meet cola and cardamom as buzzing acidity cuts through on the finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This wine is from Alain Dominique Perrin's Lagrézette estate in Cahors, although it is not labeled as such because the Cahors AOP is only red wine. Made from Malbec, it has the palest rosé color and elegant texture, with strawberry fruitiness and lively final acidity. Drink now.",France-Southwest France:Rosé
"This is a fresh-tasting, dry bubbly whose aromas and flavors are very appley, herbal and effusive, accented by hints of clove. While crisp on the first sip, it feels reasonably soft and smooth on the tongue, and the fine bubbles are easy to sip and swallow.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"Pretty aromas of blueberries and raspberries adorn the nose, leading into a palate of mixed berries and chocolate. This wine, which is in the medium- to full-bodied category, has a silky mouthfeel, ending in a fine dusting of cocoa powder.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
"Made with grapes from 50-year-old vines, this has a lush veneer of caramelized cherry lavished on top. Aromas include blueberry, leather and exotic spice; it's hard to imagine what to pair this sweet wine with other than aged cheeses.",Italy-Southern Italy:Primitivo
"Brooding aromas of barrel spice, dried herbs, cranberry and black cherry lead to ripe but in focus pit-fruit flavors that show a pleasing sense of harmony. A squeeze of firm tannins provides the frame.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a light, fruity wine with lemon and apricot flavors and a citrus tang that gives a lift. It's attractive, fresh and with a ripe, warm aftertaste.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This is a rich, well-structured Cabernet, but such are the tannins that it needs time in the cellar. The cool vintage was kind to the Calistoga fruit, keeping the alcohol modest and the tannins hefty, while allowing the grapes to develop intense flavors of blackberry and black currant. Give it 6–8 years in a good cellar.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A tantalizing  wine, at once rigid and austere, then yielding and generous. It's pale in color, with earthy smells of sun-warmed red brick, dust and an elusive hint of black cherry. Remarkably light in the mouth, like air, with silky tannins. Firm acids scream out for Italian food. —S.H.",US-California:Sangiovese

"This Chardonnay showcases Edna Valley's signature intensely pure varietal flavors, yet the winemaker's interventions, of oak barrel aging and sur lie influence adding complexity. It's delicious with flavors of lemon curd, pineapples, guavas, nectarines, vanilla and buttered toast.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Gold in color, this is a mature wine interesting for its roasted almond and spice flavors, very ripe and rich. Drink this full-bodied wine now.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"This is classic, ripe and creamy Alvarinho. It has a mineral edge to keep the boisterous yellow fruits and ripe perfumed flavors in order. The wine is ready to drink, full of fruit and freshness.",Portugal-Vinho Verde:Alvarinho
"This is barrel fermented, with noticeable flavors of heavily buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel flavors. Bright with crisp acidity, it also features notes of ripe pineapple, pear, peach and mango.",US-California:Chardonnay

"Intense aromas of white spring flower, aromatic herb, exotic fruit and citrus seamlessly come together on this. The radiant, precise palate offers nectarine zest, lime, sage and white peach while a tangy saline note closes the lingering finish. Enjoy now or hold another few years for more complexity. Drink through 2020.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:White Blend

"The three grapes (castas) are Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. The blend makes a satisfyingly structured wine with some firm tannins as well as ripe fruitiness. Drink now.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese Red
"There are lots of ripe, heady flavors of blackberry, dark chocolate, anise and exotic spice in this high alcohol wine. While it's a bit heavy by itself, it needs food to perk it up and coax out the richness. Grilled beef in almost any form is ideal.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Perfumed and off dry, this rich wine has spice, structure and a floral character. It is so young with its white fruits, hint of lychee and lime-juice acidity. The wine needs to age to reveal its potential. Drink from 2018.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"This is a medium-dry wine that has more spice than sweetness. It is warm and full in the mouth, and accented with a touch of pepper, brisk acidity and lychee flavors. The wine is rich and ready to drink. Screwcap.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"Pricey, but it's a very good Sauvignon Blanc. You can tell right away that it's pedigreed, from the perfumed aroma to the complex flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, sweet hay, vanilla, toast and white pepper. With a dry finish, it's versatile across a range of foods.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Benefiting from the ripe 2009 vintage, this is an intense and concentrated wine, full of jammy plum and red berry flavors, spiced with licorice and pepper. The wine has good concentration. Ready to drink now or age 3–5 years.",France-Southwest France:Red Blend
"A rich, polished Cabernet. Doesn't taste particularly Oakville-like, due to extreme ripeness, softness, high alcohol and refined tannins that could come from anywhere, but it's well crafted and delicious. Offers waves of blackberries, black currants, chocolate and cedar. Now–2013.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"From the coastal Tuscan estate of Lodovico Antinori (brother of Piero), here comes a gorgeous blend of Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc, Merlot and a small percentage of Petit Verdot. Soft chocolate and black cherry opens the nose and segues to enormous richness and length. The wine is excellent but the jury is out on whether it becomes one of the great cult classics of Italy. Hold 10–20 years.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"From perhaps the best known of Mercurey's premier crus, this is a firm solid wine, dense with tannins and concentrated berry fruits. It has a ripe character that is still embedded in the tannins. That means aging and this wine should not be drunk before 2023.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"A blend of Viognier and Arinto, this wine is given another dimension from wood aging. A smoky character adds complexity to ripe apricot and crisp quince flavors. This is juicy and rich while having a refreshing aftertaste.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese White
"This beautiful single-vineyard wine takes all the themes of the regular Wente Cabernet and carries them into deeper, lusher, more complex territory. The color is darker, the depth of flavor more profound, the fruit veering more toward black currants, the tannins more refined, and the fruity-spicy finish simply wonderful and long.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This full-bodied wine opens with earthy aromas of game, leather, ripe black fruit, clove and a balsamic note.

"This bottling, from a vineyard planted in 1972, is still fresh despite being six-years-old, and represents a much lighter style of Cabernet Sauvignon that goes great with a chill. Aromas of strawberry, pepper, bay leaf, leather and black pepper lead into a tart and tangy palate, which shows a light hint of barnyard funk.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"The vintage was a good one for Sequum, which is assembling an impressive track record. The wine is dry and tannic, yet wonderfully forward in blackberries and black currants, and the oak application is perfect. Give it until 2020 or so in the cellar.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

"Raspberries with hints of cranberry dominate this juicy but structured wine. This is a wine that shows a very elegant style, certainly not forceful, but deliciously direct.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"This is a pale-colored wine, very fruity and crisp with an impressively refreshing quality. A touch of pepper gives interest to this dry, easy-drinking wine.",France-Provence:Rosé
"This is an interesting rosé, with a light burnt-orange hue and an orange theme throughout.

There are other aromas such as cherry cough drops and raspberries, while the palate is fruit forward, with flabby acidity.",US-Virginia:Rosé
"A Pommard clone, single-block bottling, this is the most complete and satisfying of the winery's block series of Pinots. Cinnamon toast frames a full-bodied wine loaded with blackberry fruit.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Dark fruit and inky concentration help balance out the wine's sharp acidity. In between its aromatic extremities are layers of dark fruit, cherry cola, white pepper, tobacco and leather. It also shows a menthol finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Dense, heavy aromas of roasted berry fruits and hickory are challenging. This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot shows rubbery tannins and flavors of bacon, clove and hickory that are clearly oak-based. A salty, shearing finish ends with a recurrence of a clove flavor.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Red Blend
"Consistently among the best $20-and-under wines each vintage, this blend of 52% Grenache, 44% Syrah and 4% Tempranillo from vintner Dan Lee delivers plump boysenberry, plum, baking spice and rosemary scents on the nose.

It's already tempting but hold for more complexity. Drink 2018–2033.",Italy-Southern Italy:Aglianico
"Hugely ripe, this is a dense and potentially intense wine. Its high alcohol brings out a disturbing pepper character that spoils the purity of the rich fruits and mineral texture.

Drink through 2023.",Chile-Maule Valley:Carignan

However the final wine turns out, it will be magnificent.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Owner-winemaker Rudi Bauer believes in making Pinot Noirs that can age, so it's no surprise that this is darker, firmer and more muscular than most. There's plenty of toast, cedar and coffee-bean-like oak, but it's amply supported by plum and black cherry fruit. The finish is silky enough to make this wine approachable now, but it will likely improve through at least 2025.",New Zealand-Central Otago:Pinot Noir

Drink through 2025.",Chile-Maule Valley:Red Blend

The wood aging over 18 months only shows fleetingly, leaving fruit as the main thrust. It finishes with plenty of fresh acidity. Drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Complex and showing so much of what we love about Ribera del Duero. Baking spices, mature fruit and leather grace the stately bouquet, while the palate sings a pretty tune of berries, plum and brown sugar. There's thrust and potency to the mouthfeel but also a toasty, rich, mocha character. Drinking good now but should hold in there for another five to eight years.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"A successful expression of Sauvignon Blanc, this has good structure, density and staying power. It delivers stone fruit, citrus, pear, exotic fruit flavors, with touches of spice and green herb on the crisp close.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of French oak, vanilla and a whiff of Asian spice lead the nose. The lean palate offers raw cherry, espresso and oak-driven spice alongside zesty acidity and close-grained, fleeting tannins. Drink through 2017.",Italy-Central Italy:Montepulciano
"With a high proportion of Mourvèdre in the blend, the wine is structured and finely perfumed. It has some firm tannins that are well integrated into the red-berries. While the wine is richly textured, it is also bursting with fruit at the end. Drink from 2018.",France-Provence:Provence red blend
"Exotic fruit aromas and concentrated fruit flavors make this full-bodied wine an attention grabber at first sip. They hold the attention through a fine-grained mouthfeel and lingering finish. A focused core of black-currant flavor runs from first whiff to last impression. It needs time, so drink after 2017.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"For a wine from this appellation, this is soft, bringing out ripe fruit rather than structure. It means the wine will develop quickly and with charm as well as richness. The red fruits are already showing well, as is crisp acidity. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"What you need to know about this wine is that it's pretty sweet. Straddles the border of off-dry, with sugary pineapple, tangerine and vanilla flavors.",US-California:Pinot Gris
"In praise in the Loureiro grape, this dry wine has lively acidity while also having a ripe full texture of apples and pink grapefruit. The wine is crisp and intensely fruity. Drink now and until early 2018.",Portugal-Vinho Verde:Loureiro
"Fleshy oily aromas of orange peel and white flowers lead to a chunky, citric palate that's more full and blocky than elegant. Briny orange and tart nectarine flavors finish plump.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño
"Stone fruit-fuzz and sugar apple combine along a freeway of thick texture and voluptuous flavor in this full-bodied white, aged in both new and neutral French barrels. Creamy vanilla adds additional richness and texture as it finishes strong and ripe.",US-California:Chardonnay
"From the Heideboden Vineyard, this rich and fruity effort combines an intense black-plum flavor with solid tannins. It has a dark character that shows the severe side of Zweigelt. Age for 2–3 years. Glass stopper.",Austria-Burgenland:Zweigelt
"This wine is ripe, smooth and rich. It has a generous feel to it, although never far from the more mineral, steely, terroir-driven character that makes good Pouilly-Fuissé. The top of the range from Château de Fuissé, this wine is selected from 30 different parcels giving an harmonious balance between richness and structure. Age the wine and drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"A fresh, warmly herbaceous wine, with a hint of apricot juice and sweet pink grapefruit. Bright acidity finishes a great apéritif wine.",France-Southwest France:Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a first for Tulpen, a single vineyard, pure varietal Tempranillo. There is a forceful aroma of Jamaican herb, along with brambly berry fruit. The wine shows good weight, proportion and balance. Young fruit from young vines.",US-Washington:Tempranillo
"A rich, evocative, sensual aroma greets the first sniff. The mix of purple fruits, hints of baking spices, and tannins dusted with chocolate is irresistible. Sweet toast comes up next, with pretty fruit flavors in proportion, and a taste of brioche to finish. Aging until 2016–2017 should open it up further.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Fans of Barbera will find the hard acids and thick tannins they love in this rustic Italian variety. The flavors are all dry: dried blackberries and cherries, dried leather, cured tobacco leaf, beef jerky, star anise. Yet there's a fruity sweetness that's charming. Great with almost anything starring sausage.",US-California:Barbera
"This clonal study leans into a quite tropical area, blending aromas of honeysuckle and other white flowers with guava fruit. There is good energy on the palate, with a sour apple-cider character midway, dried pears throughout, stony minerality and a bitter aftertaste.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Sourced from one of the finest vineyards in Oregon, this brings ripe, fleshy, full-bodied fruit flavors front and center. It's a mix of red and black berries, with plump plum, blackberry and mocha all in the center ring.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Expensive, yes, but very lovely and dramatic. Creamy and smooth in the mouth, this is perfectly dry, with rich notes of honey, Mandarin oranges and sweet buttered toast, girded with minerals. Shows control and precision.",US-California:Chardonnay

"Nice and aromatic, with cola, tobacco, fallen dried leaves and dark fruits. The palate has some scratch and acidity to it, but the flavors are good and lively, with a focus on dark plum and cherry. A bit more acidic than I like, but still healthy and very nice for varietal Carmenère.",Chile-Peumo:Carmenère
"Well-rounded, this offers aromas of fresh-cut grass and citrus fruit, citrusy flavors, good acidity, a smooth texture and soft finish. Very refreshing, it will be a good match with seafood, goat cheese or grilled chicken.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc

"Dense and extracted, this opens with aromas that recall resin, prune, nutmeg and oak. On the palate, licorice, toast, espresso and tobacco accent black cherry extract. Firm but not overly persistent tannins offer support.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"This Cabernet Sauvignon blend is very young and ready to drink with its sweet fruit and forward, vanilla-laced flavors. It fades quickly, leaving a lingering impression of soda pop (root beer).",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"For a tight, snappy rendition of Rioja, this answers the call. Herbal plum and tomato aromas are earthy and a touch horsey. Tomato, plum and herbal flavors amount to a saucy whole, while this is fresh, herbal and brothy tasting on a crisp finish.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Aromatic for the variety, this wine shows notes of apple and pear. It's lightly spritzy with an almost unctuous feel.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"Here's a young, strong, vigorous wine that needs cellar time. It's absolutely dry, and hits the palate with numbing tannins. But the blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors are intense and concentrated. Earns its high score by the wonderful combination of elegance and potency. Hold until after 2015.",US-California:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"The Lelarge family has been on the northern slopes of the Montagne de Reims since the 18th century. The family's non-vintage Champagne is soft, rounded and creamy. It has fresh citrus and tangy orange zest fruits that are tight, crisp and with a direct line of acidity. It's totally ready to drink.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"This is another of the producer's intellectual exercises in experimental winemaking, made in tiny case-production numbers. It offers so much to think about, from its lemony-crisp and tangy palate to its chalky tannins. Full bodied, it merits attention, veering from herbal to chocolaty in one sip.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 15% Malbec, 12% Cabernet Franc and 9% Petit Verdot seems slightly muddled, with notes of dried herbs, flowers, barrel spices and plum. Flavors are soft and chocolaty, with an elegant styling and grainy tannins.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a beautiful and highly recommended white that is deliciously redolent of honey, stone fruit, pear, bee's wax and wild sage. The nose has good complexity and the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with good length on the finish.",Italy-Southern Italy:Fiano
"This is Les Vins de Vienne's upscale Crozes, and it's very successful in 2009, featuring bold, concentrated blackberry fruit supported by hints of vanilla and toast. It's full bodied and richly textured, with a long, layered finish. Drink now–2020.",France-Rhône Valley:Syrah
"Beef jerky, dried mushrooms, black pepper, pencil lead, black olive and elderberry swirl into a memorable nose on this wine by professorial vintner Wes Hagen. It's incredibly alive on the palate, delivering soy and deeply tart cranberry-cherry juice flavors, and needs until late 2015 to emerge as an even more solid sipper.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"There's a noticeable background herbal element to this intensely concentrated wine. Dense layers of cassis and chocolate are front and center, filling the mouth with velvety richness and finishing long. Despite the power and richness, there's a structure to match, suggesting this will improve through at least 2012 and drink well until 2020.",Australia-South Australia:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Powerful yet still retaining a sense of restrained style, this wine is packed with ripe plum and sweet berry fruit flavors, laced with firm, dusty tannins. Acidity filters through the dense texture to give great freshness.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Butter, hazelnut and marzipan aromas give a lush first impression, and then vibrant lemon and green-apple acidity provides a firm, balancing effect. This bright-gold, full-bodied wine is concentrated, layered and deep, without being too rich or heavy. Subtle nuances of nutmeg and ginger add to its complexity on the finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This blend of 75% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Colorino opens with aromas that recall underbrush, woodland berries and tobacco leaf. The bright palate delivers tart sour cherry punctuated with white pepper and clove alongside supple tannins. It's already very drinkable so enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"That friendly, familiar, cedar and cinnamon aroma that comes from oak barrels jumps out of the glass when sipping this full-bodied and deep-colored wine. It has gripping tannins that dry the mouth but will work well with pork, beef and lamb. And it blends in enough ripe fruit flavor for good balance. Best now through 2018.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"Bright raspberry fruit dominates here, backed with ample acidity. Give it a little breathing time and it fleshes out and lengthens. At this stage the fruit is clean and primary, but the overall structure suggests giving it another couple of years of bottle age for prime time enjoyment.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"An elegantly crafted Chardonnay that marries vanillin oak with crisp, citrusy flavors. It's medium-bodied, with a slightly creamy texture akin to lemon custard yet stays refreshing through the finish. Drink now through 2010.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Chardonnay

"Aged in French oak puncheons, this youthful, citrusy, big and smoky wine seems to flicker in and out—like an old movie—with each sip revealing a different view of the landscape. Herb, cacao, cassis and balsamic flavors intertwine. The lengthy finish is balanced and structured.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Currant fruits, a tight, mineral character and crisp citrus are combined with a richer potential that will round this wine out over the next year. It has weight, a steely edge and youthful structure.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"For the vintage, this is an austere style of wine, emphasising tannins over fruit. The fruit is certainly rich, and the tannins are dusty rather than dry, but it is a wine which is developing more slowly, suggesting it is also a wine for long-term aging.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A really nice wine, refreshing and light, with delicate lemon-grapefruit flavors complexed with creamy lees. The acidity is very crisp and assertive. No discernible oak at all, and with this pretty fruit and structure, it doesn't need any.",US-Oregon:Pinot Gris
"Mild apple and citrus aromas are simple and clean. A light, tangy palate with virtually no weight tastes of pithy citrus fruits and tropical papaya. Light on the finish, this fades away quietly.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Sauvignon Blanc

"Loads of toasty vanilla from new oak sits on top of blackberry aromas in this dense, non-vintage red. The velvety palate lacks depth but leads to a long, cherry-flavored finish. Drink with grilled sausages.",US-New York:Red Blend

"Faint rose petal notes still perfume the peachy fruit. The palate is rich, medium sweet and honeyed, as though peach and citrus were soaked in honey. This is fresh and rich, rounded and poised, tipping the scales just a little bit more on the rich side. The spice on the finish is reminiscent of honeysuckle.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"This special cuvée comes from the vineyards surrounding the Château de la Marquetterie in Reims.

It is a beautifully balanced wine that is ready to drink.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"This is a fine, beautifully controlled wine. Its dark black currant fruits and firm dense texture are restrained, stylish and delicious. At the same time, the fruits offer a smooth, juicy aftertaste. Keep for 6–7 years.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Bulas wines come from vineyards in the heart of the Douro. This tawny, bottled in 2014, is so finely balanced between ripe dried fruits and the flavors of the wood and acidify that come from aging in barrel. It's a sweeter style of tawny, rich with toffee and caramel flavors, just finished by acidity. Drink now.",Portugal-Port:Port
"This is the winery's second release of this 100% Syrah from the esteemed Stagecoach Vineyard. It's enormously rich and opulent in blackberry, black cherry jam, chocolate, anise and pepper flavors. There's plenty of new French oak, but the wine easily shoulders it. It's a delicious sipper.",US-California:Syrah

"Ripe, luscious blackberry and bramble bush notes are seductive on the nose of this rather big, powerful Cabernet Franc. The palate is forward as well, with rich black-fruit flavors accented by sweet spice and vanilla, along with a fresh swathe of green on the finish.",US-New York:Cabernet Franc
"Strong oak-driven aromas of toasted brioche, vanilla cream and sweet spice dominate the nose. The lush, creamy palate is filled with more of the same, but is supported by peach and mushy pear fruit flavors. A decadent choice that's a good match for salmon or rich seafood.",South Africa-Stellenbosch:Chenin Blanc
"This wine is dense and structured, showing it this is still a work in progress. It has richness rather than huge sweetness with a dry core of botrytis. Bitter honey and spice go with the ripe yellow fruit flavors. Drink from 2018.",France-Southwest France:White Blend
"This well-made wine is fermented in both stainless steel and neutral French oak. Aromas of freshly cut grass and honeysuckle dominate on the nose, while flavors of fig and lemon peel come into play on the racy palate.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"There's lots to like in this Syrah. Although it's severely tannic, it has fine blackberry jam, cola and plum flavors, brightened with brisk acidity and enriched with smoky oak. It doesn't seem like an ager, so enjoy now with beef.",US-California:Syrah
"An odd mix of Graham cracker, blueberry jam and floral aromas yield a kitchen cleanser whole. With time things get better, yielding a big, sticky palate of blueberry, blackberry and syrupy flavors. A grapey big boy with a cloying finish. Good but not balanced quite right.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley:Red Blend
"A lightweight wine, with smoky fruits, soft tannins and bright, vibrant juicy black currants. This is not a wine for aging, but will be delicious in a year or two.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This Oregon winery sources fruit for its Proprietary Red from top Washington vineyards on Red Mountain, in Walla Walla and in the Horse Heaven Hills. Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (it could be labeled as such), it packs its rich raspberry, blueberry and black currant fruit into a precisely-defined, balanced and persistent wine with plenty of power.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A whiff of smoke on entry, then it turns tannic and tight, with thin cranberry fruit driving vertically through the midpalate and on into the finish. Good persistence, though as it fades it turns a little sour.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This expression of Fiano comes forward with crisp, clean aromas of freshly cut lemon, orange blossom and almond paste. The mouthfeel is tonic and lean, but the real point here is the wine's freshness.",Italy-Southern Italy:Fiano
"Perhaps this rating will seem conservative in time, but for now this wine shows a bit too much oak-derived toast and vanilla, giving it an air of superficial attractiveness. Cracked pepper, cassis and mixed berries mingle easily on the palate, but seem to fade on the finish. Drink now, or hold another 4–5 years and see what direction things go.",France-Rhône Valley:Syrah
"Warm blackberry aromas mesh with savory cooked meats, clove, allspice and campfire smoke on this bottling, which features lines from famous sonnets on the back label. The palate shows plum-pie flavors, with allspice, cinnamon and clove.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Acidity marks this mouth watering wine. It's crisp and tart, providing balance to the slightly sweet flavors of pineapple and apricot jam. Good price for a Sauvignon Blanc of this popular style.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Smooth and creamy in texture, this rounded wine is cut easily by acidity, with a tangy background that gives a more mineral edge. With its fresh aftertaste, this is ready to drink. In the Thienpont family since 1946, Nicolas has been the winemaker and a key mover in this appellation since 1983.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Underbrush, red berry and clove aromas carry over to the linear palate, which is steeped in espresso flavor. While it's already accessible, fine-grained tannins give it a firm structure. Drink through 2020.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"A polished, pretty Syrah. It's black in color and very soft, and tastes like a blackberry- and blueberry-infused chocolate drink, with hints of bacon. Luscious and ready to drink now.",US-California:Syrah
Ripe pear is bathed in honey on the nose and palate of this wine. There is a touch of pleasant bitterness reminiscent of fir honey. All this is countered by lemon zest freshness that brightens and lightens and brings beautiful balance and poise. The finish is moreish and refreshing. Drink 2017–2030.,France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"Named for the clone so beloved by winemakers, this white is sourced from two estate vineyards. It opens in confectionary aromas that lead into a full-bodied style that's lushly voluptuous and exotic, yet completely in balance, a celebration of lemon curd, nutmeg and tarte Tatin.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Shy, timid notes of white peach and tropical fruit are offset by hints of vanilla and nutty biscuit. It feels medium to full bodied, but this lacks intensity and concentration overall. A touch of spice on the midpalate adds interest.",US-Virginia:Chardonnay
"Made of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Canaiolo, this opens with violet and leather aromas. The savory, straightforward palate offers mature black cherry, sage and anise flavors, supported by lithe tannins. Enjoy through 2020.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Fresh-pressed blackberry, cedar, dark-chocolate shavings, charcoal and espresso grounds show on this slightly wound up, extremely dark wine. Coffee flavors come through strongly on the thick and sticky palate, where powerful acidity unleashes blueberries and dried herbs. It's a mouthful for certain.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"This wine was aged for a few months in barrel, and that woody character is evident on the nose, which shows butterscotch and dusty spice aromas, as well as the palate, which is lightly oily in feel, with baked, spicy flavors of toasted apple and pear.

"Minty and green, with pronounced gooseberry and feline scent aromas and flavors. This bone-dry, acidic wine needs rich food for balance, like goat cheese.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc

"Puts forth a rich nose with liqueur, vanilla, melon and honey notes. A full mouthfeel is accompanied by apple, spice and smoky elements on the palate.

"Hunnicutt is known as a Cabernet specialist, but they know Chardonnay too, as evidenced by a string of successes since 2008. The 2012 is a rich, rewarding wine.

The grapes were sourced from cool Coombsville and warm Rutherford, giving the wine exceptional balance.",US-California:Chardonnay
"You'll enjoy the heft and added creaminess of this fresh Prosecco Superiore. Peach blossom, white rose and almond skin emerge from the bouquet and make for an informal and friendly personality.",Italy-Veneto:Glera
"The straightforward Cabernet fruit is immersed in new oak, so the dominant flavors of smoke, toast, chocolate and espresso all seem to emanate from the barrel aging. Otherwise it is a simple and perfectly pleasant, no-frills red.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a structured wine with its tight acidity and concentrated white and citrus fruits.

A generous mix of plum, berry and chocolate flavors ends with spice notes and a creamy feel. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo

"Gravenstein apple, honeysuckle and jasmine aromas show on the relatively boisterous nose of this bottling from a large vineyard on Highway 46 east of Paso Robles. There is compellingly grippy texture to the sip, with ripe flavors of pear and honeydew melon. A salty acidity takes it to the next level.",US-California:Albariño

Drink 2017–2022.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"With its excellent concentration of pure fruit power, this is like taking your mouth through a 100 yard dash of raspberry, blueberry and black cherry fruit, right down the heart of the throat. Along the way you find a tight wrapping of rock and espresso, but it's the snappy, sappy fruit that really shines here. Great length.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Brambly red-fruit aromas mix with notes of sweet milk chocolate and dust. It feels crisp, tight and fresh, with raspberry and lightly herbal plum flavors. This finishes taut and fruity. A blend of 75% Garnacha and 25% Tempranillo.",Spain-Northern Spain:Red Blend
Rex Hill makes a wide assortment of Pinots; this sports the black label and is widely available and fruit forward. It's loaded with raspberry and cherry flavors and dusted with a bit of clean earth.

"Vibrant lavender, as well as the flowering tips of rosemary and thyme, meet with blueberry on the floral nose of this wine that shows little of the tarry harshness that often comes from the grape. Lavender also marks the sip, as does white pepper, crushed thyme, dried mint, sage and even tarragon, atop a dark purple-fruit backbone.",US-California:Syrah
"Ripe and dark aromas of black raspberries, blackberries and gingerbread greet the nose on this wine by veteran vintner Larry Brooks. The palate offers up lots of purple flowers with more black raspberry juice, proving tense with energy. Bright acidity cuts through the luscious elements.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Wild berries, from elderberry to salmonberry to mountain strawberries, are in play in this wine. The underpinning scents suggest earth and wet cement, while in the finish a strong flavor of breakfast tea lingers. This is an interesting addition to the Sineann lineup.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"A fabulous blend of Zinfandel, Sangiovese and Syrah, this wine has earthy, dried herb aromas, dense fruit and dark chocolate flavors and considerable soothing tannins. It is dry in style, not too full-bodied, and has a lingering finish. Needs time to mature, and will best after 2018.",US-California:Red Blend
"The savoriness of yeast still lingers on the nose of this wine. The palate brings herbal and sage-like notes to the fore, highlighting its concentrated, rich flavor. Citrus overtones herald the finish, while the saltiness demands you take another sip.",Austria-Kremstal:Grüner Veltliner
"This small producer, based in the Marne Valley, has a strong predilection for Pinot Meunier, which forms 70% of this blend. It gives a soft, ripe character to the wine while allowing plenty of space for crisp apples, lemon and minerality. This bottling is young and should mature for a few more months before drinking in 2017.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Enticing scents of rose, fragrant blue flower, perfumed berry and chopped herb take center stage.

"Named after neighboring winery owner Mike Etzel (Beaux Frères), this exceptional wine is brilliantly focused and rippling with muscular depth.

It's instantly gratifying, impossibly seductive and exceptional in every way.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Big, juicy and smoky, this powerful wine comes from vines in the center of the vineyard. Black fruits and firm tannins dominate the richness of the wine with its dark structure and concentration. A touch of chocolate and licorice partners with the generous fruits. Drink from 2024.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Here's a fun, informal sparkler that has aromas of citrus, orchard fruit and toast. The racy palate shows golden apple, pear, bitter almond and a lemon drop note.",Italy-Southern Italy:Greco

"This opens with aromas that suggest orchard fruit and citrus. The zesty, straightforward palate offers white peach, nectarine and green apple alongside bright acidity.",Italy-Central Italy:Verdicchio
"This wine has so many of the structural elements of a Saint-Estèphe, but also is enveloped by ripe fruitiness.

Drink from 2022.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"The leathery red-berry aromas are a tad stretched and tight but still good. This feels zesty, snappy and alert in the mouth, with lightly herbal flavors of red plum and tangy cherry tomato. The hickory spice imparted from 24 months of oak aging shows up on the finish along with licorice.",Spain-Northern Spain:Red Blend
"Soft and muddled in smoky oak and generous tannin, this wine mixes red currant, raspberry and dried herb, easygoing and robust on the finish.",US-California:Cabernet Franc
"There is almost a touch of burnt sugar on the nose before the more customary aromas of juicy honeyed pear kick in. There are fresher glints, too, of zesty lime and green pear. The palate boosts the juicy pear notes which fill mouth and nose and which are edged with pleasantly bitter pithiness. A touch of residual sweetness amplifies the fruit on the generous palate, but this is balanced with lemony freshness before an off-dry finish. Lovely now but sure to develop. Drink 2017–2030.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"Yeasty wine, with strawberry acidity and an edge of bitterness. The wine is light, frothy in the mouth, the fruit tight with a red currant finish.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend

"This is a creamy ripe wine, spicy and toasty in character with rich Chardonnay and local grapes to give a balanced texture. Acidity is there along with pineapple and white peach flavors. The rich rounded texture is generous and opulent. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2017.",Portugal-Lisboa:Portuguese White

"This bright, informal white has light wildflower and tropical fruit scents. The uber simple, diluted palate offers citrus and peach flavors, alongside zesty acidity.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Grillo

"Rich and fruity, this wine is a full-bodied rosé. It has ripe red fruits and a touch of tannin along with balanced acidity. With its up-front richness, it is a food wine, rather than an apéritif.",France-Provence:Rosé
"This tannic blend is 40% Grenache, 40% Syrah and 20% Petite Sirah. It opens with black cherry and cassis fruit, with a strong flavor of charred wood. Flavors are front-loaded, as the wine quickly turns thin and vinegary.",US-Oregon:Red Blend
"Lifted cherry and floral aromatics carry with them a hint of barrel char in this medium-bodied, elegantly styled blend of 51% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Petit Verdot, 11% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec. It's admirably supple and harmonious from start to finish. Drink now–2015.",New Zealand-Hawke's Bay:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A problematic wine, with unripe, green flavors. The citrus fruits are marred by the herbal taste of boiled vegetables.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"This rich, exuberant, deep-colored red offers the full range of Syrah flavors, from smoke and black pepper to blackberry jam, dried herbs and roast beef. It has an assertive toasty oak overlay and very firm tannins, yet it delivers complexity, full body and real personality.",US-California:Syrah
"In terms of value, Sassoalloro is one of the most interesting wines in Italy. Here you have a major, cult-level super Tuscan available at a surprisingly reasonable price. Elegance and complexity come through in spades and so do fine aromas of red cherry, licorice and toasted almond.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Bold smoky aromas join equally bold and concentrated fruit flavors in this full-bodied well-oaked wine. Beyond the wood smoke and grilled meat components are ample blackberry, dark chocolate and black-cherry flavors.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
Madonna del Piano Riserva's rich elements of barbecue smoke and spice add background nuances to black fruit and mature cherry. But what really sets this Brunello apart is the smoothness of its silky texture.,Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"Made in a big style, this keeps its balance from the aroma through the finish. It has a dark color for what can often be a lighter-colored wine. Aromas recall dark cherries and black pepper, while flavors resemble blackberries. The tannins are firm but the texture is satisfyingly broad and generous.",US-California:Grenache
"This lush, smooth and supple Cabernet is drinkable now for its rich array of red berry fruit, briary spice, red licorice, blond tobacco and sandalwood flavors. It shows the softness of Alexander Valley Cabernet, but make no mistake, the balance enables it to age 6–8 years.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a dense and heady blend, made from 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 17% Petite Sirah. Black-currant leaf, black plum and boysenberry notes lead the nose and mouth, with a light dusting of cocoa, baking spice and sweet oak adding depth to the palate. Medium weight, with a texture like crushed velvet and a bold, flavorful finish. Drink now–2018.",Israel-Galilee:Red Blend

"Spicy, briary cassis and wild berry aromas come with notes of mountain herbs. As per usual, Casa Real 2013 is in great shape; the palate is lush and cushioned but stern and balanced. Spicy cassis, plum and oaky flavors finish with a mix of wood spice and dried-fruit notes. Drink through 2026.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Krug prefers to call this wine multivintage rather than nonvintage, but that doesn’t change what it is. Deep yeast, butter and cider aromas lead into full caramel and apple flavors on the weighty palate; it turns a bit sweet-tart on the finish. Perhaps made with juice from some weaker vintages of the early 1990s, it’s nonetheless very good.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Lychee, roses and sweet white peaches abound in this classic Gewürztraminer. While ebulliently perfumed and slightly brawny in footprint, its bold strokes are balanced with fresh grapefruit acidity. Delicate murmurs of rose potpourri and tea leaves fringe the finish.",US-New York:Gewürztraminer
"A wine glass can hardly contain this lightly colored wine's generous aromas of black olive, sea salt, crushed flowers, orange peel, black pepper, mineral and smoked meat. The smoke and savory flavors display a fascinating mixture of lightness and intensity, leading to a floral finish that seems near endless.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Partial whole-cluster fermentation gives this wine an earthy, tannic closedness, making it unsuitable for drinking now. But it's extraordinarily rich in cherry and currant fruit, with such a long sweet finish that it has got to be an ager. Try after 2009.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Light in appearance with ruby highlights, this Roero delivers easy aromas of tar, cassis, rose and licorice. The wine is light, fresh and sharp with a lean, watery finish.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"This Cava is so heavily oaked that it smells savory and saucy, with almost no fruit to speak of. Woody flavors are barrel-dominated, and so is the monotonous finish.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"On the restrained side, with flinty aromas giving way to notes of grapefruit, melon and fig on the palate. Finishes with a touch of leafiness.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"Pretty generic-tasting but basically good, a dry red wine with considerable tannins and acids that frame herbal cherry flavors.",US-California:Merlot
"Full-bodied and a little forwardly sweet, this deeply colored blush bubbly has flavors of raspberries and cherries, accented with smoky yeast, vanilla cookie and peppery spice. Drink now through 2010.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"Taking an oxidized approach to the grape, this golden wine shows aromas of crushed almonds, hazelnut brittle, dried apricot mash and a bit of iodine. The palate is reminiscent of lemon preserves—salty, tart, rich and exotic—with a marzipan touch on the finish.",US-California:Chenin Blanc
"Barrel aromas are out front, with notes of char, toast and vanilla along with dark raspberry and spice. The palate presents a mixture of fruit and barrel, with the latter showing a bit too prominently.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Red berry, rose and a sprinkling of baking spice aromas unfold in the glass while the firm, youthful palate offers tart red cherry, strawberry, star anise and white pepper. It's young but balanced, with bright acidity and assertive but refined tannins that leave a firm finish. Drink 2019–2024.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"There is very little Carmenère in Washington, and Beresan's limited and sought-after varietal offering is restricted to tasting room and mailing list customers only. Balanced and tight, the crisp red fruits are annotated with hints of gun metal, toast and cinnamon. Just a touch of pepper and leaf, along with streaks of licorice and vanilla in the finish.",US-Washington:Carmenère
"Floral, young and jumpy smelling, with gumball aromas that leave you with the impression that the wine's clarity, balance and purity may be tenuous. The palate is raw but fresh, with simple but snappy wild berry flavors. Not a lot of structure or depth here.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"A pear-flavored wine, still fresh and young, showing its mineral texture, which is likely to soften. It's delicate, the lightest of the range of Rieslings from Rupert Summerer, the white fruits offering some sweetness as a balance to the bone-dry structure. Glass stopper.",Austria-Kamptal:Riesling
"Very fresh pear, melon and tropical fruit, medium body and a clean, crisp, citrusy finish make this a wine to rely on with a wide range of foods. It should pair well with just about anything that normally works with white wine.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Chardonnay
"Smells like a field of wild flowers and weeds on a hot summer's day. There's sweaty leather and rhubarb along with murky, mildly soupy berry flavors. Lacks proper balance and freshness, and instead shows a weedy, sticky side.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Herbal black-fruit aromas come with a lot of oak. This is full, chunky and meaty in feel, with green hints and blackberry flavors appearing before a blast of hickory smoke takes over. A high-toast, slightly bitter finish confirms the strong oaky character.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon
A round and spicy Merlot. Dark plum and blackberry flourish while fleeting nuances of tobacco glimmer on the medium-length finish. The silky texture and soft tannins are sure to please those with a gentler palate.,Israel-Galilee:Merlot
"From a certified organic, dry-farmed vineyard, this wine exudes an overabundance of rustic earth without finding a rightful companion in fruit, with just the merest hint of allspice underplayed on the finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Pure, estate-grown Cabernet Franc, this is focused and spicy, with hard-packed black fruits in abundance. Initially showing lush aromatics with plenty of baking spices, it's also threaded with graphite, black coffee and a whiff of smoke off the grill. This needs decanting or better yet, some further cellar time; try after 2017.",US-Oregon:Cabernet Franc
"This blend of Sangiovese, Merlot, Cabernet and Syrah is a tad too ripe and jammy. Chocolate fudge and ripe blueberry are backed by strawberry preserves, cinnamon, exotic spice and ground clove. The tannins are chewy.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"One of the biggest wines you'll find from Spain. It starts with brawny, malty aromas of ultraripe berries, leather and earthy warmth. The palate is searing, with baked pie flavors, chocolate and heat. Finishes with even more licorice and mint, and at 16% this is one chewy red wine. Not for fans of elegant, lighter-framed reds. Only 600 cases made.",Spain-Northern Spain:Garnacha
"Ripe black-skinned fruit, bell pepper, dried herb, French oak and balsamic aromas lead the nose on this 100% Merlot. The ripe concentrated palate offers dried blackberry, raw cranberry, espresso, vanilla and a confectionery note alongside firm, grainy tannins that leave an astringent mouth-drying finish. Give the tannins another year or two to soften, then drink up to enjoy the remaining freshness and fruit.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Weighty and creamy in rich tones of just-picked pineapple and Key lime, this is round and expansive on the palate, with undertones of earth and herb. Complex layers of apple and almond interplay, before a finish of honey and spice lingers.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Aromas suggest underbrush, coffee and a hint of meat juices. The palate delivers dense black raspberry accented with grilled herbs, vanilla and light toasted notes alongside the heat of evident alcohol. It's monolithic and ready so drink soon.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"The nose is not very suggestive, however, the palate comes alive and paints a vivid picture of both refreshing and mellow notes of red and black cherry. The body shows a lovely, fine-grained texture that brushes softly against the tongue to send more ripples of cinnamon-spiced cherries your way. Fresh, lively and beautifully aromatic with a mellow finish tinged with peony and rose.",Austria-Thermenregion:St. Laurent
"Rose petal, perfumed berry, new leather, pressed powder and underbrush are just some of the enticing scents you'll find on this stunning wine. The structured palate is loaded with finesse, offering crushed cherry, black raspberry and licorice accompanied by polished tannins. This is the firm's last vintage of Santo Stefano, and they nailed it. Drink 2017–2026.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Not in the same league as Donelan's Syrahs. The Grenache seems to drag it down. It's paler in color, there's a vegetal smell, and it's simple in berry, cola and spice flavors. Drink now.",US-California:Grenache-Syrah
"Searing acidity marks this wine, which tastes like it has a lot of Edna Valley fruit in the blend. It also shows bright, strong, long hangtime flavors of limes and pineapples. It's actually quite a fine Chardonnay, dry and low in alcohol. A great value at this price.",US-California:Chardonnay
This is a strangely chemical wine that has overripe fruit. It misses out on initial acidity and fruitiness.,France-Provence:Red Blend
"Tastes more like a Zinfandel, with peppery flavors of wild blackberries and briary mulberries, edged with tobacco and balsam. Tannic, too, with a rough mouthfeel. Doesn't seem like an ager.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Floral red-fruit aromas show a touch of wild animal. The tight and choppy palate holds racy flavors of cherry and plum. A long, fruity finish rolls out little by little, with a lasting feel of grape skins.",Spain-Catalonia:Red Blend
"Crisp and tight, this is a steely, mineral-driven wine. The texture is taut and nervy, lively with acidity and just hinting at a more creamy future. The toasty edge is attractive and fills the wine. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Round and soft, this has fresh, attractive fruit, flavors of white pears, candy and green herbs. Just a touch of sweetness in the acidity of the aftertaste.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Minty cherry aromas and a distant mineral note akin to crushed seashells set up an honest, slightly rubbery palate with medicinal cherry flavors that come with a touch of bitterness. A juicy, steady finish is fresh but straightforward.",Spain-Levante:Tempranillo
"This is a big wine, broad and fruity. Keeping the firm tannins and minerality well behind the red berry fruit flavors, it already shows drinkability. This second wine from Poeira is also a wine that could age impressively, full and structured. Drink now and until 2020.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"This wine begins with a clean and cool nose featuring green banana and other subdued tropical notes as well as salty seaspray. Once sipped, the tropical side emerges more, with papaya and guava, as well as overripe peach. Altogether, the alcohol feels a bit high.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Ripe and fleshy, this wine is firm and dry, but has extra-ripe fruit. Perhaps the fruit is too rich, leaving the wine unbalanced. In the future, it will show fewer tannins and more fruit. Corinne and Charles-Henri Gonet of the Gonet Champagne family bought Bacalan with the intent of restructuring the vineyards, some of which had not been planted for 70 years. The first red vintage was 2001; first white vintage was 2014.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This offers aromas of mature plum, berry, toasted oak and coffee. The straightforward palate offers roasted coffee beans, espresso, dried black cherry and licorice alongside fine-grained tannins. The fruit is starting to dry up, so drink soon.",Italy-Piedmont:Barbera
"Vibrant and elegant, this offers aromas of wild flower and ripe red berry. The juicy palate doles out tart red cherry, fresh strawberry and mineral alongside tangy acidity. A mouthwatering saline note closes the bright finish.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nerello Mascalese
Green apple and honeysuckle aromas follow through to the fresh polished palate along with nectarine drop and white peach. Bright acidity lifts the rich flavors while a creamy mousse lends finesse.,Italy-Veneto:Glera
"A note of flinty reduction still hovers above the nose, signalling a wine still needing bottle age. Underneath, juicy peaches are enlivened with notes of fresh, tart passion fruit. The final picture is one of balanced poise and lasting, juicy aroma. Drink 2017–2025.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"This is the most extravagant version of three wines in a range in which grower Didier Pelvillain uses the figure seven for its mystic qualities. Here, the wine is ripe, brimming with fresh black fruits and acidity. The structure is firm in the background, allowing the wine to age. Drink from 2019.",France-Southwest France:Malbec
"Three-fifths was whole-cluster fermented, and the wine spent 18 months in 20% new French oak. This bottling amplifies the house style, which favors ripe, concentrated flavors of strawberry and raspberry fruit, adding highlights of chocolate and espresso. A whiff of dried straw wraps this up.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Lots of rich raspberry, cherry and cola flavors in this Pinot Noir. It has a delicate, silky texture and some true complexity, but is a little too soft to age. Drink up.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Focused aromas of blackberry, elderberry and black currant show on the nose of this blend of 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Syrah and 4% Cabernet Franc, which also offers hints of leather, nettle and caramel on the nose.

"This blend of 63% Zinfandel and 37% Cabernet Sauvignon showcases upfront fruitiness, with supportive structure. Smoky oak cradles its extroverted ripeness, with a concentration that's sure to win over fans of the style.",US-California:Red Blend
"This bottling by fine producer Kunde always shows a grassy, hay-like note to the citrus fruit flavors, so if that's your style, you'll like it. The wine itself is only lightly oaked, and feels crisp and clean in the mouth, as well as dry. The low alcohol is a pleasure.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"A bright purple tint announces a jumpy youthful-smelling wine with plum, black currant and oak aromas. This is Carignan, Syrah, Garnacha and Cab Sauvignon, and it's full in body but also juicy and lively. Savory, saucy plum and berry flavors ride a wave of crisp acidity, while the finish feels dry and exact, with minty medicinal overtones. Drink this snappy wine through 2021.",Spain-Catalonia:Red Blend
"Rather thin on the palate, the wine feels slightly unfocussed. Drink soon.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"Dusty minerals, smoke and pollen notes lend an earthy tone to ripe pineapple, tangerine and lemon flavors in this dry Riesling. It's a bit rustic in style, but fresh citrus acidity and a bristling of lime pith brightens the finish. Drink now through 2019.",US-New York:Riesling

"Restrained lemon and apple aromas are accented by bramble on this crisp, light-bodied Riesling. It's delicate in concentration but its bracing lemon-lime acidity refreshes. Drink now through 2018.",US-New York:Riesling
"Can you guess what the S stands for? The nose is tarry and intense, full of black olives, plum and espresso. Yup, it's Syrah. Full-bodied and velvety, but with a firm core and a rich, layered finish. It's fine now, but try to hold some until 2016 and possibly as late as 2020.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Bright red berry and violet aromas lead off this soft, medium-bodied red. The palate offers dark cherry and a whiff of white pepper alongside round tannins. It's already accessible so enjoy soon. Drink through 2017.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"With its ripe red fruits and crisp acidity, this has a brightness that exudes charm and freshness. The aftertaste brings out a more textured character from a tangy orange zest flavor.",France-Provence:Rosé

"A savory rather than fruity blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache, this bottling offers black pepper, anise and light violet alongside boysenberry and elderberry fruit on the nose. The palate tightens up into underripe cherry, thyme, marjoram and bay leaf, with very dry elderberry fruit tones.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Made entirely from Sangiovese, this starts with aromas of underbrush, iris, red berries, mint and toasted notes. The wine then discloses a core of black cherry accented with menthol, white pepper, cinnamon-spice and hints of espresso. This is already approachable so enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Fruit from this high-profile vineyard builds a velvety silky seductive wine that impresses immediately. It captures the ephemeral elegance of the grape, in a young wine with well-managed phenolics. The strawberry-centric fruit is lightly dusted with cinnamon, from 15 months in 50% new French oak.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Smoky leather and cedar notes rest on a brawny foundation of bold, dry tannin and generous black fruit in this dusty wine. Full-bodied and dense, it opens to show additional tobacco and chocolate aspects.",US-California:Zinfandel
"A superb value, this estate-grown Pinot brings dense fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry, sourced from Dijon clones. Firm and slightly high-toned, it spent 17 months in one-third new oak, resulting in baking-spice notes that unfold on the finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Floral red fruit aromas carry a hint of minerality and garrigue. The palate is lively, with good overall balance. Tastes of ripe red plum, raspberry and vanilla, while the finish is light in weight and quick, but satisfying.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"At first the aromas of hard cheese and blatant oak veil the black fruit quotient in this blend. However, in the mouth the wine is more expressive and ripe, with plum, berry and ample oak-driven vanilla. It doesn't appear to have much depth or complexity, but overall it is smooth and pleasant.",Spain-Northern Spain:Red Blend
"In the prestigious village of Vosne-Romanée, there is little room for anything but Grand and Premier Cru vineyards. This wine, from the flatter ground at the bottom of the slope, shows something of the structure that makes the great wines. To balance that it also has bright fruit and plenty of acidity. It will be ready to drink from early 2018.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Vall Llach is known for making ripe-styled wines, and this fits the bill. Embruix is ripe and raisiny on the nose, with black currant and prune-like aromas. A thick, jammy, stewy palate holds flavors of prune, blackberry and bitter chocolate, while the finish is hot and sticky, with molasses and chocolate flavors.",Spain-Catalonia:Red Blend
"The best of a very fine flight of 2010 Pinots from Rex Hill, the La Colina offers a succulent mix of crushed flower, berry and liquid rock. The flavors meld beautifully, with vivid, lively acidity that brings a touch of grapefruit. The label reads Willamette Valley, though the vineyard is in the Dundee Hills AVA.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"This wine provides immediate appeal with its aromas of citrus peel, starfruit, mineral and apricot, with tropical notes lurking in the background. It's fleshy in feel with a tart zing of acid that stitches it all together.",US-Washington:Grenache Blanc
"Sweet plum and pie cherry fruit highlights a bright and spicy style. The young vines push all the flavor up front, then hold on for dear life as the midpalate lingers on a note of lightly chocolaty plum. The tannins need some softening; there is a stemmy flavor that slightly mars the finish.",US-Washington:Grenache
"An impressively structured wine, full of concentrated fruit and tannins. It shows ripe plums, layered with chocolate, spice and a hint of pepper, finished with wood. It needs aging 3–4 years.",France-Loire Valley:Cabernet Franc
"Rooty aromas of licorice and sarsparilla are out front, followed by a big wave of barrel char. This wine feels good but a little abrupt and choppy. Savory flavors of barbecue and meaty berry fruits finish blackened and peppery, with a lasting note of charred wood.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo Blend
"Sappy, tannic and loaded with plum and blueberry, some cassis and chocolate. A good follow-up to the previous vintage, with very dark fruit, polished tannins and a lengthy, tasty finish of chocolate-covered cherries.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Made by Long Shadows winemaker Gilles Nicault, this wine, along with the 2008 and 2009 vintages, were released together. This is the most mature—a five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend. It's a beautifully integrated, floral and dusty wine, with contoured, sculpted fruit. Plums and cherries dominate, with dustings of cocoa powder, coffee and a hint of hazelnut. The wine is graceful and profound, with superb length and finesse.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"With its tough tannins, this solid wine also shows dark fruits and black plum skins, finishing with fresher acidity.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is an easygoing Chardonnay-based sparkling wine (made in the classic method in which secondary fermentation occurs in the bottle) with pristine aromas of mature fruit and a touch of freshly baked bread. The quality of the effervescence is steady, creamy and tonic.",Italy-Lombardy:Chardonnay
"Despite some almost citrusy and asparagus-like aromas, this well-built Cabernet compensates by offering a creamy, supple texture and moderately rich coffee flavors. Finishes a bit astringent and hard, but should soften in a year or two.",Australia-South Australia:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Plump apricot, melon and white peach abound are luscious. Yet it's dry in style and bracing too, edged by taut acidity and a steely, mineral edge. Accessible and elegantly balanced, its a four-square wine with excellent value.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"This light wine has vanilla flavors from wood aging, fresh red fruits and soft tannins. Acidity gives wine poise and an elegant touch. Drink from 2015.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"Substantive in oak and weight, this concentrated, estate-grown wine is impressive in velvety texture and a savory conjuring of tobacco and black tea. Dark, brambly blackberry and dark cherry join in on the fun, providing vibrancy amid all the sophistication. Finishing with a dash of cardamom, this wine will cellar nicely through 2020.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"White-fruit aromas are without frills. Like the nose, this wine feels fresh and clean. Flavors of white peach and slightly underripe honeydew are mild and don't force anything on a pleasant finish.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend
"This is a fragrant, floral wine, with a smooth touch of vanilla. It has a fruity, ripe feel, and it shows fresh, crisp, apple-like acidity. This is a ready-to-drink, balanced Chardonnay.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Just-ripe green pears and scented spring flowers make this a charming proposition. Underneath, a firm and concentrated body unfolds into a refreshing and long finish.",Austria-Kamptal:Grüner Veltliner
"This wine impresses from first pop, a complicated, well-crafted exploration of full-bodied flavor and brambly beauty. Blueberry pie, violet and cigar tease the nose as they follow through on a soft, supple layering of fine-tuned texture. But it's the stony minerality and undeniable coaxing of white pepper that imprint the memory. This wine should only get better through 2034.",US-California:Petite Sirah
"Although this includes only 3% Viognier, it's apparent from the musky hints of gingery spice on the nose. Ginger, nasturtium and melon flavors round out an expansive mouthfeel. It's odd—especially in a lineup of more traditional Sem-Sauvs—but not unpleasant. Drink now.",Australia-Western Australia:Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon
"In the Brigue range, this is the entry-level wine. With its attractive fruits and lively acidity, the wine is easy and crisp. It has a clean pure red-fruit flavor that makes it refreshing and ready to drink.",France-Provence:Rosé
"A big, dry, immature wine, firm in acids and tannins, whose strong black pepper notes add to its tart pungency. Underneath all that are immaculate blackberry and roasted meat flavors. Impressive for the price, and should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",US-California:Syrah
"This wine veers slightly sweet, like many overripe red blends. It's deep in color, soft in and makes a good counterpoint to spicy foods.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"From the Erice area of Sicily in the southwest corner of the island, this bright Insolia offers crisp aromas of citrus, cut grass and white almond. It's a simple, genuine wine that is put together nicely.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Insolia
"From a field blend interplanted with Viognier, which accounts for 2% of the wine, this dense, thick expression of this burly variety exudes velvety blueberry and blackberry around almost impenetrable tannins, the leathery roughness still being sorted out. Cellar through 2020 to coax out its finer flavors of mocha and meat.",US-California:Syrah
"Vibrant and straightforward, this opens with delicate aromas of Spanish broom, citrus fruit and herb. The bright, simple palate offers tangerine and a bitter almond note alongside zesty acidity.",Italy-Central Italy:Verdicchio
"A straight-ahead Riesling, pleasant but uncomplicated. Minerals envelop white stone fruit on the palate; the fruit is more fruit skin than flesh. Nose is light and feminine, with citrus and confectioners' sugar notes.",Australia-Western Australia:Riesling
"Aromas of white pepper and pear start it off, and it smells snappy and inviting. The palate is all about grapefruit and orange; in a word, it's citrusy. The finish comes in waves, with notes of stone fruit and licorice. As a whole it's round and satisfying, but it's also a tad bit dilute and dull, which is why it rates where it does.",US-Oregon:Pinot Gris
"This Tuscan blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio opens with crisp, almost tart, tones of citrus, exotic fruit and honeydew. The wine shows substance in the mouth and enough heft to pair with tuna or chicken salad.",Italy-Tuscany:White Blend
"Swathes of ripe fruit dominate this full wine that verges on being too alcoholic. While the acidity gives it freshness and the perfumed Cabernet Franc in the blend lends lift, the wine seems weighed down by its own richness.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A seductive nose, densely loaded with black currants and smoke, leads into a textural, single-vineyard, 100% Cabernet with great varietal presence and definition. It needs to breathe open, which puts on more flesh, and starts to unpack the layers. Streaks of mineral, iron, graphite and more cassis roll into the finish.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made with organic grapes, the nose offers oak, toast and espresso. The bracing palate shows dried cherry notes alongside raspy tannins that grip the finish. It doesn't have the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This old-vines Rueda delivers green-leaning aromas of Granny Smith apple, lime and lettuce. A citric, stony palate is linear and direct, with fine-tuned acidity. Citrusy flavors of lime and green apple turn briny on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain:Verdejo
"A very light Syrah, with pleasant watermelon and raspberry fruit, that hangs in there until the fairly soft tannins take over.",US-Washington:Syrah
This is a fine entry-level rosé from this Provence classed-growth estate. It has fresh red fruits and a light texture that is rounded out with some concentration and almond flavors. Drink now.,France-Provence:Rosé
"This dark concentrated Syrah is loaded with spicy black-fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is hard and tannic as well as fresh, racy and juicy. Spiced plum, cherry and blackened gritty flavors turn peppery on a tannic finish.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Syrah
"The 2011 vintage is a high-water mark for the Indian Wells Chardonnay, principally because the oaky, buttered popcorn flavors have been muted. It's a firm, slightly tart mix of green and yellow fruits, with supporting acids and excellent length. Pleasantly toasty, but not over the top.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"Parent company Schramsberg has a great track record with this JD bottling, and with this 2011, they've produced another fine, ageable wine. It's dry, tannic and complex in blackberry jam, mu shu plum sauce and oak flavors. Beautiful to drink now, it will gain traction through 2020.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This medium-bodied appellation wine is impressive in its combination of crisp red fruit, rhubarb, watermelon and pomegranate flavors alongside a dash of orange citrus. The smooth texture adds to the whole, as does a seasoning of allspice, while the finish is snappy in acidity.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Aromas of blue flower, red berry, baking spice and toasted oak lead the nose. Made entirely with Sangiovese, the bright palate offers red cherry, raspberry and a hint of cinnamon alongside polished tannins.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This blend is 44% Cab Franc, 31% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the rest Merlot. It's stubbornly closed, with aromas of tar, earth and rubber ball rather than fruit. Some brambly berry flavors can be found, but the finish seems hard and slightly bitter.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This off-dry Riesling offers plenty of concentrated apple juice flavors accented by a dash of lemon and savory apple pie spice. There's a hint of petrol throughout that adds a layer of depth, but overall, it's simple and easy drinking.",US-New York:Riesling
"Fully oaked, and you can tell via the aromas of coconut, resin, vanilla and latex that sit on top of tobacco and floral berry scents. Feels tight and high in acid, with herbal-leaning red berry flavors. Fresh and basic on the finish, with lasting acidity.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dusty, earthy plum and cherry aromas are a bit scratchy but enjoyable and powerful. A smooth, plummy palate entertains flavors of toasty black fruits and peppery spice, while the finish is meaty and full, with easy tannins. Drink through 2017.",Spain-Levante:Monastrell
"As a whole, this is top-shelf Malbec with weight, character and complexities. It's also a touch gamy on the nose, with a no-miss blast of compost. Beyond that, the palate shows lemony oak and tight tannins on top of oaky, leathery flavors of robust berry and baked plum. Drink this rock-solid specimen now through 2016.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"This juicy, fruity wine also brings a firm structure to bear. It is rich, friendly and ready to drink soon. Keep for a few months for the tannins to fill out.",Portugal-Península de Setúbal:Portuguese Red
"Tomato and herb aromas are followed by red fruit and peppery notes. The simple finish does nothing to hurt or improve the wine. It's very Average, but drinkable.",Chile-Maule Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas recall leafy forest floor, toasted oak, cured meat and a whiff of farmyard. The ripe, one-dimensional palate shows dried black cherry, vanilla and a confectionary note, with round but not very persistent tannins. Drink soon.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Crystal-clean, agile aromas of peach and melon are ideal. This wine feels elegant and just right, with flavors of sea brine, citrus and tropical fruits working in harmony. Peppy, acid-driven stone-fruit flavors carry a fine finish.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño
"This shows Nebbiolo in its glorious infancy, with tight aromas of currant and wild berry followed by background tones of tar, licorice and softly toasted spice. The tannins are firm and will soften with a few more years of aging.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Talk about a composed wine; this opens with pure, subtle scents of raspberry, cherry and licorice. Next up is a young but clean palate housing choppy, bright acidity. Wild berry, herb and carob flavors finish with breadth and grab; drink this varietal Monastrell through 2020.",Spain-Levante:Monastrell
"Fragrant with orange blossom and tart, tangerine-based fruit. The barely-perceptible residual sugar is listed at 0.53%. Solid winemaking by Lynn Penner-Ash, as usual.",US-Oregon:Riesling
"Rich and soft, this Chard has strong flavors of stewed apricots, peaches, pineapples and vanilla. It would benefit from more crispness.",US-California:Chardonnay
"All varietal and aged in neutral French oak, this wine offers brooding aromas of coffee, cream and violets. The herb and savory flavors are soft and reserved in feel with a lingering finish.",US-Washington:Syrah
"This is a very precise wine, steely and mineral. It has a smoky, flinty character that fits the image of an age-worthy Chablis. Under this texture lies the potential of delicious fruitiness, fresh and packed with sliced apple and quince flavors. Drink this wine from 2018.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This mixes darker shades of berry and cherry fruit, with a streak of tobacco and well-managed tannins. It's polished and carries moderate weight through the finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir

"A totally fresh and herbaceous wine, this is very crisp and citrusy. It does have some weight as well, a ripe character that comes from apple juice and pear flavors. The wine is great to drink now but could age.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Piercing aromas of char and creosote are like a laser pop surrounded by a note of blackberry. This is raw, tannic and hard on the palate. Chunky berry flavors are heavily oaked, while this is jammy in feel and tastes of blueberry on the finish. Drink through 2021.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"From Aegerter's own vineyards, this is an initially soft wine. It's only when the background tannins kick in that it becomes firmer, giving a dry, still-young core to this ripe wine. Red fruits dominate, balanced by acidity and a stylish, while firm, aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Very perfumed aromas of violets and Hawaiian Punch hit the nose. The palate is effervescent and bouncy, with sour pomegranate and fruit skin bitterness.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This wine starts off with notes of blackberry, mint and asphalt on the nose, unfurling on the tongue to reveal tar, black olive, meat and blackberry flavors. It's full bodied and intense, even a bit warm on the finish. Impressively concentrated, but slightly bitter as well.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
"Lots of ripe strawberries, raspberries and sweet smoky oak in this silky young Pinot Noir. It tastes a bit too extracted and jammy for subtlety, but sure does offer a mouthful of flavor.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"This opens with pretty aromas of violets, plum cake and black berries. The juicy, smooth palate delivers crushed black cherry alongside supple tannins and bright acidity.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend

The oak (20% new French) seems far out front here with vanilla overpowering the notes of fig. It drinks dry with a creamy feel and abundant vanilla flavors.,US-Washington:Sémillon
"Yeasty aromas of bread crust and mature white stone fruit lift out of the glass. Rounded and refreshing, the vivacious palate shows ripe yellow apple and Bartlett pear alongside bright acidity and a firm perlage.",Italy-Veneto:Glera

"Sweet and soft, with cherry pie, date and toffee flavors dominating. You could almost drink it as a dessert wine.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"The Escarpment style is always one of ample ripeness, weight and structure, and the 2009 measures up to the winery's previous successes. Plummy fruit is tinged with a dark chocolate note, while the palate is richly textured, and the finish is long and velvety. Drink now–2018.",New Zealand-Martinborough:Pinot Noir
This wine has mild flavors and a full mouthfeel. The aroma is light and vanilla-like while soft pear and nutmeg accents lay low on the palate.,US-California:Chardonnay
"Ripe red-cherry and strawberry aromas are lifted by grated clove and mace spice on the inviting nose of this bottling by longtime Winemaker Eric Hickey.

"There are copious amounts of earth and herbs on the nose of this blend of 28% Merlot, 28% Sangiovese, 22% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Carmenere, 6% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot, showing baked earth, red bell pepper and leather.

"Light and fresh, this is immediately attractive with its green fruits, spice and hints of almonds. There is also a backdrop of minerality to this still-young wine. Aromatic and crisp, it can be drunk now.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Full bodied and fruity, the 2010 estate Syrah from Va Piano is rounder and less herbal than the 2009. Which style you enjoy is a matter of individual preference. Big and approachable, with lovely blueberry fruit, the 2010 seems to stop a bit short, but with more bottle age may reveal details that are currently in hiding.",US-Washington:Syrah

"Yorkville has been making this blend of Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc (for this vintage it's 60% the first and 40% the latter), for many of its 25 years, and it achieves a nice balance, the Sémillon there for richness, texture and color, the SB for acidity and the wine's citrus and herb finish.

"From a well-loved, well-revered vineyard, this full-bodied, generously lush and plush wine was aged in French oak, a good proportion of it new, for 21 months.

"This bottling by Hobbs typically is a compelling Pinot Noir, but with the 2011 vintage, they've exceeded even the outstanding 2010. The wine is extraordinarily delicate in the mouth, with a cloud-like airiness that's like pure silk. Yet there are powerful raspberry, cherry, herb, cassis, mushroom and sandalwood flavors that are a delight to experience. The wine has none of the unripe vegetal notes that mar so many other 2011 Pinot Noirs. Drink this gorgeous wine now and over the next 10 years.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"This unusual blend of Syrah, Grenache, Tempranillo and Mourvèdre is the kind of red wine that needs spicy, salty beef or lamb to balance it. It's tannic, acidic and peppery, with a roasted meat edge to the blackberry fruit. Calls to mind Italian-style fare, rich in olive oil and cheeses.",US-California:Red Blend
"Apple, lime and mineral aromas lend freshness to a mature nose. This feels round and plump, but well balanced due to fine acidity. Peach and citrus flavors are stony and finish with tropical notes of lychee and mango. Drink now.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño

"Very rich and ripe, with luxurious blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate and sweet oak flavors. Feels soft and complex in the mouth, with thick but gentle tannins. It's a little generic, in the modern style, but tasty.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Barolo Riva is a fantastic wine with enormous personality and charm. At the outset, the wine appears modern and bold with determined aromas of black fruit and spice. But wait a second and the wine will surprise you with its sassy complexity and finesse. Give it 10 more years of cellar aging. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Vibrant blackberry and cherry flavors are accented by complexities of rose petal, bramble and savory herb in this elegant, light-footed red. It's not deeply complex or penetrating, but quite charming, marked by sunny cherry acidity and a plush, lingering palate.",US-New York:Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Made from 90% Sangiovese plus other grapes, it opens with subtle aromas of blue flowers, black berries and toasted sensations. The juicy, dense palate offers ripe black cherry and raspberry spiced up with notes of black pepper and clove. Polished and extremely friendly, this is ready to be enjoyed soon.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Berry and plum aromas are a touch oaky, foresty and spicy. This is a tight, drawing Tempranillo with tannic bite but also fruit in reserve. Flavors of raspberry and plum are more generic than elevated, while a toasty, slightly bitter finish with mild heat brings it home.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tinto Fino
"Both the golden color and the advanced nose signal a mature wine. The nose has a lifted quality that references white sultanas, dried pineapple, chalk and cooked champignons, with sumptuous, pleasantly bitter notes of dark fir honey. Contrary to expectation, the palate is merely off dry. It has an intriguing, almost salty quality with inflections of soy-sauce savoriness and immense depth of flavor. Still is sprightly and fresh, the wine has a streak of lemon freshness at its core. Lovely now and mature, it can be enjoyed until at least 2020.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"An easy blend of Pinot Bianco, Tai and Manzoni Bianco, this is a fresh, crisp white wine with aromas of white flower, sambuca and citrus.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:White Blend
"This wood-aged wine is crisp and displays a great balance between acidity and rich fruits. The wine is still young, although you can see the good acidity, mineral texture and refined toastiness. The elements are coming together to give a wine that will age well. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (78%), with the rest equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Aromas of barrel spice, cedar, green herbs and black fruit are followed by tightly coiled fruit and barrel flavors that need some time to settle in.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This blend of 75% Marsanne and 25% Roussanne is extremely floral, fruity and tropical on the nose, with coconut, mango, guava and tuberose scents. Acidity helps keep that ripeness in check on the palate, but the tropical flavor is powerfully persistent.",US-California:Rhône-style White Blend
"The fruit here is certainly more ripe and powerful than in the winery's regular bottlings. But it is offset by rugged tannins, and an earthiness that borders on rusticity. —P.G.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Rounded wine, soft in character, its creamy texture given a boost by apple and lime flavors. An easy wine that is full in the mouth while still seeming light.",France-Alsace:Pinot Blanc

"Oak, espresso and toast aromas take center stage and follow through to the tightly wound palate along with a hint of butterscotch, coconut and the barest hint of dried cherry. It possesses structure but lacks the fruit richness to stand up to the assertive tannins and evident oak.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo

The palate rides the line expertly between ripeness and tartness, with fresh boysenberry flavors and dried oregano, altogether excellently spiced.",US-California:Syrah
"From an small estate that also has vines in Chénas and Saint-Amour, this is a firmly tannic wine that also has attractive juicy red-berry fruits.

"This bold and full-bodied wine has fragrant fruit aromas and oodles of berry flavor, plus a firm texture created by ample fine-grained tannins and supportive acidity. What makes it special is how the grippy texture wraps around the opulent blackberry and boysenberry flavors for great balance and a sense that it will age well through 2022.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This wine has aromas of oak, red currants and roasted coffee bean. Oak dominates the palate, with toasted sensations and espresso taking center stage over the subdued red fruit sensation.

"Matured in large wooden vats, this is a wine that is so ripe and rich. With great fruit allied to an opulent texture, it is both spicy and full of tropical fruit flavors. At the moment, it is just bursting with fruit and will need time to calm down, so wait to drink until 2019.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of starched sheets and lanolin show a hint of apple. This feels rather lean and similar to soda: there isn't much body to it. Tropical melony flavors are oaky, and the finish turns downright woody and sweet like canned pineapple.",Chile-Leyda Valley:Chardonnay

Cherry is the predominant flavor, and on the finish there's vanilla and tannins that won't quit.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese

Drink now–2016.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Very ripe yellow plum, immediately tempered by zesty grapefruit, is the chief notion on the nose. The palate seems softer and even has a smoky note.

Drink as of 2017.",Austria-Wachau:Grüner Veltliner

"Bristling lime acidity and savory tones of herb and smoke contrast ripe tangerine and cantaloupe flavors in this dry single-vineyard Riesling. It's a concentrated, powerful wine, but feels tart and tight still, suggesting aging till at least 2016 would be best.",US-New York:Riesling
"The nose is still closed: There is just a hint of dark fruit. The palate lightens with expressive and finely drawn fruit. There is pepper-tinged red cherry, fine notes of cranberry and red currant. The fruit here is beautiful and taut; there is freshness, tension and real elegance. Tannins are supple and fine, and the body is unforced and fresh.",Austria-Burgenland:Red Blend

That's not a technical term, but it gets the point across.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay

The vineyard is on Howell Mountain and the imprint of mountain blackberry, black plum and dark chocolate is strong, with a touch of vanilla on the finish. Cellar through 2021.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Leather, toasted oak, dried red fruit and plum cake lead the nose on this hearty Brunello. The robust palate offers jammy dark berry, dried plum, toasted wood, clove, savory herb and licorice alongside a tightly woven network of firm, astringent tannins. You'll also detect the heat of alcohol on the finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"This wine is rich and soft with acidity rounded out by ripe melon and apple fruit flavors. The background is more structured, tense with apple skins and minerality. Packed with acidity at the end, the wine is crisp, tight and demands aging. Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Extremely smooth and inviting from the beginning through the midsection and onto the finish. Toffee and warm cobbler aromas start it off and lead to a textured, elegant palate with toasty, nutty flavors and a pinch of salt. The finish is robust, and at all points it's a take-charge wine. An amontillado for connoisseurs and anyone eager to enjoy the finer points of the style.",Spain-Andalucia:Sherry
"This is a strong, dry and tannic Cabernet Sauvignon, with intense blackberry, black currant and new oak flavors. Right now, it's immature, offering little beyond sheer power. Will it age? Six years is no problem. After that, the overripeness, in the form of raisins, may easily kick in.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This stunning single-vineyard selection is one of Italy's most iconic whites and helped kick off Soave's renaissance. It delivers pressed yellow flowers, golden apples, citrus, melon and mango alongside mineral and toasted almond notes. Already delicious and well balanced, it will age beautifully and develop more complexity for several years at least. Drink through 2021.",Italy-Veneto:Garganega
"Initially, this smells green, with aromas akin to salad. With time, riper berry notes and oak rise up. In the mouth, this has a choppy feel and edgy freshness, while flavors of stalky, lightly green berry fruits finish with an oaky, minty character.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Brooding aromas of crushed rock, mineral, black olive, soot, cracked black pepper, charcuterie and dried herb lead to fresh, focused flavors that are flavorful but remain light on their feet. It shows a bit more tannic heft than this area often shows along with great length on the meaty finish.",US-Oregon:Syrah
"A very deep color and smoky, meaty aromas get this full-bodied wine off to a great start, then saturated blackberry, blueberry and espresso flavors kick in. All that fruit comes in a firm package of fine-grained tannins to add welcome texture, and the concentration of flavor lingers on the finish, too.",US-California:Red Blend
"A widely available offering from Concannon, this Cab is rich in jammy cherry and vanilla, with a backbone of oak, a nice choice for midweek dinners of rib roast and steak.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Very rich and deliciously smooth, but with a bite of acidity and stalky black-currant fruit to give it structure. This wine is dry, ripe and dense, showing its tannins while promising longevity.",Portugal-Port:Port
"A light, straightforward and focused wine, 100% varietal, this offers cranberry, mushroom and a complexity of tannin and oak. High acidity dances around fresh layers of strawberry and raspberry on the palate, with a grippy, cinnamon-spiced finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Lifted notes of dried pear, dried chamomile flowers and dried lemon peel have a strong impact. The palate comes in with lovely generous sweetness that amplifies that chamomile-tisane notion and boosts the dried-fruit notes. Against the distinctly medium-sweet fruitiness stands a clarion line of acidity. The evolution of fruit flavors weaves a colorful tapestry of aromas. This is carefully balanced and quietly intense. It holds immense strength at its core that radiates flavor and fruit. Made from a field blend of Alsace varieties, each adds something: aroma, texture, freshness and body. The finish is endless and very fruity. Have this with cheese or a subtle dessert. Drink now through 2035.",France-Alsace:Alsace white blend
"This is a full-bodied yet succulent, supple wine, loaded with dark fruit. Black cherries and plums hint at sur-maturité, framed in a soft wrap of baking spices and mocha. Drink now–2020.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is a floral Prosecco Brut (made with 10% Chardonnay) with drying mineral tones and accents of dried herbs and basil. The sparkler has a foamy, frothy appearance and a generous personality. Pair it with appetizers or finger foods.",Italy-Veneto:Prosecco
"This blend of 87% Grenache, 8% Mourvèdre and 5% Syrah is big, bold and robustly flavored, showing its youth. Juicy cherry and licorice flavors are edged in smoke and tannin. The cinnamon-laced finish is soft and long.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Celebrity chef Florence, in partnership with Rob Mondavi, from Folio Fine Wine Partners, has crafted this delicious, zesty Sauvignon Blanc. It's so rich in kiwi, lime, tangerine, wildflower, vanilla and mineral flavors, it's practically a food group in itself, but bright acidity grounds and balances it. Great job at a good price.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"An eccentric, but not unlikeable, Merlot, with very ripe, almost baked, black currant flavors that have been well-oaked. Bone-dry, the wine finishes with the taste of exotic Asian spices.",US-California:Merlot
"This cool-climate, northern Italian expression of Pinot Nero opens with nice aromas of blue flower, small berry and white chocolate. The wine is compact and short in the mouth with a fresh, crisp close.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Nero
"Round and fruity, this mixes sweet berry with red plum and Bing cherry. Orange-peel highlights lift the midpalate. The wine shows excellent balance and a detailed, lingering finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
La Cala is a fresh and vibrant expression of Vermentino that shows bright notes of lime and lemongrass backed by peach and honeydew melon. That natural freshness will pair perfectly with fried foods or calamari rings.,Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Vermentino
"This beautiful wine further confirms the high level of quality in the Pinot Noirs from Dan Goldfield and Steve Dutton. It has a profusion of ripe black cherry and currant flavors, backed by firm acidity and fine-grained tannins, giving it grip. Its balance of concentrated fruit flavors and solid structure indicates a long life in the cellar. Best after 2020.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"From an estate-farmed property in the Russian River, this otherwise Carneros-based producer shows it can handle different conditions with aplomb, taking its foot off the pedal a touch in terms of power and concentration in this wine. Floral, soft and silky, it remains complex in red and black berry, with handfuls of truffled earth.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Pretty aromas of cola, rosebuds, dried strawberry, fennel and Dr Pepper show brightly on the nose of this blend of 55% Grenache, 29% Syrah and 16% Mourvèdre.There is a slightly charred flavor to the palate, where grilled black cherries and berries are intriguingly savory and lifted by crushed black pepper.",US-California:G-S-M
"Santa Barbara-raised Steve Gerbac makes a winning white wine with aromas of scorched lemons, browned butter and vanilla, sliced down the middle with white rock minerality. Broad, oak-driven flavors at the tip of the palate quickly tighten into a line of lime zest acidity that lingers, with white pepper and chamomile spices emerging in the midpalate.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This wine is both intensely ripe and veering on sugary, while not offering much in terms of body. It becomes somewhat flat on the finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Sharp, simple and candied, with blackberry jam and cola flavors. The tannins are rugged, and the wine finishes with a scour of acidity. Seems at its best now.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe and full-bodied, this is a rich and juicy wine. With tannins kept in the background, the front is full of blackberry acidity and jammy fruitiness that's balanced by the fresher black currant aftertaste.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"A rich and creamy wine, this is full of the ripest fruit. It has flavors of yellow fruit and pineapple, with intense acidity. The wine is powerful yet balanced, with a delicious acidity on the finish.",Austria-Niederösterreich:Grüner Veltliner
"Rich and aromatic, with a full blast of fragrant toasty oak and plenty of tropical fruit. The apple, mango and pear fruit that coats your mouth is round and ripe but not too thick or grabby. And the finish is perfectly smooth. Sure, it's a bit buttery and full, so no one will confuse it for Chablis. But in its class it's one of the best out there.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Chardonnay
"A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Nero, this opens with subtle aromas of toasted bread crust, mature pear and a note of wild herb. The elegant palate—which is made without dosage—offers ripe Golden Delicious apple, sour lemon drop and hazelnut alongside a refined perlage.",Italy-Lombardy:Sparkling Blend
"Dried lemon peel and hay flowers make for an inviting nose. On the palate, the vivid brightness of lemon brightens notes of tart apple and the merest touch of earth and stone. This is precise and pure, absolutely dry and magnificent. The freshness is incisive and invigorating. It's another one of those gloriously bright and unapologetically fresh 2014 Rieslings. Clearly a vintage for adults only. The finish is lip-smackingly clean and utterly moreish. Drink 2017–2037.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"Chard fans will exult in this spicy wine. It packs a potent punch of pineapples, apricots, tangerines and honey, and is nicely balanced with crisp acidity.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This is a creative if not entirely successful wine; its intense, lavish aromas are followed by a surprisingly rustic wave of fruit that has a spin of austerity to it. One-dimensional and rough around the edges.",US-New York:Chardonnay
"Monastrell (with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon) has rarely smelled this perfumed, rich and inviting. This is an ultraripe Levante bruiser, with a jammy yet defined structure and huge flavors of baked blackberry, exotic spice, dusty mineral and toasty oak. Herbs, espresso and toast flavors propel this rich red to a lush finish. Drink through 2017.",Spain-Levante:Red Blend
"This copper-colored rosé is based on 85% Pinot Gris and 15% Syrah. It smells of dried apricot and cantaloupe, while the palate feels fleshy and round. Moderately complex flavors of salt water and stone fruits finish full.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Rosé
"High-toned aromas of herb, cigar box and spice are followed by tart cranberry and cherry flavors backed by lightly gritty tannins. The bright acidity keeps the interest high. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Rich honeysuckle, marzipan and oak aromas meet bright lemongrass on the nose of this bottling, showing both the fresh and oxidative sides of the grape. Smoked chicken and brioche notes are prominent on the palate, leading to a tangy, botanical, juniper-laced finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Medium bodied, this fruity vineyard-designate has a peppery spice note. A touch of dried herb and a hint of earth carry onto the finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"The wine is undeniably rich, but it wears its richness easily, allowing the fruitiness to show through. With hints of wood aging, spice as well as peach and ripe apricot fruits, it is full of potential. Drink from 2015.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"This charming blend of Vermentino, Trebbiano and Grechetto opens with pretty aromas of white spring flowers, tropical fruit and peach. The palate offers apricot, pear and citrus flavors, ending with a refreshing finish.",Italy-Central Italy:White Blend
"The nose of this light-colored wine offers showy apple blossom and pineapple aromas, leaning into the ripe and tropical side of the grape spectrum. it delivers crisp energy once sipped, with very fruit-forward apple flavors and even a touch of guava.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Fleshy peach and melon aromas comme off as chunky and soft. The palate is just as soft as the nose, with melon and banana flavors. A simple finish is friendly but lacks spine, so drink this Chardonnay before it loses steam.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Chardonnay
"This barrel-fermented, estate-grown wine matches its luscious citrus and pineapple fruit to veins of butter, caramel and toast. It's perfectly balanced, lively and fresh, even after being open for a full 24 hours. The style, now becoming particular to many Oregon Chardonnays, sits squarely on the fence between the hyper-lushness of California and the minerality of northern Burgundies.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"This is a successful Pinot Noir in terms of its lighter style, silkiness and generosity, showing real finesse and delicacy. It's a tartly acidic wine with delicious flavors of cola and sour cherry candy. Try pairing it with mushroom risotto speckled with crumbled bacon.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is an attractive wine that maintains the steely texture of Riesling while also bringing out fragrant white flowers and refreshing fruitiness. It has a light touch of acidity, making it exceptionally adept with food.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"There are lots of rich, ripe vanilla, buttered toast and tropical fruit flavors in this creamy wine. Brightened with acidity, it will appeal to plenty of Chardonnay fans.",US-California:Chardonnay
"A big step up from the 2009, the 2010 L'Arzelle is nuanced and silky. Pepper, porcini and plum pudding scents grace the nose, while the palate delivers dark fruit, black olive and espresso flavors that ease into a long finish. Drink now–2018.",France-Rhône Valley:Syrah
"Seriously tasty and full-bodied, this inky-colored wine is packed with ripe fruit, fine tannins and firm texture, and needs a juicy steak or tender roast as a table mate. A core of black cherry and black plum is shaded by spicy oak.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Give this wine credit for dryness, crisp acidity and intensity. It's rich and strong in sour black cherry candy, cola, bitter dark chocolate and herb flavors. It's also very tannic, so much so that it's practically undrinkable now. Give it 4–5 years in the bottle, decant, and drink with beef or lamb.",US-California:Merlot
"Pronounced Kay-lee, this Syrah is unabashedly funky. If you like a wine with generous aromas of barnyard and garden, along with potent, ripe, berry-laden fruit, this delivers in spades. Barrel aging adds chocolate and dark espresso character to the finish.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Sweet, smoky oak and ultraripe flavors of tropical fruits mark this Chardonnay. It's strong and obvious in its appeal, but bright acidity and a stony minerality ground it, and the finish is thoroughly dry.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Dark-fruit flavors reach a high level of ripeness in this full-bodied wine while a firm texture of supportive acidity and moderate tannins keep it balanced. It's tight and concentrated now, so best to drink after 2019.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Fragrant and rich, but also with acidity and a tight, nervy texture, this concentrated wine has good potential. A single-vineyard wine, it contrasts richness and spice with a fresher character. Drink from 2016.",France-Alsace:Pinot Gris
"The bouquet here is confounding. It has some green vegetable and cat-pee qualities as well as white stone fruits, sulfur and popcorn. In a word, it's complicated. In the mouth, grapefrut and celery flavors mingle with green grapes, while on the back end it's chalky and rather tart. The overall acidity is high, and there's one important thing missing here: balance.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"Another attempt at a low-impact Chardonnay unfettered by oak, this result is curiously confectionary and sweet. Apple flavors veer into candy territory and the wine is slightly fat instead of crisp, despite the low alcohol and stainless-steel fermentation.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This is crisp and refreshing, although it shows little of the complex aromatics that some Rieslings obtain. Scents and flavors of green apples and white peaches carry through onto the modest finish.",US-Oregon:Riesling
Too high in alcohol and too overtly sweet in sugar. Tastes like an inexpensive Port.,US-California:Zinfandel
"This wine shows crisp apple and pear notes over a backdrop of minerality. Its ripe fruit is ribbed with anise, fennel and lemongrass scents.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Passion fruit and green onion aromas give a zesty impression even before tasting. On the palate, there's more passion fruit, underscored by underripe pineapple, a long, citrusy finish and a dry, slightly chalky texture.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"Tight tannins mask the ripe fruit in a wine that is set for long-term aging, so there is a dry core that dominates at the moment. But not for long: the bold black fruits are insistent and are going to be delicious. This is a structured wine that will be ready in 2026.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Saia is one of a handful of icon wines from Sicily: It boasts excellent integration of oak and fruit (although the wood presence is definitely felt) and amazing richness and intensity on the finish. The wine is dense, inviting and very long lasting.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:Nero d'Avola
"Big and concentrated, this is packed with tannins and solid dark fruits. It's powerful with a dark plum flavor and an impressive density of texture. Give it at least 7–10 years.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"This offers layers of toasted nut, chocolate, jammy black fruit and tobacco. The mouthfeel is soft and smooth, with a good deal of richness and density to drive it forward over the palate.",Italy-Central Italy:Montepulciano
"The appetizing perfume of candied orange peel rises seductively from the glass. The palate counters with the very fresh but ripe fruit of fleshy juicy yellow mirabelles. These are joined by tangy, zesty grapefruit freshness, creating a concentrated fruit-driven palate of great tension and concentration. This is a wonderful tightrope act between tang and generosity. The finish is long and clean.",Austria-Kremstal:Riesling
Tart red berries like red currant and strawberry dominate the nose. They also play on the palate where frothy lively fizz foams and disperses the flavors across the light dry palate. This is vivacious and very refreshing.,France-Alsace:Sparkling Blend
"This is a perfumed wine that has attractive strawberry and blackberry fruit flavors along with a stalky background. Fragrant and fruity, the wine is ready to drink.",Portugal-Port:Port
"This big, burly effort is structured and solidly textured. It has weight accompanying the blackberry flavor, with a firm character that demands aging over at least 18 months. The finish is still firm and concentrated.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"While the wine is toasty, burnt almost, the freshness of the fruit is very present, giving a light, lively touch to the weight. Give it six months to finally integrate.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Bright in cherry and cranberry, this classically styled Nebbiolo is light red in color and buoyant in acidity. A sanguine back layer brings the earthier elements of the wine to life. With not much Nebbiolo to try in California, this one is worth a taste to savor the possibilities.",US-California:Nebbiolo
"This is tart and briary in the mouth, with less-than-ripe tannins and fruit. This has a decent blackberry flavor. Drink up.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Very ripe and oaky. Bursts with pineapple pie filling, tapioca, butterscotch and caramel flavors. Could use some complexity and restraint.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This outstanding vineyard has a certain signature of Asian spices that comes through in its own wines as well as those made by other producers. Sappy red fruits and some high-toned bourbon-barrel highlights are at the core. There are additional notes of sassafras and sandalwood, along with those lovely Asian spices. It's a thick, full throttle, mouth-coating wine.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Bright and fresh aromas of black currant and Concord grape meet with violet and a sense of chalkiness on the nose of this blend of 57% Cabernet Franc, 29% Cabernet Sauvignon and 14% Merlot. The sip is bone-dry, relying on a graphite backbone and relatively light body to carry forth purple fruit flavors.",US-California:Meritage
"Strong scents of cola and chocolate come up quickly from the glass, and those flavors notes override the light strawberry and cherry fruit. With a bit of breathing time they all combine gracefully, crafting a full forward wine with a pleasing creamy texture.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Gia Domella scores with another fine Cabernet off this property, although this '06 is $7 more expensive than the '05. It's a dry, 100% Cab that shows an herbaceousness and soft tannins to the sweet oak and blackberry flavors. Now–2014.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This ageable wine has sturdy tannins and is a shade too young to drink now. A few years of cellaring will open up the blackcurrant and olive flavors and soften the mouthfeel. If you must open it, try with a perfectly grilled lambchop.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Spicy oak and honey offer an alluring start. Great balance combines with a hearty backbone. Friendly but sophisticated, it has diverse pairing potential—lobster, poultry, creamy cheeses.",South Africa-Western Cape:Chardonnay

"Forward and fruity, this is a tight, tart wine with a jumble of berry and bramble flavors. It's peppery, spicy, but don't look for too much complexity. Gulp it down for the enjoyable quaffer that it's meant to be.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Fresh and crisp, this light-bodied wine has fragrant pine, floral and citrus aromas, vivid lemon-lime flavors and a nice, tight balance that wakes up the taste buds.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"La Magia Brunello is a brooding, masculine wine filled with tobacco smoke and cigar box. At the back are tones of dried fruit, blackberry preserves, crème de cassis and prune. It shows wonderful intensity and elegance with loads of personality. Spice, black pepper and bitter chocolate also appear on the long, silky finish. It promises to age well.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese Grosso
"A terrific value, the 2012 Mount Crawford offer sup a big hit of lime on the nose, but also intriguing brine and talc notes that add extra dimension and complexity. It's a medium-bodied wine with ample texture and a long, layered finish. It may not age as long as some other Eden Valley Rieslings, but it's delicious now, so why wait?",Australia-South Australia:Riesling
"Made in a clean, refreshing style, this is a medium-bodied wine that bursts with aromas and flavors of pear, melon and ginger. A pineapple note on the finish adds zest and freshness. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Pinot Gris

"This comes from the northern end of the line-up of Premier Crus, which shows in the lively, crisp and tightly fruity character of the wine. It is developing slowly, still controlled and with light hints of toast. It will be a beautiful, bright wine. Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This dry appetizing wine comes from one of Lodi's more adventurous winemakers, Markus Niggli. A hot-pink color and red-cherry aromas lead to bright fresh cherry and raspberry flavors, while a medium body and mild acidity form a smooth texture. Niggli made it from Syrah and Carignane grapes fermented by native yeast.",US-California:Rosé
Sunny whiffs of Meyer lemon and peach turn zestier on the palate of this dry Riesling. It's a delightfully quaffable wine marked by cutting mineral intensity. Drink now through 2019.,Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"Made with organically grown grapes, this juicy Rosso boasts sensations of tilled earth, violet, crushed black cherry, red currants and graphite. It's savory, fresh and unpretentious.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Tough in tannins, with an astringent, lockdown quality. That's the iron fist of this wine. The velvet glove is the rich, flamboyant core of blackberries and cassis. Give this young wine at least six years to come around.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of tomato, balsamic black fruits and beef stew announce a blocky palate that's flat in feel. Flavors of pepper, prune and stewed blackberry finish dark and rubbery, and overall this is ripe but lacking in structure and mouthfeel.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tinta de Toro
"Ripe orange and spun sugar are the key aromas on this foamy, sweet-tasting rosé Cava. Bold peach, plum and raspberry flavors are more a mass than individually defined, while the finish is tasty but unremarkable.",Spain-Catalonia:Sparkling Blend

"Aromas recall white spring flower, citrus and a hint of herb. The fresh palate offers nectarine and lemon zest alongside brisk acidity that leaves a clean finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:White Blend
"Spine-tingling lime and lemon notes dominate this light-footed dry Riesling. Refreshingly mineral on the palate, it finishes brisk and clean.",Germany-Rheinhessen:Riesling
"While this wine is lean initially, it also shows weight and the potential of ripe fruits. Concentrated tannins still allow room for a little juicy fruit. The overall effect is of structure triumphing over fruitiness. Made by the team at Domaine de Chevalier, the wine will take time to develop. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Grassy, slightly green aromas are fresh and suggest cactus pad. This is easy on the palate, with flavors of citrus fruits and green herbs, such as tarragon and rosemary. A crisp finish is just solid enough to maintain integrity.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"There's something overripe and flat about this wine, which conveys a mix of Dr Pepper, chocolate and vanilla that doesn't impress.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon

"This Syrah-dominant blend, with 25% Carignan and 5% Grenache, leads with oak-driven aromas of charred cedar, sweet smoke and vanilla bean that envelop the ripe blackberry and cherry fruit tones.

"Savory wisps of smoke and dusty minerals juxtapose exuberantly juicy, sweet yellow peach and nectarine flavors in this crystalline kabinett. Just off-dry on the palate, its refreshing, high-spirited style makes it an excellent apéritif.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"Inviting aromas of molten chocolate, plum cake, purple flower and baking spice take shape in the glass along with a whiff of underbrush. The dense palate offers blackberry extract, cassis, licorice and chewing tobacco alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. It finishes on a confectionery note. Drink 2018–2025.",Italy-Veneto:Red Blend

"The wine comes from a small strip of a half acre in the center of this famed grand cru, part of the Olivier Leflaive family domaine. It is laden with toast flavors from the wood fermentation as well as intense fruit, green plums and crisp apples which are given extra richness by apricots. Concentrated and densely textured the wine will develop so well. Drink from 2022.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay

"Round and soft, this features white fruit flavors filled out by a touch of smokiness and light acidity. It's gentle, dry and full bodied. Screwcap.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese White
"Longoria has worked with this finicky Spanish grape variety for years, with mixed results. This 2010 is lower in alcohol than the wine has been in a long time, which gives it a delicate mouthfeel. It's dense in cherries, currants, bacon and licorice, but finishes dry. Easy to like for its soft deliciousness.",US-California:Tempranillo

"This shows the immediate appeal of Central Otago's 2013 vintage. Yes, the acids and tannins stick out a bit, but they're cushioned by loads of ripe berry fruit. Hints of dried bracken and chocolate add complexity, while the finish glides to long, dusty completion. Drink now–2018.",New Zealand-Central Otago:Pinot Noir
"Blackberry and other sweet aromas lead to a soft, mildly oaky palate with sweet, ripe plum and berry flavors. There's juicy acids and reasonable amounts of toast, licorice and spice on the finish. Not sure what differentiates this from Reserve, but the Barrel Select seems better balanced.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Merlot
"Green bean and bell pepper mark this wine that lacks flavor. It tastes watery and diluted, a faint hint of lemon lurking in.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Although this wine is easy to drink now, it shows the Williams Selyem signature of complexity and balance. Delicious in raspberry, cherry and cola fruit, it has crisp acidity and a sweet coat of oak. It's a blend of several vineyards from which the winery sources fruit.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"The wine is so young, it almost has a prickle on the tongue. It is very fresh and still rather tight with acidity and crisp berry fruits. Wait until 2015 for this fruity wine to settle down and open up.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"There is a sweet streak running through the fleshy fruit flavors of pear and peach. This is pure Pinot Gris, balanced with high acidity, sweet fruit and slightly bitter flavors of skin and rind.",US-Washington:Pinot Gris
"At first, this displays an almost grassy freshness, then fine bubbles bring out a certain savouriness on the palate that would work incredibly well with seafood, tempura or any number of lighter foods. If you are planning a dinner around sparkling wine, put this one on your list. The dry but rich and spicy finish call out for food.",Austria-Österreichischer Sekt:Sparkling Blend
"Smashed Concord grapes, lavender and more purple flower aromas make for a very purple-leaning nose on this bottling from the hot stretches of southern Monterey County. The flavors are also quite violet-like, with lavender, jasmine, black plum, olallieberry, plum blossoms, and dill, altogether quite elegant with a relatively light touch.",US-California:Tempranillo
"Density is a hallmark of all the Silverback reds, and this is the biggest of them all. It's packed tight and almost impenetrable until it's had several hours of breathing time. A mouthful of black fruits is set amidst a sea of darker flavors: tar, smoke, charcoal, graphite, cacao, licorice and espresso grounds. Put this one aside for up to a decade.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Forward and nicely rounded off, this brings spicy cherry and cranberry fruit front and center. There are well-integrated streaks of herb, a dash of stem, and a dusting of white pepper. Give it an hour or two to breathe, or better yet, decant before drinking.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Thick and concentrated aromas feature barrel-driven toast, lemon peel and savory berry. It's rather flat, sweet and jammy in the mouth, with buttery berry fruit and then a sugary candy flavor. Very sweet and soft on the finish; needs more edge, spine, acidity and clarity to rank higher.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Abelé lays claim to being the third-oldest Champagne house in Reims, and this stylish, sophisticated and thoroughly excellent bottle provides ample evidence that this is an important producer. From the textured, elegant, densely layered nose to the richly toasted flavors and the lingering, sensuous finish, it shows a confident touch with a continental flair.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"From organically grown grapes, this unfiltered wine is ripe with red-cherry flavors and freshened by acidity. It has a tang of tannin that adds a dry core to this attractive wine.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"The nose just hints at white pepper and berries, while the palate confirms they are indeed there, but there is such slenderness, such fresh acidity amidst the ripe fruit that this wine comes across as simpler than it is. This offers very honest, unadulterated fruit. If you are planning a picnic, take this wine along.",Austria-Burgenland:Blaufränkisch
"This is a spirited, funky white made from old vines, the wine aged in neutral oak. High in acidity, it has flavors of white peach and coconut.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Made in even smaller amounts than the vintage before it, this combines 90% Petite Sirah with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon from old head-pruned vines. The winemakers succeeded in coaxing fruity raspberry and blackberry around a fully brazen acidity that explodes on the palate. Softly textured, the wine is incredibly fragrant and inviting in white pepper.",US-California:Red Blend
"This is Long Shadows's 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, offering a sharp-edged wine with a brilliant mix of berry, cherry and black fruits, sparked by juicy acids. There's spice and chocolate highlights as well, with a purity and focus that suggests cellaring to add more complexity over the course of a decade or longer.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This bodega always puts out a charred, roasted Carmenère, and this keeps the tradition going. Burnt, roasted aromas of coffee, campfire and blackberry lead to a full but angular feeling palate with vinegar-like acidity. Herbal, clipped flavors are mostly charred, while herbal black-fruit flavors vie with even more char on the finish.",Chile-Maule Valley:Carmenère
"This light and compact Barbaresco Riserva offers ethereal notes of spice, root beer, white berry and wet earth. There's a hint of clove, cinnamon and natural rubber as well and the wine is smooth, polished and firm on the close.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"There's a muddled element to the nose here that recalls old wood or spice and in general, this wine lacks sharpness and focus. It tastes very sweet and offers high alcohol that keeps the palate ripping clean.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This is basic and mild as a whole. The nose blends citrus, apple and fresh bell pepper aromas in front of a zesty, medium-intensity palate with standard citrus flavors including lime and orange. For a refreshing quaff this summer, this more than suffices.",Chile-San Antonio:Sauvignon Blanc
"Medium ruby along the rim, with purple in the core, this Merlot starts off with ripe red cherry and plum on the nose, with fern and warm spice adding nuance. The palate is soft and plush, with grippy black-tea tannins supporting juicy red-fruit flavors.",US-Virginia:Merlot
A dark and brooding aspect of smoke hangs over the black cherry fruit. This is still a little closed but the palate reveals elegance and concentration and wonderfully palpable chiffon tannins. This is fresh and has pure focus with some hints of iron oxide and a slight dusting of pepper: a wine of great charm.,Austria-Burgenland:Blaufränkisch
"This concentrated wine floods the mouth with flavors of cherries, blackberry jam, milk chocolate, vanilla and toast. The tannins are remarkably pure, and the finish is dry. The one issue is high alcohol, which gives the wine a chili pepper heat.",US-California:Syrah
"This is a hard, edgy and tannic wine that has a bitter edge overlaying the fruit. It seems tough, although there are hints of ripe berry fruits that are hiding away. Some softening over the next year will offer integration. Drink from 2016.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"The aroma says wood, and that's what the taste confirms. To go with the wood, there is rounded apricot and peach-flavored fruit, open and rich. The wine has a youthful taut edge, finishing with the greatest acidity.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Terrine is a 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Canaiolo with a sweetish note that characterizes its nose. Aromas of honey-coated almond, cocoa butter, caramel and cherries take center stage.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Soft and fruity, this is a light wine that has tight acidity and crisp red-currant fruit. It is bright and fresh and ready to drink.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Aggressive cherry, plum and cassis aromas come with a hint of rubber. This feels choppy and hard, but lively. Herbal red-plum and currant flavors finish zesty and jagged, but with enough body to handle some inherent roughness.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley:Cabernet Sauvignon
"With significant amounts of Mourvèdre (15%) and Grenache (8%) blended in, this drinks more like a GSM than a Syrah. Cranberry, herb and woodspice aromas are followed by tart, sleek fruit and smoke flavors that linger.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Gaston Chiquet's nonvintage offering features a toastiness that testifies to its bottle aging. Along with that feeling of richness, it also contains balanced acidity. Full, crisp and lively, the fresh and fruity aftertaste is delicious.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Enormously sweet and soft, with glycerine, brown sugar, black cherry, white chocolate, vanilla bean and white pepper flavors, this is one of the more eccentric, heady dessert wines out there. The alcohol is ridiculously high, yet the Madeira-like sweetness balances it.",US-California:Red Blend
"The Encruzado, grown almost exclusively in the Dão is one of Portugal's unsung great grapes. This wine—perfumed, steely and mineral—really brings out the granite soil of the region. It's tight, taut and packed with acidity as well as hints of yellow fruits. Drink from late 2016.",Portugal-Dão:Encruzado
"This is an enormously rich, extracted wine, that's vast in cherries, blackberries, currants, chocolate and oak flavors. Yet it has balancing acidity and tannins. Best now and over the next few years, especially a great barbecued steak or leg of lamb.",US-California:Syrah
"Hard, lean and minerally, with mouth-tingling acidity and flavors of stone, herbs and citrus fruits. This is not one of your fat, hedonistic monsters, but will pair better with foods. The finish turns honeyed, with hints of peaches.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Torre di Luna is an Italian brand you can count on for value and good cheer. This offers crisp aromas of citrus and tomato leaf, followed by a fresh mouthfeel.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon
"The fruit is at the fore here, with aromas of blue fruit, wet stone and spice, along with a whiff of tire rubber. The palate has sweet fruit flavors with nubby tannins and a tart coffee-filled finish.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Aromas of French oak, spiced plum, menthol, exotic spice and a whiff of blue flower come together on this. The medium-bodied palate offers black cherry, vanilla, mocha and a hint of anise alongside fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"An immensely savory nose immediately hints at an intense wine, with salty miso and tangy, peppery arugula. The palate turns the flavor volume up, with the spicy intensity brightened by lemon freshness and a textured but toned body. A stony saltiness edged with white pepper makes this moreish and irresistible for a lasting, powerful but very authentic Grüner experience.",Austria-Kremstal:Grüner Veltliner
"The Grenache Blanc (60%) gives this wine its delicate aromas of white flowers, while the Clairette (40%) provides backbone and pineapple fruit. Drink this relatively soft, mouthfilling white over the next few months.",France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style White Blend
"This presents a rounded style, but still fresh with red fruits and soft acidity. It is light and fruity, with a bite of spice in the aftertaste.",France-Provence:Rosé
"This straightforward Barolo opens with aromas of rose, leather and menthol. The palate doles out sour cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, clove and grilled sage alongside velvety tannins. There's not much complexity but it's savory and already enjoyable. Drink through 2019.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"Vivid and snappy, this was fermented in stainless steel, with a small percentage aged in neutral barrels to soften the mouthfeel. It's spicy and fresh, with a mix of fruit flavors including grapefruit and pineapple. A touch of vanilla enlivens the aromas.",US-Washington:Pinot Gris
"A wine with a very mineral character, some weight, very lively acidity, rounded out with spice and pear. This is for long-term aging, over five years and more.",France-Loire Valley:Chenin Blanc
"Owned by Beaune merchant Louis Jadot, this cru estate produces some impressive wines. While its alcohol is excessive for a Beaujolais, it wears its power well. The black plum fruit and tannins from wood aging that are still very present will soften over the next year to give a rich generous wine with a style that is Burgundian rather than traditional Beaujolais. Drink from 2018.",France-Beaujolais:Gamay
"Give this wine credit for sheer exuberance. It's a mélange of cherries, root beer, sweet mushu plum sauce and smoky sandalwood, folded into soft, smooth tannins, and brightened with acidity. Textbook coastal Pinot Noir for drinking now.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Solid, foursquare wine, full of structure and fruit, bringing light tannins into play with black plums and sweet acidity. But the wine also has a lightness of touch, offering approachability as well as concentration. Age for 3–4 years.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Elegant and bright, this shows extraordinary elegance and finesse. It delivers smoked aromas of crushed granite and tar, with notes of dried raspberry and crème de cassis. The young tannins are already silky and smooth.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"This is a spicy, ripe wine that has fine acidity as well as layers of tannins and a dense texture. It is developing fast, bringing out delicious freshness and red fruits. The vineyards are being converted to organic—a multi-year process. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"ots of briary, brambly wild berry and cherry fruit in this robust Zin. Also lots of mouthwatering spices. It's basically dry, but jammy sweet also, suggesting pairing with barbecue sauces made with sugar.",US-California:Zinfandel
"There's an awkward note of alcohol here backed by toasted chestnut or hazelnut. After a few minutes in the glass however, the wine regains its confidence in the form of cured meat and ripe blackberry aromas.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This is proof that excellent Chardonnay can come from this warm region in Southern California. Key lime pie, peach blossom and shaved apple aromas show on the nose. The palate sizzles with acidity and a savory hit of sea salt, with a core of Asian pear and stone fruit flavors.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Blackberry and chocolate flavors intertwine nicely in this soft, round and bright red from a tiny site in the appellation. Lightly spiced with clove and cedar, it strikes a balance between fruit and tension, making it a food-friendly option that won't overpower in the glass.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made from a field blend of old vines, this is a dense wine. Full of tannins and with a strongly mineral texture (you can almost taste the dirt), it is solid with rich fruit, acidity and hints of wood aging. This powerful wine needs to age another year, so drink from 2018.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"A rich, powerful wine that shows great aging potential. Spiced and perfumed, it brings in dark, black fruits, tight tannins and layers of acidity. It has ripeness as well, with sweet jelly flavors on top of the firm character of the wine. Keep for 3–4 years.",Portugal-Bairrada:Portuguese Red
"With a slight prickle on the tongue, this off-dry wine is crisp, fruity, packed with citrus and with fine acidity. It is zesty, tangy and a pleasure to drink with its bright flavors and texture. Drink now.",Portugal-Vinho Verde:Portuguese White
"Powerful tannins are still at work in this structured and dense wine. Produced from grapes that were foot trodden in open fermenters, this wine shows considerable richness and dark plum and damson flavors. Spice and licorice add depth, while ample acidity and the firm texture suggests a considerable future. The wine comes from the Foz Vineyard at the mouth of the Pinhão river in the heart of the Douro. Drink from 2017.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"This bright white wine opens with a touch of crushed mint or basil followed by fruity tones of peach, citrus and peach. It's an easy, compact wine that would wash down well with steamed mussels or baked clams.",Italy-Central Italy:Passerina
"This Champagne is soft with ripe red fruits and a gentle acidity. It is an immediately attractive wine, with an orange-tang aftertaste. The bottling is ready to drink.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"A wine that already shows some of the typical oxidative character of Savagnin. It creates a wine that has great style, richness and wonderful tangy, smoky character. It could age further, although it's ready to drink now.",France-France Other:Savagnin
"This is a GSM rosé, loaded with watermelon and strawberry fruit, and sporting a slightly dusty mouthfeel. The persistent finish and texture keep it interesting all the way through.",US-Oregon:Rosé
"A precise note of crème de cassis is met with dense aromas of herbal relish, spiced toast and raisin purée. It feels medium to full bodied, with an open texture and dark, sun-baked flavors.",US-Virginia:Merlot
"The aromas bring notes of apple, hay, medicine cabinet, pepper and game. The flavors are plush in feel, seeming ever so slightly dried out. Still, it brings some appeal.",US-Washington:Malbec
"You'll find earthy aromas of truffle, new leather, game and pressed violet and whiffs of menthol and toast in this firmly structured red. The taut palate shows red cherry, crushed cranberry, cinnamon and ground clove flavors set against fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. Drink after 2023.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"The inaugural vintage of this 100% varietal wine, this was given two years in French oak, half of it new. It's wide in approach, showing full-bodied richness and concentration, its flavors trafficking in bacon, juicy cherry and vanilla.",US-California:Cabernet Franc
"Named after the matriarch of the De Martino family, this is a tropical-influenced wine with full banana, papaya and melon flavors atop lighter-weight aromas. The finish is equally tropical in style, with creamy oak mixing with ripe banana to create a sundae-like whole. The palate is chewy and satisfying as the wine tips the scale toward full bodied. Best Buy.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Chardonnay
"Named after a property that Bill Foley's family owns in Texas, this kicks off with citrusy crème brûlée and tight honey elements on the nose. It opens softly with French toast on the palate, then tightens up with limestone minerality and lemon rind acidity. Just enough buttery vanilla lingers into the finish.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Brander's Sauvignon Blancs are so rich in their own right, they don't even need oak. But when you take a good one, as this is, and add some new French barrels, it becomes even richer. Blended with 35% Semillon, this wine has serious weight and texture, with complex layers of citrus and tropical fruits, buttercream, vanilla and toast. It's a very nuanced white wine, so do not drink it too cold.",US-California:Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc
"Sweet-seeming oak aromas and flavors mingle with ripe fruit notes in this full-bodied, soft-textured and well-priced wine.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Soft Champagne, with a white fruit character, tasting ripe. The acidity is there, although it is unbalanced against the high dosage. The general feel is heavy.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"This is a big, smoky Lodi Zinfandel, explosively jammy and thick with bacon flavor.",US-California:Zinfandel
"The idea that Sauvignon Blanc cannot age is emphatically disproved by this impressive, mature wine. It is rich and concentrated, full of almonds, herbs and a great sense of length and ripeness. This is now perfectly ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
Rive Alte is a beautiful blend of white grapes that offers loads of aromatic intensity backed by creamy structure and fruity succulence. This wine is refined and elegant with an impressively complex bouquet.,Italy-Northeastern Italy:White Blend
"Plump and spicy, mixing mint and apple, with flavors running into riper fruits—pear and peach. This fills the mouth with luscious fruit, suggestions of vanilla cream and butterscotch, with just enough acidity to bolster it on through into the finish. It's big and thick for Riesling, yet beautifully balanced and quite delicious.",US-Washington:Riesling
"Reustle makes four different versions of this wine, each distinctive and worthy of attention. This is vinified in all stainless, and pushes sappy tart flavors of Meyer lemon and grapefruit front and center. The fruit is ripe enough that it leaves an impression of sweetness—a perfect counterbalance to the wine's natural acidity.",US-Oregon:Grüner Veltliner
"This wine is an excellent value in the world of big, rich Shiraz. While the vanilla and boysenberry aromas seem simple at first, the bouquet and flavors develop impressively with time in the glass, adding hints of roasted meat, mocha and black olive. It's full bodied and rich in texture, with a long, mouth-coating finish. Drink now–2025.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
"Made from 80% Sangiovese and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with aromas of tire rubber and sawdust. The lean palate offers espresso and roasted notes but it lacks fruit richness and intensity.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Though very pale in the glass, this wine holds no shortage of interest. Honey and roasted marcona almonds consume the nose, and the palate blends bright citrus, lemon curd and cinnamon, all propped up by a perfect, judicious use of oak.",US-California:Chardonnay
"You can call this blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Grenache a Rhône blend, but it's like nothing that ever came from France. Distinctly Californian in softness and ripeness, it has jammy, slightly sweet flavors of cherries, blackberries and chocolate.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"The slightest touch of vanilla perfumes the nose. The palate is fresh and takes a little while to reveal its secrets: slowly enjoy this and its peppery savory core will become apparent. This is a quiet, unobtrusive wine—give it time to breathe and let it come towards you. Its gentle harmonious lightness will captivate.",Austria-Niederösterreich:Grüner Veltliner
"The toasted oak aromas are still evident on the nose, so give this a few more years to unwind before opening. With patience, you'll be rewarded with tones of bright fruit, spice, licorice, molasses, brown sugar and tobacco. There's a hint of red apple on the finish, rendering it fresh and zesty.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Price aside, this is a fine, ready to drink, full-bodied Carmenère with earth, cola, tree bark, cherry and cassis aromas. It's full and a touch soft in the mouth, with easy tannins and bold flavors of blackberry, herbs, bitter chocolate and leather. On the finish, it's peppery tasting and mildly herbal. Drink now through 2016.",Chile-Peumo:Carmenère
"Aromas of scorched earth, mature dark fruit, dark cooking spice and a whiff of leather emerge on this structured wine. The brooding palate delivers black cherry, raspberry, clove, baking spice, anise and chopped herb alongside firm, ripe tannins and fresh acidity. Give it a few more years to fully open. Drink after 2019.",Italy-Piedmont:Nebbiolo
"This is a crisply fruity wine, with tight acidity and a nervy texture. The citrus character dominates, leaving room for only hints of riper red fruits. The aftertaste continues the theme of crisp acidity.",France-Bordeaux:Rosé
"Made from 100% Chardonnay, this sparkling wine is absolutely delicious to drink now. It has vanilla, cream, lemon, lime and yeast flavors, accented with crisp acidity, and the bubbly mousse is soft and fine.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"There is a light prickle to this freshly crisp and dry rosé. It bursts with raspberry and red currant flavors, tangy acidity and a lively finish.",Portugal-Vinho Verde:Rosé
"With a rich, caramel-teased nose, this is a full-bodied and voluptuous Chardonnay that evolves in the glass to display much greater sophistication and concentration. It finishes light and lemony, rounded out by juicy stone fruit.",US-California:Chardonnay
"90-92 A soft, juicy wine, swollen with black currants, having the freshest character in the aftertaste.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, rose, menthol, leather and a whiff of grilled herb lead the nose. The ripe palate offers fleshy black cherry, chopped mint and licorice framed in close-grained tannins that dry out the finish.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Pretty with aromatics of rose petals, this layered, complex wine offers restrained power and demure fruit. In taste, it's a mix of black cherries and that cola-like allspice that is prevalent in many Russian River Valley sites. The mouthfeel is round and soft, with just the right tension between tannin and acidity, with a protracted finish of toasty oak.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Lush and fruit forward, Rapture, whose motto is “Don't be left behind!” is full bodied but soft, with leather and herb tones and a smoky finish. Blended with a smidgen of Petite Sirah and reaching 14.9% abv, it tastes every bit of that, with a smoky finish of oak.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Shows the crisp balance and ripe elegance that the best Sauvignon Blancs from this region display. With taut acidity, it brims with mouthwatering flavors of citrus fruits, lemongrass, vanilla and pepper, and is totally dry.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"This has a plump, yeasty, leesy feel, with tropical fruit and lychee aromas. Flavors of bread and white fruit unfold on the palate, with notes of banana and papaya on the finish.",Chile-Central Valley:Chardonnay
"Interesting and complex,  combines sweet raspberry and black cherry flavors with earthy notes. Soft tannins make it instantly accessible, while crisp acidity provides balance. Turns simple in the middle palate, but is saved by a rich finish. A blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Merlot.",Italy-Tuscany:Sangiovese
"Ryan Patrick's Reserve Cab is a round, subtle and forward wine that does not over-reach. The tangy fruit shows a mix of cassis and black raspberry fruit, then opens out into a darker mid-palate with licorice and coffee running solidly through to the finish. It's broad and open, and falls off in the finish, suggesting that this is a wine to enjoy in its youth.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a light, fresh and crisply fruity wine. It is dominated by lime and ripe lemon flavors that come from the bright blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto. Not a wine for aging, so drink now.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese White
"Raisin and prune aromas are up front, and overall this Malbec is not showing any fresh fruit on the nose. A wide palate lacks cut and shape, while this tastes weedy, raisiny and green.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Soft and rounded, this is a full style of rosé, pushing red berry fruits, ripe strawberries right to the front of the palate. That means it is soft, with a relatively high dosage, the acidity acting in a supporting role to give some shape.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"The wine has a murky burgundy color and earthy, roasted aromas that include Band-Aid and latex. This feels bold, tangy, tannic and hard. Flavors of plum, tomato and stalky herbs finish with a stewed note and heat.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"There's a lot of richness in this wine, which has a pale pink color. You can smell fresh strawberries as well as a yeasty note and something earthy and mulchy. It drinks quite dry and crisp, with a real bite of acidity and some pretty raspberry flavors. It turns rich and complex on the finish.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"This is old vine Lemberger, one of the first red grapes to be widely planted in eastern Washington. It comes from a 1979 planting at the Red Willow vineyard. Raspberry and cherry fruit flavors dominate, pretty and pure, but lacking in depth. Some Lemberger can approach the style of Dry Creek Zinfandel; this is more of a simple red quaffer.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"The color goes from medium garnet in the middle to a light brownish on the rim. It smells like dried cherry, sage and toast, and tastes substantially fruity. The wine feels just structured enough by acidity and tannin for balance.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Sweet and toasty, with overt oak, sarsparilla, raisin and coconut aromas. It feels supersaturated, with monster tannins. Flavors of black coffee, chocolate, spice, pepper and licorice are rich and deep, while the finish is chewy, meaty and long. Drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Honey, concentrated pear juice, candied tangerine rind and a light botanical aroma show on this dynamic dessert wine. The palate is expectedly sweet but cut by a driving, mouth-searing acidity, showing flavors of pear and apple skins, ripe stone fruit, golden raisins and lemon rinds.",US-California:Viognier
"This is an immediately attractive and fruity wine. Bright acidity is rounded out by warm peach and pear flavors, with a mineral texture that will allow the wine to age. Drink now for the fruit, but it will be at its best from 2016.",France-Loire Valley:Melon
"Aromas of spicy plum, ripe berry, tilled soil and brown cooking spice meld together in the glass. The palate delivers dried black cherry, raisin, fig, clove and cracked black pepper alongside robust tannins. Drink through 2016.",Italy-Southern Italy:Negroamaro
"A stunning squeeze of fresh tangerine enlivens both the aroma and palate of this crisp wine that's high in acidity and dancing in refreshing tangents of lemongrass, kiwi and pineapple. Enjoy poolside or on a patio.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Enticing scents of fragrant white flower, apricot, pineapple and a whiff of wild herb float out of the glass. On the rich frothy palate, notes of sage and candied lemon drop accent ripe apricot and yellow peach alongside a softly foaming mousse. It finishes bright and clean.",Italy-Piedmont:Moscato
"Savory smoked-nut notes juxtapose ripe red cherry and strawberry in this full-bodied rosé. While quite substantial in mouthfeel, it has bright citrus acidity that lends some refreshment on the finish.",US-New York:Rosé
"This lovely, cool-climate Pinot Grigio would pair with tuna carpaccio or sushi. It's a balanced and crisp wine with layers of citrus, stone fruit and honey.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Grigio
"Rooty initial aromas veer toward animal and stalky berry fruits as this unfolds. Raw, hard and leathery in feel, this turns out to be low on ripeness as leafy, stalky flavors take over before ending salty, with firm tannins.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Bright and fruity, this has a ripe applesauce flavor that's cut with citrusy acidity. It's a great apéritif, with a soft texture and refreshing finish.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese White
"A bit on the dry, tannic side, this Syrah's astringency hides a rich core of blackberry and black cherry fruit. It's really too hard to enjoy now. Decant for hours, or try the cellar, although that's a gamble.",US-California:Syrah
"Still young, this is a dark wine with blueberry fruit and firm tannins both on display. It has concentration and the potential for juiciness and richness that will develop. A structured wine, it needs more time. Drink from 2018.",France-Loire Valley:Pinot Noir
"Starting off quite reductive, it opens to reveal notes of lime leaf, mineral and freshly peeled tangerine. The palate drinks dry but doesn't have the acid to entirely stand it up.",US-Washington:Riesling
"Generous, nearly fleshy notes of strawberry compote give this almost a confected edge. On the palate, this richness is checked by some lemon freshness and some bitter edges while the fizz froths in big, lively bubbles. Drink soon.",France-Alsace:Pinot Noir
"Flirts with being too Porty, with superripe currant flavors that are almost raisiny. But it's dry, and the tannins are soft and yielding. Drink now.",US-California:Zinfandel
This blend of Inzolia and Chardonnay has subdued aromas of orchard fruit and nut. The extremely simple palate offers suggestions of lime and citrus zest alongside brisk acidity.,Italy-Sicily & Sardinia:White Blend
"Intense aromas of inky, leathery black fruits announce a full, saturated palate that's bolstered by tartaric acidity. Plum, blackberry, raw oak and salty flavors are chocolaty on a finish. Drink through 2019.",Spain-Levante:Monastrell
"A deliciously satisfying wood-aged Port. It has an intense fruitiness, with layers of acidity and oxidated notes. It's concentrated, yet shows lightness and poise.",Portugal-Port:Port

"Great swathes of yellow fruits here, a wine that has weight, richness and delicious texture. Final spice shows through from the wood.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This is really mature Muscadet, yet it's certainly not too old. It is toasty, with almond, spice and vanilla flavors plus the concentration that comes from old vines. It is a fascinating wine, ripe and with considerable depths. The wine is, of course, ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley:Melon
"Estate-grown from one of the family's oldest Zin blocks, this wine is hugely toasty and oaky, with hits of bacon and dark coffee overshadowing an underlying layer of blackberry flavor.",US-California:Zinfandel
"This is indicated as a reserve-level selection, but at the moment remains unfocused, and even a bit dilute. Tart fruits and tight tannins never quite fit together. The drying finish carries a hint of wet cement. Give this at least another year or two of bottle age.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Still young, steely and firm, but classy and deep. This has the best attributes of the '05 and '06 Columbia Valley Cabs from Seven Hills—ripe and polished black fruits, firm tannins, a supple finish with a veneer of smoke and licorice. In other words, this is a complete, complex and intriguing Bordeaux blend, with plenty of aging potential.",US-Washington:Cabernet Sauvignon
"A blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and other varieties, this is a standard-issue red wine, soft and a little sweet, with pie-filling flavors of cherries and raspberries. It's light and spicy on the finish.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"This tangy rosé opens with a burst of tart strawberry fruit, and rolls into a lightly creamy midpalate. It's in the peppery, tannic style of rosé, making it a good match for more substantial foods.",US-Washington:Cabernet Franc
"Rich wine, full of yellow fruits, apricots and peaches that give ripeness. It has weight, a solidity that is balanced by the totally refreshing acidity. Hints of the wood aging give spice as well as adding to the rich effect. Age for 2–3 years.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"Winemaker Oded Shakked works with 57% Pinot Noir and 43% Chardonnay from multiple vintages, using pure cane sugar in a small dosage. Full-bodied richness underlies a crispness of tight acidity and fresh-squeezed lime and apple, finishing dry and vibrantly refreshing.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"This wine is produced from fruit that was sourced from Leithaberg vineyards in the northwestern corner of Lake Neusiedlersee. It's powerful with dense tannins that accompany the bright red-fruit flavors. Acidity cuts right through the solid structure, giving it a fresh finish. Glass stopper.",Austria-Burgenland:Blaufränkisch
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this has a rather subdued nose that reveals underbrush, tobacco leaf and black berries. The palate offers blackberry, black currants and cedar notes. It's already extremely accessible so drink soon.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"New oak accounts for only 30% of the barrel regimen, but it dominates this Chardonnay, with buttered toast, vanilla and caramel flavors. Fortunately there's also strong pineapple, Asian pear and apricot fruit, but the oak is too powerful.",US-California:Chardonnay
"The barrel aromas of vanilla and coconut are far out front of the fruit on this blend of Petite Sirah (40%), Zinfandel (33%), Lemberger (20%) and Syrah. It's full bodied with the wood overwhelming any sense of varietal flavors.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Smoked meat, olives and mushroom lend a distinctly rustic flair to this late-release Merlot. Blackberry and cherry flavors are pristine and concentrated, but accented by hints of barnyard and astringent tannins that linger on the finish. Drink now through 2017.",US-New York:Merlot
"California-based Siduri cellared and bottled this wine that was vinified in Oregon. Still young and compact, it nonetheless shows some good flesh on its bones. The tannins pop out a bit, along with red berries and a streak of coffee. Another year of bottle age would be helpful, or give it plenty of aeration.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"From a south-facing steep slope, this wine is ripe while beautifully balanced between crisp acidity, apples and pears. The steely texture and mineral edge give the wine added complexity. It's a fine wine, best after another six months in early 2018.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Whiffs of petrol, brine and fennel extend from the nose to the palate, adding a minerally sheen and a savory tone to the ripe peach and nectarine flavors. Lacy and crisp on the palate, it's mouth-smackingly good and easy to keep sipping.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"Sturdy and hard in tannins, brisk in acids, this Pinot will benefit from a year or so in bottle. It's extremely dry, with earthy, balsam and mushroom-inspired flavors of blackberries, black cherries and cola.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A very sweet wine that still manages to keep a dry element to it. It has as power, richness and great concentration, a smooth texture and final acidity. All in all, a wine that demands attention and aging.",Austria-Burgenland:Austrian white blend
"Gamy, rubbery aromas mark this sizzler with major balance issues. Sour flavors of currant and lemon finish with nothing but acid.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Red Blend
"Creamy textured wine, soft and ripe. It has attractive pure acidity that lies lightly on the palate, blended well with riper red apple, pear and just crisp acidity. Ready to drink in six months. Screwcap.",Austria-Niederösterreich:Grüner Veltliner
"Hints of smoke and wet stone combine with sweet Granny Smith apple and stonefruit aromas on the nose of this inviting dry Riesling. Smoke seeps through on the palate as well, melding with brighter flavors like orange peel and underripe tangerine, making for a refreshing yet deeply compelling sip.",US-New York:Riesling
"Planted in 1993, this four-acre, cool-climate vineyard had a relatively late harvest in 2005, which can, in the Pacific Northwest, result in more European, vertically structured wines. This is wrapped up tight, and is far away from the sweet, succulent fruit of California Pinot Noir, but its pleasures are many and varied. Clear and bright, its berry-cherry fruit is shaded with leaf and earth. The tannins are firm but quite polished, and the flavors meld together seamlessly.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"It's nice to find a well-balanced, fruity but structured wine that's dry and will be very versatile at meals. It has red cherry and cranberry flavors, firm acidity and tannins for grip in the mouth, and a clean finish.",US-California:Red Blend
"A cedary, slightly chemical aroma masks the fruit, and it is barrel flavors, more than berry flavors, that flood the palate. Overall it's a smooth, modestly-proportioned Merlot that's ready for near-term drinking.",US-Washington:Merlot
"Done half in stainless and half in barrel, this soft and supple wine boasts grapefruity acids and lightly buttery pear-flavored fruit. Medium long, fresh and complex, with a parting kiss of cinnamon spice.",Canada-British Columbia:Chardonnay
"A fine effort in this cool vintage, this Merlot-dominated Bordeaux-style blend is aromatically arresting, with complex flower and herb scents suggesting appealing delicacy. It delivers that in a focused, wine with pretty berry and chocolate flavors.",US-Washington:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This combines a majority of Cabernet with 4% Malbec for a huge, powerfully made wine, aged almost two years in French oak. It is named for the block from which it is sourced atop the mighty Stagecoach. It's reflective in leathery tobacco and cedar and fully concentrated with flushes of dark chocolate and caramel. Drink now through 2022.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is the personal project of Archery Summit winemaker Chris Mazepink. It's named for the bees that buzz around the vines. Rich gold in hue, it marries the flavors of ripe apples to bee pollen and lemon curd. The flavors fold into a well-developed finish, bringing up highlights of citrus peel.",US-Oregon:Chardonnay
"With a preponderance of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz, this ripe, smooth wine comes from the central Douro in Pinhão. It is fruity, with attractive red fruits and acidity. Tannins are gently in the background, leaving the fruit right up front.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"Lime, mineral and grass make up the pungent, pulsating bouquet. Apricots and peaches comprise the stone-fruit-dominated palate, which is touched up by a pinch of honey. There's a nice tang and snap to the finish, which offers a little white pepper just to make things interesting.",New Zealand-Marlborough:Sauvignon Blanc
"Concentrated aromas of ocean brine, sweat and citrus fruits feed into a juicy, minerally palate. Green, tangy flavors of tangerine and canned beans end long, minerally and fresh, with lasting acidity.",Chile-Casablanca Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"A single-vineyard wine, ripe with tropical and yellow fruits and with a rich texture. It is concentrated, full in the mouth with delicious juicy acidity as well as warm fruitiness. Its texture, cut with minerality, offers the possibility of aging. Drink from 2015.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Concentrated, muscular aromas of leathery blackberry set up a full, grinding, powerful palate with dark, earthy flavors of toast, blackberry and black plum. A peppery, spicy finish simmers with mild heat and burn.",Spain-Central Spain:Tempranillo
"This is a big, full-bodied Pinot Noir. If you're seeking a delicate style, go elsewhere. It's fleshy and precociously rich in cherry and mulberry fruit that's soft and chewy, like a candy bar. Such are the acids and tannins that you'll want to cellar it for three or four years.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"A delightful spray of cherry blossoms meanders from nose to finish in this standout Pinot Noir sparkling. Elegantly mouthfilling, it showcases whisper-soft cherry and plum flavors against a dazzling backbone of acidity and minerality. Grace and power synchronize through a long, long finish.",US-New York:Sparkling Blend
"A Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now, this has a pleasingly tart yet creamy mouthfeel, with rich, complex flavors of tropical fruit, lemongrass, peach and vanilla that finish in a swirl of peppery spice.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Blackberry and cherry jam and caramelized oak flavors characterize this simple Cabernet. The tannins add good, dry structure, but the wine still feels simple and candied.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sweet new oak stands out, giving this Cabernet caramel aromas and flavors. But the oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's massive power. Underneath the wood char is a dry, tannic wine with rich blackberry and currant flavors. It's a bit disjointed now, needing time for everything to mesh together. Could be really something around 2015.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made from classic Bordeaux varieties with Syrah, it's dry, rich in tannins and complex, with flavors of blackberry, fresh herb and oak. But it's quite soft, with extraordinarily high alcohol that gives it a Cognac-like burn.",US-California:Red Blend
"This Merlot has good plum and cherry flavors up front and is straightforward enough to pair with just about any food, but the finish falls a bit flat.",US-California:Merlot
"Minty aromas include whiffs of cola, bramble, animal fur and berry fruit. Feels creamy and solid, with standard berry fruit flavors, minty herbal notes and blatant oak. Finishes green and simple; a good representation of basic Carmenère.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley:Carmenère
"Really delicious, a sweet, spicy, fruity wine that's like biting into a raspberry, roasted almond, vanilla and cinnamon granola candy bar. That's no insult. The wine is dry and wonderfully rich in smooth tannins, and enormously complex. Worthy of very fine steak, lamb, tuna and salmon entrees.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Earthy, mulchy berry aromas lack freshness and clarity. This is a dense, meaty, thick Malbec with stewed black-plum and woodspice flavors. Used tea bag and baked berry flavors show on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Made in a more forward style than it used to be, Calera's '07 Jensen appeals for its lush raspberry, cherry, bacon, vanilla and sandalwood flavors. The acidity is just fine, and the tannins are soft and intricate. Lovely now, with a brief decant, and should develop for 6–8 years.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Gentle hints of smoke and pine wood hover on the nose. The palate has the same spicy glint of pine and some oaky smoky spice. The fruit underneath is lovely and pure: tart cranberry and raspberry are expressed beautifully. The body is soft and fresh, undeniably supported by lots of oak but it manages to achieve an elegant poised balance. It is on the finish that vanilla makes another appearance.",Austria-Burgenland:Pinot Noir
"Wild berry and spice aromas are herbal. This is not that lively in feel, with herbal blue-fruit flavors of blackberry and juniper. This is more green on the finish, which is modestly structured.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Carmenère
"Dried cherries, dried blueberries, fudge and licorice combine into a silky, sexy nose on this blend of 60% Syrah, 28% Petite Sirah, 5% Zinfandel, 3% Merlot, 2% Malbec and 2% Tannat. The palate is sleek though thin, with light boysenberry, dark slate and hints of vanilla.",US-California:Red Blend
"Dark toast, dill and tobacco frame this late-release Bordeaux-style blend, but there's still plenty of pristine black cherry and cassis flavor too. It's surprisingly fresh and fruity, balanced crisply in acidity and alcohol. The finish lingers on a sweet-tart berry tone.",US-New York:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The fruit sources—Klipsun and Gamache—are excellently displayed in this white that includes 8% Sémillon. A bracing, cool blast of citrus, white peach, melon and cucumber is buoyed with crisp minerality. The wine spent seven months in 15% new French oak.",US-Washington:Sauvignon Blanc
"The Sorella is deep and dense with thick textures and tannins. The typical black currant and black cherry fruit character is here in spades, and yet at 14.4% alcohol the wine avoids any fatiguing jamminess or heat in the finish. It leaves a slightly chalky, chocolatey impression as it exits the throat, and promises a long life ahead.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"A smooth, ripe and accessible Port that balances its raisins and other dried fruits with a drier, denser character. This well-made, generous wine can be drunk now.",Portugal-Port:Port
"One of a quintet of estate reserves, this stands out for its delicious mix of chocolate (barrel) and savory highlights. Purple brambly fruits abound, with streaks of coffee and brown spices. It's full flavored and drinking nicely already, with another six to eight years of solid drinking time ahead. Note: first bottle was corked.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Here's a soft, seemingly sweet Zin. Part of its apparent sweetness is from the glycerine of high alcohol; part is from the extracted flavors of raspberry, milk chocolate and caramelized oak. It's almost a dessert wine, but is nonetheless a good example of its style, which will appeal to lots of people.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Toffee, caramel and good maturity on this sophisticated wine. There is a spirit edge, but it works because the fruit is subservient to the maturity, ripeness and richness. The aftertaste is just perfumed.",Portugal-Port:Port
"Already showing a bit of bricking, this is a full-bodied Shiraz that's a bit coarse in texture, with aromas and flavors of plum and brown sugar. The finish matches tart, zingy fruit with sweet, molasses-tinged oak. The individual components show promise, but it's tough to say if they will all come together in time.",Australia-South Australia:Shiraz
"Luminous is an apt word to describe this sun-kissed, blossomy wine chock full of plump yellow peach, mango and pineapple flavors. There's so much more beyond fruit here though. A strike of lemon-lime acidity cuts through the palate, lending balance and vibe. The finish is long, accompanied by a delightfully astringent kick of lime zest. Drinks well now but should mature well through 2020.",US-New York:Riesling
"Summerland's new crop of Pinot Noirs is quite good, and while this is their least expensive and lightest, it shows their signature. Crisp and silky, its cherry, spice and sandalwood flavors make for nice drinking now.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Lush fruit flavors combine in a mellow mix of apple, pear and light citrus. It's a rich wine, creamy and fruit-driven, with substantial weight and length.",US-Oregon:Pinot Gris
"This blend of 59% Syrah, 21% Mourvèdre and 20% Grenache from the Sierra Foothills tastes a bit indistinct and slightly warm on the finish. It does deliver dark fruit flavors and plenty of vanilla-tinged oak. Drink now.",US-California:Rhône-style Red Blend
"While the nose is dominated by darker mineral notes of petrol and smoke, a penetrating core of juicy white peach and melon flavors flood the palate. Silky and lush in mouthfeel, it lingers long through a slick, lip-smacking finish. Drink now through 2025.",Germany-Pfalz:Riesling
"Minty, menthol aromas and oaky sweetness create a flavorful profile for this medium-bodied wine.",US-California:Zinfandel
"One of the original unoaked California Chardonnays, it's fresh, fruity, clean and perhaps better than ever. It smells and tastes like ripe apple, lemon and a hint of pineapple. The balance of moderate ripeness and mouth-cleansing acidity is right on the money.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This wine is steely, with tight acidity and grapefruit and lime flavors. It is bright and lively, with a tense edge that needs to soften over the next few months. Drink from the end of 2016.",France-Loire Valley:Sauvignon Blanc
"Elderberry and black cherry have a lovely tinge of iron oxide. Edges of tart, dark berries creep in, too. This is balanced and full of shimmering, intriguing fruit with layers of earth and minerality. An aromatic joy, beautiful already but with the potential to become even better 2017–2018.",Austria-Leithaberg:Blaufränkisch
"Citrus, apple, spice and flowers on the nose and palate give this pretty wine dimension. It's a simply good sip that will pair well with spicy cuisine and seafood.",US-New York:Gewürztraminer
"Low in oak and high in acidity, this wine skews tart and high-strung in terms of citrus and wet stone-like notions, offering a bouquet of lemon chiffon. A nice entry and finish surround a less-intriguing middle.",US-California:Chardonnay
"This is a ripe, fruity wine that comes from river plain vineyards of Saint-Emilion. It has rich tannins and juicy blackberry and black-plum fruits. The structure is comfortably cushioned in the generous texture. Drink this wine from 2017.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Crystalline cranberry, concentrated violets and rose petals and a shred of cola show on the nose of this upper-level bottling from one of the appellation's longtime stars. The palate shows graphite and dried strawberry fruit amped up with woody coyote scrub elements, reflective of the chaparral that surrounds the property.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Touches of smoked nut and dry clay lend earthiness to this crisp, light-footed wine. Dry in style and briskly acidic, it's invigorating refreshment with a zesty, lime pith finish. Drink now through 2021.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"A solid effort, in the mainstream style that you'll find on many restaurant-chain wine lists. Apricot jelly—not jam—flavors carry through all the way, with a clean, crisp, well-balanced finish. The residual sugar is just under 30 g/L.",US-Washington:Riesling
"Luminous and bright, this sophisticated dessert wine from northeast Italy offers abundant and generous tones of peach, honey and maple syrup. The wine is extremely lively and cheerful and ends with a zesty touch of acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Picolit
"Ripe fruit, sweet tannins and soft texture mark this wine. It's full, ripe and lightly structured. An attractive wine for its black fruit and forward character. Drink in 2–4 years.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Concentrated berry aromas are basic and hint at sugar beets. This feels jammy and a bit syrupy, while robust berry, beet and chocolate flavors finish a touch heavy and sticky. For the money, this is generous and plenty good.",Spain-Central Spain:Tempranillo
"This blend of four Italian grape varieties melds highlights of oak spices and pepper with just-ripe cherry and raspberry flavors for a tasty, complex but not heavy personality. The texture is mildly tannic, the balance is spot-on and it has an appetizing, crisp finish.",US-California:Red Blend
"This is a rich, bottle-aged wine is bright with lemon and green-apple fruitiness, but it's starting to develop secondary flavors—notes of toast, almonds and cookies—as well. It's at just the right stage of development and ready to drink now.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"Based for three generations in Chouilly on the Côte des Blancs, this producer offers a nonvintage Champagne that is attractively fruity, soft and creamily textured. Bright acidity is balanced by pear and white-peach flavors. This fruity wine is ready to drink.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"This is a good price for a Pinot of this quality. On the plus side, it's dry, tannic and silky, with pomegranate, cola and cherry skin flavors, as well as complexing notes of portobello mushrooms and sandalwood. It's a little rustic and won't age, and shows best if decanted before drinking.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Heavily roasted, leathery, earthy aromas slightly override the fruit tones. This has a grabby, tannic palate and burnt, herbal, earthy black-fruit flavors. Saltiness and blackened notes are to be found on a clampy finish.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"Warm and full-bodied, this opens with aromas of espresso, fig, dried berry, toasted oak and clove. The dense palate offers raisin, oak, roasted coffee bean and spearmint alongside round tannins. You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol.",Italy-Piedmont:Barbera
"Juiced rhubarb, plump sour cherries, ripe cherry tomatoes and essence of violet combine for a distinctive nose on this ambitious wine by Eric Laumann. The palate shows tart boysenberry fruit, a graphite minerality and whole black peppercorns, as if a wave of spice is just a bite away. It's tasty and balanced, but leaves the mouth wanting an even more full delivery.",US-California:Tannat
"This is an opulent wine from one of the fabled series of white Grand Crus. Along with generous yellow fruits and ripe citrus, it has weight and gravitas. Spice from the wood fills things out even more, giving the wine its balance, its intensity and its future. Drink from 2022.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This rich, structured wine is packed with both firm tannins and rich red fruits. Still young, it has all the makings of a dense, balanced wine that will reflect the great fruit of the vintage. Age this smoky, full-bodied wine and drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley:Cabernet Franc
"Briary and powerful smelling, with leathery aromas of blackberry and dark plum, this heavily extracted Malbec is grabby and tannic. Earthy, roasted blackberry and leathery flavors end with simmering heat. This is a big, fruity and gripping Malbec.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Dusty gravel and chalky rock mark the texture and nose of this 100% varietal wine, a sense of minerality that's uniquely its own. Currant, cranberry and an herbaceous streak define the midpalate, flavors that ride a lightly bodied, silky-smooth wave of nuance and elegance.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a fruit-powered wine, loaded with fresh pear, melon and tropical flavors. It shows no sign of having suffered from the wet, cool weather that hit Oregon during the 2007 harvest. It seems riper than the perfectly balanced '06 bottling, with lower acids and a streak of vanilla and coconut wrapping up the finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Gris
"This Merlot is strong and jammy in cherries and blackberries, with some herbs and spices for interest. It's dry and crisp, a nice wine for drinking now.",US-California:Merlot
"This is the producer's first vintage from this vineyard—the grapes were previously sold. The site, which sits within Green Valley as well as the Sonoma Coast, is planted to the same clone as sister property Quail Hill, in coveted Goldridge soils. Soft, round and decadent, the wine is full bodied, with bursts of red fruit and crushed stone.",US-California:Pinot Noir

Red cherry, strawberry and clove notes blend with the creamy texture, leaving a soft but lightly tannic feel on the tongue that makes the wine even more appetizing and complete.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Medium sweet (listed at 24g/L residual sugar), this includes 7% Gewürztraminer in the blend. Lime and lime skin are the first sniff responders, with more citrus and wet stone flavors following. Despite the sugar, it's a rather tart tasting wine, suitable for a wide variety of spicy Asian fare.",US-Washington:Riesling
"Estate-grown from a small family winery and entirely Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is savory in earthy truffle, subdued plum, black cherry and tobacco leaf. A complex intermingling of pencil shavings and cedar round things out. On the palate the generous tannins are sure to smooth over time.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Honey-sweet in orange and vanilla flavors, this wine has a good backbone of acidity that makes it crisp and clean. Drink it with vanilla desserts or even cheesecake.",US-California:Moscato

"It shows great depth of flavor, with delicious fresh berries, black fruits, balanced acidity and fragrance. The tannins are present, but given a great lift by the fruitiness. A wine to drink over the medium-term, from 2016.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The 16% by volume alcohol on this Zin is high even by Wilson's standards. It gives the wine a burn that it does not wear well. The body and flavors aren't rich enough to carry the heat, the way that a proper Port can. Richly-sauced barbecue is your best bet for food pairing.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Soft and simple, but the price makes it a pretty good value. Shows cherry, violet, cocoa and smoky oak flavors in a smooth package that finishes dry and spicy.",US-California:Merlot
"This is a thick and burly version of the variety from a rocky, high-elevation appellation well known for Zinfandel. Leathery tar overlaps with herbal, vegetal elements before a bittersweet finish.",US-California:Malbec
"Here's a smooth, easy- drinking Syrah that shows plenty of class. The blackberry, beef teriyaki, black pepper and leather flavors are brightened with acidity, while a touch of new oak adds some nice smokiness.",US-California:Syrah
"The color is almost black, and lots of dark berry and black pepper aromas come out. This wine's flavors are even more pronounced, tasting peppery, meaty and like boysenberries. Dense ­tannins make the mouthfeel thick and layered. A lingering finish attests to its considerable concentration.",US-California:Petite Sirah

"An elegantly floral nose is at the forefront of this wine, made from a Forestville site replanted in 2009. Concentrated in dark cherry and vanilla, it's robust and generous in oak and tannin, finding its balance on the finish. Time in the decanter or cellar should open things up as well, through 2020.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This pale, peach-colored wine is a blend of Syrah (55%), Sangiovese (28%) and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of bubble gum and herb lead to a bone-dry palate that seems to have a slight spritz. Tart citrus flavors round it out, with the focus on acidity.",US-Washington:Rosé
"A black-fruited wine with a strong sense of structure and wood, it has spice and black-plum flavors that are held together by tannins. This can age for a few years.",France-Southwest France:Red Blend
"This is a selection of the best parcels of the estate on the east Gironde bank across from Margaux. The wood aging (50% new wood) is apparent and gives a dusty texture to the wine without dominating it. It is a structured and ripe wine, showing the fruit of the vintage while also keeping solid tannins. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Lavender and lilac are just part of the floral bouquet that emerges from this wine, which also shows a blackberry vinaigrette element on the nose. Once sipped, it's like sucking on a purple-flower candy, with more lavender as well as plum and a pencil-lead edge that cuts through the palate.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Freshly baked bread, toasted hazelnut, yellow apple, ginger, subtle oak and vanilla are some of the sensations conveyed by this sophisticated sparkler. Made from 100% Chardonnay, it boasts a remarkably refined mousse and bright acidity. It also has great length and a crisp, dry finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Chardonnay
"Ripe, lusty blackberry, cherry and earth aromas are accented by woodsy spice scents. This is full in body, with firm tannins that provide structure. Flavors of mixed berry fruits, toasty oak and related spice run deep, while this Tempranillo is staunch on the finish, with mildly abrasive tannins. Drink through 2022.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"One of the top Vouvray sparkling wines, this 2012 is still young. That gives it almond, quince and pear flavors along with intense bright acidity. It is still missing the richer, toasty character that will come with age. Drink from 2016.",France-Loire Valley:Chenin Blanc
"Rich raspberry, cherry and mocha flavors characterize this Grenache, but the mouthfeel is off-balance, with its acids and green tannins sticking out. This exposes the difficulties of making great Grenache in California, even in the Santa Ynez Valley.",US-California:Grenache
"This is a 100% varietal red, tannic and soft, with slightly astringent notes behind the notions of dried cherry and blackberry. Leather, herb and tobacco all make themselves known.",US-California:Tempranillo
"Gritty citrus aromas are dialed down. This feels racy and fairly well balanced. Mild but fresh flavors of lime, lychee and tropical fruits finish citrusy and collected. This is nothing special, but it's true and good for Torrontés.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Torrontés
"Creamy and delicious, this elegant off-dry sparkler doles out layers of sweet white peach, yellow apple, pear and a tangy note of candied lemon drop. A silky perlage gives it a smooth polished texture while bright acidity lifts the rich flavors.",Italy-Veneto:Glera

"Dark blackberry, blueberry and blackcurrant fruits make for a ripe but extremely enticing nose on this bottling, lifted by aromas of vanilla, cola, clove and anise. The palate is delicious and rich with black cherry, but a zesty, bright acidity and chalky tannins contribute depth and length, with a touch of dill.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Bone dry and crisp, this is rich in New Zealand-like gooseberry flavor, making it mouthwateringly savory. Yet it's entirely Californian with its notes of ripe pear, peach and pineapple. An elegant wine to drink now, this would make for an elegant apéritif.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Flowery aromas suggest air freshener. This feels plump, round and oily. Salty orange flavors are just ripe enough to be good, while this pushes the limits of brininess on a finish that offers a taste of the ocean.",Spain-Galicia:Albariño
"This appealing offering has aromas of smoke, char, coffee and berry. It shows a sense of restraint and elegance while still displaying depth and balance to the lingering dark fruit and savory flavors.",US-Washington:Syrah
"This is a lightly wood-aged wine, full of fruit with just a touch of spice. Smoothly textured, the wine is all the better for an extra year of aging before release. That broadens the fruit while leaving plenty of crispness and fine acidity. Drink now.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese White
"Fairly light in the glass, this bottling shows sharp pomegranate aromas with a gunmetal edge and a touch of cracked-pepper spice.

"Fresh and juicy, this is a soft and rounded wine. It has gentle tannins, along with stylish acidity and red fruit flavors. Already, it is becoming drinkable, so don't expect the wine to age over the long term. Drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy:Pinot Noir
"Made using a custom crush facility based in Santa Barbara County, this Napa Valley Cabernet is dry and jammy-sweet in cherry and blackberry. The finish is sharp, and the wine isn't age worthy.",US-California:Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of grapefruit, tropical fruit, citrus zest, a whiff of graphite and an herbaceous note take center stage on this expressive yet elegant white. The round medium-bodied palate delivers ripe pear, yellow apple, lemon and a quintessential note of bitter almond typical of the variety.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Friulano
"This is soft and round, with flavors of sugared orange and caramel. It's an attractive, easy apéritif rosé.",France-Provence:Rosé

"Reflecting the vintage, this Pinot is light and lithe in style. It shows tart cherry fruit and suggestions of chocolate, with bright acidity and a thin finish.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir

"Along with a fascinating nose, this bottling from the appellation's westernmost vineyard offers the rounded ripeness of cherimoya, nectarine and white peach but with a laser-sharp line of crushed sea shell and flint minerality alongside scratched lemon skin. The palate rides that chalky line the whole way, offering hints of lime pith, tangerine, sea salt and just enough almond warmth.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Qupe reaches into the Edna Valley for this finely crafted Grenache. It's pale in color and has the silky texture of Pinot Noir, but there's an earthy, Provençal herb tug to the cherry and cola flavors. A dry, polished and complex wine with a crisp edge of cool-climate acidity.",US-California:Grenache
"This wine's suntan lotion aromas and mild volatility are a bit disconcerting. On the palate, it's full and dark, with abrasive, rubbery tannins and jammy currant and black cherry flavors that finish strong.",Spain-Northern Spain:Garnacha
"This fresh, informal white opens with subdued aromas of yellow flower and white orchard fruit. The lean, simple palate offers unripe pear, apple skin and a mineral note alongside crisp acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Pinot Grigio
"Woody, toasty aromas announce this rich wine. With the ripe peach and nectarine flavors, this feels generous and opulent. However, there is always that push of a more steely, taut character to keep  firmly in its terroir.",France-Burgundy:Chardonnay
"This blend of 52% Syrah, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon and 14% Merlot offers strong notes of green olive, ham hock and herbs. It's loaded with mesquite flavors with slightly astringent tannins, narrowing toward the finish.",US-Washington:Red Blend
"Sweet, rich and generously sunny peach notes on the nose and the tongue have top notes of honeysuckle. On the palate, the lusciousness is countered and given direction by orange peel freshness. This is all primary and still opulent, brimming with flavors. The finish is medium sweet.",France-Alsace:Gewürztraminer
"This wood-laden wine, spicy and toasty, also offers plenty of fruit weight, giving richness to the palate. Fresh black currants carry through to finish the wine with a lift.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
This offering from a well-known négociant is made in a lighter style and has good flavor. The essential ripeness of the vintage shows; there is some texture to the mouthfeel and it wraps up with a clean finish of good length.,France-Rhône Valley:Rhône-style Red Blend
"Strong and awkward in winemaker interventions, this Chardonnay is dominated by buttered toast and popcorn flavors. Pineapple jam shows up, accented with crisp acidity.",US-California:Chardonnay
"The aromas on this wine are quite unusual, with notes of wet copper penny, fresh sage and raspberry. Meanwhile the cranberry and cherry flavors are sweet and concentrated, creating an uneasy juxtaposition.",US-Washington:Syrah
"Candied cherry and raspberry aromas introduce this dry but fruity rosé made from Merlot grapes. Medium bodied in style, it's a bit plush on the palate but with concentrated strawberry and maraschino-cherry flavors. The finish is pure and refreshing, ending with a kiss of cherry blossom.",US-New York:Rosé
"A powerful sense of green powers this wine, starting on the nose with sharp grassy tones of rosemary, chives and pine needles. The palate is also extremely grassy, though balanced by a tart pluot character.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a lovely, elegant wine from the cool appellation within the larger Russian River Valley. Clear and light, it's stemmy and earthy, unraveling spools of cinnamon-clove, rose petals and forested oak around a soft, silky texture and highlights of strawberry-rhubarb.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Damp forest and dried cherry with cranberry combine on the nose and palate in this wine, sourced predominantly from Monterey County. Soft and silky it risks veering off balance once the oak begins to unwrap, becoming quite burly on the finish.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Aromas of finely ground black pepper, green herbs, orange peel and cherry are followed by tart, soft, sumptuous cranberry and savory flavors. The finish extends into the distance. It's all about feel and focus.",US-Washington:Mourvèdre
"Here's a lovely sparkling wine that offers a floral fragrance of white flowers and tropical fruit. The palate delivers apple, white peach and a hint of almond. It has a creamy texture and a clean, crisp finish. A classic Franciacorta.",Italy-Lombardy:Sparkling Blend

"Jammy and granular smelling at first, then charred aromas rise up and take over. The palate is round and healthy, with forward berry, plum, herb and barrel flavors. Finishes toasty and chocolaty, with drying tannins and a lot of spice flavor.",Spain-Northern Spain:Tempranillo
"This is an enormous wine, maybe too much. With its layers of rich black fruits and dark tannins, it is a powerful, juicy, jammy and super-ripe wine. It all seems excessive and out of balance. It's fun for a moment, but not for drinking with food.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Sharp and jammy, this has raspberry, peppermint and white pepper flavors. The name means “little kisses” in Spanish.",US-California:Red Blend
"There seems to be a bit of residual sugar in this wine, just enough to offset the searing acidity. Some nice flower notes highlight the aromas, with flavors of tart peach and citrus filling in the rest.",US-Oregon:Riesling
"Ripe malty berry aromas blend seamlessly with darker notes of toasty oak and asphalt. This Cab Franc (with 15% Malbec) feels big and pulpy, but also healthy and juicy. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and mixed herbs finish with oaky notes of mocha, coffee and toasty berry. Drink through 2024.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Cabernet Franc

"Saracina makes dazzling white wines, but this intense red is outstanding too. Dark fruits like blackberry mingle with bright raspberry in this hefty, substantial wine that's full bodied and handsomely tannic. It's dry, very textural in the mouth and concentrated well enough for a lingering finish.",US-California:Zinfandel
"Raspberry, blackberry and tobacco aromas settle in front of a chewy, round, solidly built palate. Medicinal berry flavors come with notes of rooty spice and resiny oak. A finely oaked finish holds root beer and dark-berry flavors that smoothly fade out. Drink through 2021.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"Melon and apple aromas are simple. This has a soft, melony mouthfeel and flavors of tropical fruits and honeydew. The finish is chubby, sweet-tasting and tropical-leaning.",Chile-Curicó Valley:Chardonnay
"This smells like fortified wine and licorice at first, then more like earth and smoked meat. High acidity gives this blend a racy quality but also astringency, while the flavors of blackberry, prune and licorice are very nice. It's tannic and strong but not quite punishing on the finish.",Chile-Maipo Valley:Red Blend
"Owned by the same family since 1850, this estate has produced a ripe Merlot-dominated wine. It is densely structured and full of black-currant fruits. The crisp fruitiness of the year shows strongly. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Blueberry, graham cracker and mild herbal notes define the nose on this high-altitude Malbec from Chile.

A pure and zesty finish is the right ending to this dark, lusty Malbec.",Chile-Colchagua Valley:Malbec
"Acidic, chalky and sharp upon entry, this wine's light berry flavors quickly give way to those tart acids. Though the fruit shows some concentration, it's a one-dimensional effort that has not completely knit together.",US-Washington:Grenache
"Attractive scents of ripe plum, blue flower, eucalyptus and baking spice spill out of the glass. The round, rich palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and a hint of chopped herb. Velvety tannins provided polished support. Drink through 2021.",Italy-Tuscany:Red Blend
"Temecula vintner Phil Baily is one of this warmer region's strongest proponents for upholding complexity over ripeness. This bottling offers red currant, cedar, leather and minty chocolate on the nose, while the palate conveys lots of herbal influence, from peppercorn, licorice and dill to minty black raspberry and eucalyptus oil. All those elements need more time to integrate. Drink 2019–2023.",US-California:Meritage
"Leesy and nicely textured, this has lime and green apple notes that rest on a bed of bracing acidity. It has length, focus and detail, all without intrusive new oak—just a small percentage of the wine was barrel-fermented.",US-Washington:Chardonnay
"Grassy red berry and plum aromas lead to a lean, somewhat high-acid palate with herbal, oaky flavors of raspberry and plum that don't last that long. Fresh and healthy feeling on the finish, but tasting more of oak and spice than fruit.",Argentina-Mendoza Province:Malbec
"This structured wine is firm, with still-young tannins. Perfumed black fruits—a blend of Castelão, Alicante Bouschet and Touriga Nacional—are crisp, with plenty of acidity. With its dry core, the wine will age further. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Tejo:Portuguese Red
"Kunde's house style is exemplified by this dry, complex Bordeaux blend. It's rich and ripe with cherries, black raspberries, cola and sweet oak. Perfect for drinking now with Cabernet-friendly fare.",US-California:Meritage
"The vineyard is in Santa Maria Valley and the wine's success is dependent on vintage conditions, just like in Burgundy. Past releases have varied widely. The '06 is right in the middle, a dry, silky wine with cherry, cola, crushed brown spice and anise flavors, but also with a heavy tug of baked fruit.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This is a dense, rich wine that balances intense citrus fruit with a tight mineral texture. It is refreshing, crisp while also concentrated from the old vines. The wine is young and fruity and will be better from 2015.",France-Loire Valley:Melon
"This Chardonnay has depth, starting with its unfolding nose of ripe Chardonnay fruit, minerals, hazelnut and citrus. The palate offers flavors of pear, citrus and grapefruit, its character refreshing and fruity but somewhat complex. An impressive white that can handle richer dishes.",US-New York:Chardonnay
"Don Paolo is a thick and richly layered wine that offers tones of dark chocolate, mature fruit, prune, blackberry preserves and rum cake. The mouthfeel is characterized by gritty tannins and jammy fruit power.",Italy-Southern Italy:Aglianico
"Ripe enough in blackberries, currants and mocha, with an earthy, tobacco herbaceousness. The tannins are potent, making the wine hard. Drink now, after a good decanting.",US-California:Red Blend

"This blend of Touriga Nacional and Castelão has produced an impressive wine that is packed with rich tannins and a dark brooding structure. Intense acidity cuts through the rich, powerful texture to give a fresh aftertaste. It is still young, so drink from 2018.",Portugal-Lisboa:Portuguese Red
"This blend mixes the estate fruit with several different vineyards, making a more fruit-forward, accessible wine than the single-vineyard offerings. Flavors show bright raspberry and tart cranberry, leading to some tangy acids, backed with earth, rock and hints of caramel. The new oak is gently applied, adding to the finish without taking away the wine's naturally juicy fruit.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Basic plum and black cherry aromas come with hints of baking spices and cinnamon. This feels a bit high in acidity and pinchy. While a quick wash of grapy, black-fruit flavors finishes without much noise.",Spain-Northern Spain:Garnacha
"One of the most satisfying Rieslings of the vintage. It's dry, crisp and exotic, with crisp flavors of citrus fruits, wildflowers and that famous diesel or lighter fluid taste that characterizes the best Rieslings. Really a superior wine that shows the brilliance of Edna Valley for unoaked white varieties, as well as the excellence of the Paragon Vineyard.",US-California:Riesling
"Freshly snipped thyme and bramble notes are prominent, yet unobtrusive against a backdrop of honey-kissed lemon and lime in this brisk off-dry Riesling. It's a zesty sprightly wine to drink young.",Germany-Mosel:Riesling
"Sourced entirely from the Milbrandt vineyards, this shows little in the way of either varietal character or ripeness. There are indications that some of the fruit was raisined, while some was green. A lot of tobacco, vanilla and oak flavors cannot mask the thin finish or herbal tannins.",US-Washington:Malbec
"Medium-intense aromas of pear, red apple skin and delicate sweet spice appear on the nose, while accents of toast and limey citrus unfold in the mouth. Vibrant and easy to drink with a clean, softly wooded finish. Try with grilled steak fish like swordfish or mahi mahi.",South Africa-Stellenbosch:Chardonnay
"The fruit carries a pleasing sweetness onto the herb-flavored midpalate. Then aggressive flavors of stem and grape skin emerge, though perhaps they're too dominant.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Here's a simple and lean Ripasso that could pair with white beans and grilled sausage. There are bright fruit flavors here and enough acidity to cut through meat dishes, yet the wine is fundamentally easy and informal overall.","Italy-Veneto:Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"A little too soft, which gives a flat, lifeless quality to the mouthfeel. On the other hand, the flavors are wonderful, ranging from cherries and currants to an exquisite overlay of oak. Doesn't seem to be going anywhere, so drink up.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Gorgeous violet and spiced red-cherry notes are fragrant on this harmonious Pinot Noir. Elegant and brisk, this has tart, sour fruit flavors that are accented by loads of fresh green herb and a crushed-stone minerality.",US-New York:Pinot Noir
"Just two barrels were made of this wine, a new release based upon a vineyard selection and a decision to use no new oak. Admirable in concept, but not quite there in execution, this wine is soft and earthy, with plum and a whiff of cocoa. The midpalate seems to have a slight dip in it, not a hole, but not a smooth ride either.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"Rustic, barnyard aromas give a wine that is tight with tannins and tough to handle. It is concentrated, very dry with only hints of rich black fruits. It will probably remain dense and tannic.",Portugal-Alentejano:Portuguese Red
"This wine is woody, showing concentrated toast and vanilla flavors. It seems to be missing its fruit.",Portugal-Douro:Portuguese Red
"Impressive for the price, because it's enormously rich, which makes it absolutely delicious to drink now. It's clean and crisp in acidity, with opulent flavors of tropical fruits, vanilla layer cake, buttered toast, Meyer lemon sorbet and honey. That makes it sound sweet, but it's thoroughly and properly dry.",US-California:Chardonnay
"Half and half Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this elegant wine comes from Premier Cru vineyards. It's soft and creamy, indicating a high dosage. That is balanced by the crisp fruit and bright acidity that gives the wine a lift. It is a fresh wine, probably best drunk young and fruity.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"The nose begins with a smoked Meyer lemon element, but evolves into fleshier tropicality, with ripe kiwi, white flowers and vanilla. The palate begins with vanilla, but then shows ripe stone fruits that trend toward bubble gum, with enough acidity and tannic grip to keep it serious.",US-California:Viognier
"This wine is so colorful it almost glows. The bright pink hue is a clue to the vivid raspberry and strawberry flavors that follow, giving an almost sweet, candied effect on the palate and finish.",US-California:Rosé
"Chandon's smaller production sparkler, the étoile Brut is 52% Chardonnay, 37% Pinot Noir and 11% Pinot Meunier, with most of the grapes grown in Napa and Sonoma though the wine is given a North Coast label. It has a toastiness akin to creme brûlée, a bite of yellow cider apple and almond that's quite savory and a medium finish.",US-California:Sparkling Blend
"91-93 A powerful wine, very ripe and rounded. Finely concentrated, with dark plum skins and opulent tannins.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The Wolffer Pinot Gris has an attractive, zesty character from the start, with its nose of melon, pear, citrus and spice followed by a fun, lively array of lemon, toast and pear. Pretty and an enjoyable drink on its own, or with delicate foods.",US-New York:Pinot Gris
"A lovely Pinot Noir, dry and silky and rich, with complex flavors of raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, sandalwood and white pepper. Easy to drink now for its sleekness and elegance. Only 296 cases were produced but a single-vineyard wine worth seeking out.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"This perfumed wine from a great year is rich in both fruit and structure, solid with tannins as well as ripe fruit. It is still youthful, dense and powerful. Wait and drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux:Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A good red wine that does just what Merlot is supposed to do, be enjoyable now. It's softly fruity and immediately likeable, with pleasant cherry pie, blackberry, cocoa and sandalwood flavors.",US-California:Merlot
"When a young Pinot Noir is dominated by oak, as this one is, it's a little worrying. Will the oak be absorbed in time, or will it always be excessive? This young wine has pleasant cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors, but the oak seems to have the upper hand. Drink soon.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Nutty and toasty, this is already maturing. It has a ripe, soft texture, deliciously balanced between acidity, grapefruit and riper peach flavors. It feels sumptuous, rich and certainly ready to drink.",France-Champagne:Champagne Blend
"This rosé gets its pretty eye-of-the-partridge color from having undergone cold soaking. Dry, soft and subtle, it shows peach, vanilla and spice flavors. Great with cioppino or grilled salmon.",US-California:Pinot Grigio
"Lovely aromatics greet you from the moment the cork is pulled, showing a brambly blend of black cherry, cassis, cola and a whiff of dusty barnyard. The tannins are well structured with a black-tea finish. Drink now through 2025.",US-Oregon:Pinot Noir
"There's no question about the huge richness of this wine—it is there from the initial aroma. It is smooth, totally voluptuous, immediately appealing. The flavors are of the sweetest runny honey, matched with acidity to emphasize the ripe peach and dried apricot flavors.",Austria-Burgenland:Chardonnay
"Sangiovese is still rather rare in the Walla Walla Valley, but if this is any indication of the potential, it should become a distinctive and valued variety as the vines mature. Lovely aromatics of berry, spice, cedar and toast wrap into a pretty wine with flavors of light cherry, ash and a suggestion of underlying minerality.",US-Washington:Sangiovese
"La Tunella has crafted an amazing Sauvignon that bursts open with aromas of white flower, honey, peach, jasmine, ginger and citrus. The wine is smooth and creamy with added flavors of honey and fresh fruit on the close. If you like Sauvignon Blanc, you'll love this expression.",Italy-Northeastern Italy:Sauvignon
