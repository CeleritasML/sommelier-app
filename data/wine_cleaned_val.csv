"This is a soft, unfocused wine that only hints at fruitiness. It is rounded and full bodied, with a touch of pepper as well as lemon zest acidity at the end.",France-France Other-Sparkling Blend
"Big and broad with fruit that is full and ripe, packed with golden apple flavors. It has great texture and sweetness, with a well-judged touch of vanilla from the wood.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Earthy notes of compost and murk blend with oak and black-fruit aromas to form the nose. While this feels a bit spiky and high in tartaric acidity, flavors of vanilla and berry fruits are good. A finish with plum-based flavors, overt oak and scratchy acidity is par for the course.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Butter, salt, pear and fresh-squeezed orange comprise the leading aromas. Bright orange flavors persist on the palate, as do green apple, hints of papaya and the near-chalky sensation of white rock.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Crushed red berry, black plum, prune, game and baking spice aromas carry on to the palate, along with dense black cherry and mocha. It's warm, soft and evolving fast so enjoy now.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Here's a fresh and clean rendition of Vernaccia with distinct notes of passion fruit, citrus and honey. The wine offers vibrant spice and lively notes of citrus that would pair well with Thai peanut sauce.",Italy-Tuscany-Vernaccia
"Here's another shining star from the 2007 vintage of Barolo. This classic expression of Nebbiolo opens with dark concentration and a masculine feel created by the wine's plush and velvety texture. Lingering tones of spice, chocolate, espresso, plum and prune appear on the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This vintage of Deliella represents an enormous jump forward in quality and intensity. Nero d'Avola vines grow in chalky soils, create extremely elegant aromas of dark fruit, chocolate, cured meat, toasted pistachio and barbecue spice. In the mouth, the wine is rich, velvety and long lasting.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"This limited production wine comes in a fancy bottle with wax seal. It is a rich blend of Touriga Nacional along with Merlot, which smooths out the structure and gives the wine its intensity and dense texture. It is a ripe smoky wine, packed with juicy black fruits and flavors of the wood aging. Drink now.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese Red
"This is a special wine that represents an antique and almost nonexistent winemaking practice in Tuscany today. A portion of the Sangiovese grapes are air dried, and the wine is refermented on the dried grapes. As result, it shows great intensity and dried aromas of cassis, prune and tobacco. Bright acidity pulls it together.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Now in its 14th generation, this domaine has produced a ripe wine from this single parcel. It's both structured and packed with red fruit and acidity, reflecting its vintage. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This rich wine, produced from old vines, is dense and concentrated. It does have the fruitiness of the vintage but that is allied to the dark-black fruit and powerful tannins. There are spice and wood flavors still developing. Drink this fine wine from 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Raisin, prune and tobacco aromas are strong but lack finesse. This feels solid, with controlled tannic bite. Blackberry, herbal notes and chocolate are the flavors on this good but basic Cabernet.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Light cream, peach and malolactic aromas lead to a medium-bodied nuanced palate. It has plenty of subtleties to explore, with a finish that stretches out.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Minerally as well as lemony and zesty on the nose, this is nevertheless neither pushy nor intense. The palate offers good acidity and razor-sharp clarity, along with flavors of pineapple and apple. Alert on the finish, this is a firm refresher.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Fairly light aromas of red cherry juice, licorice and dried violets show on the nose, following by a rather light density on the palate as well. Hints of minty cherry and charred wood also arise, as do grippy tannins that vanish quickly.",US-California-Merlot
"Aromas of red currant with a dusting of green peppercorn and menthol show moderate concentration on the nose. Medium bodied, with grippy tannins, the palate brings tart red cherries into the mix.",US-Virginia-Cabernet Franc
"This is a ripe and chewy wine with syrupy aromas of mature cherry, blackberry, cured meat and pipe tobacco (there's a 10% component of Cabernet Sauvignon that adds density and thickness to the Sangiovese). The wine is smooth and velvety with a very vibrant and bright feel on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Subtle but luscious notes of Mirabelle plum, ripe greengage and peach lend a seductive touch to this taut, structured and beautifully textured wine whose palate is reminiscent of bot fresh apple peel and grapefruit zest. Covers of fruit are tautly spread across spokes of acidity, creating a wonderful tension that keeps you wanting more. Authentic in its appeal, it's delicious now but will drink well until at least 2025.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Subtly perfumed with black cherries and cola, this is nevertheless somewhat chunky and muscular on the palate. Dusty, substantial tannins frame flavors of mocha, black cherries and baking spices. Best 2015–2020.",New Zealand-Central Otago-Pinot Noir
"Long lees aging (six years) has been good to this wine. It has balanced the bone-dry character of the wine, allowing it to fill out. Now, it is a beautifully structured Pinot Noir-dominate wine, with a light tannic character as well as hints of almonds and plenty of citrus fruits. Drink now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"There's a sweet edge to the nose of this wine, with aromas of sweet pineapple, guava and mango. The palate is cleaner with a more crisp, acidic edge that stays through the close.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Chenin Blanc
"Rich and ripe, with tasty lime, strawberrry and yeast flavors that finish sweet and spicy. The bubbles are a bit clunky, but otherwise it's a nice brut.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Darker and a touch more stewy than the winery's less pricey old-vines effort. Airing loosens it up, but throughout it's a big, stewy wine with extracted blackberry and coffee cake flavors. The finish is equally on the rich side, with swirling toffee and coffee afternotes. It's a big wine with heft but also some chunkiness.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"Strained aromas are followed by an astringent palate that's dried-out and tart, with an herbal, semisour finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Contino gives its single-vineyard Graciano all that it can, and still the wine, despite its deep purple color, is tight as a drum. There's juniper and blueberry on the nose, and then tangy blackberry flavors with an herbal slant. As varietal Graciano goes, this is nicely done. But it's up to you to decide if varietal Graciano is worth $147 a pop.",Spain-Northern Spain-Graciano
"At the moment, this is a tight, young wine with fruit that is masked. There is some potential that will give a wine with apple flavors. Wait to drink this until 2017.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"The wonderful thing about Sauvignon from Friuli (in northeast Italy) is that environmental factors like soil, temperature and geography, give the variety more heft and density than you might find elsewhere. This expression shows the grape's characteristic aromas with a touch of smooth creaminess on the finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"This zesty red has pretty aromas that suggest small red berry, blue flower and a whiff of moist soil. The vibrant palate offers sour cherry, pomegranate and a hint of anise alongside zesty acidity and refined tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Starts off with slightly confectionary cherry fruit, accented by peppery spice aromas and flavors. The structure is extremely soft, definitely making it a drink-now sort of wine.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is the little brother of Brumont's estate wines such as Montus and Bouscassé. It is all fruit, the 80% Tannat tamed easily, leaving a modicum of tannins to support the juicy black fruit. It is a ripe wine that is very ready to drink.",France-Southwest France-Tannat-Cabernet
"Powerful scents of black olive, brine, seaweed and umami introduce this classic Syrah from the heart of what's known as The Rocks District in Walla Walla. The flavors are a complex mix of iron, rock, saline minerality and crushed raspberries. The No Girls project is distinct from Cayuse, sourced exclusively from the La Paciencia Vineyard, and provides a showcase for wines with elegant aromatics, great balance, length and complexity.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This blend has a slightly meaty, chicken-broth aroma from the Sémillon, and toasty, buttery flavors from the Chardonnay, followed by a lingering finish. It is medium bodied, silky, smooth and elegant.",US-California-White Blend
"Displays a cooler climate profile with notes of lime leaf, quinine, white peach and flowers. The palate drinks off dry, with well balanced acidity and a stone-fruit-filled finish.",US-Washington-Riesling
This is a dry rosé with crisp acidity and smooth strawberry fruits. It is light and soft with a gentle texture that is lightly perfumed and with some citrus zest. Drink now.,Portugal-Lisboa-Rosé
"Cherry, cassis and plum aromas are clean as polished glass. This feels fruity and firm, with good flow. Peppery blackberry and minerally cassis are the lead flavors, whiile the finish brings schisty minerality and integrated but noted acidity. Best from 2016–2019.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"In this wine, herbal, green flavors bring out a bright, fruity character. It's fresh and crisp, while also having ripe green fruits and a light touch of spice. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"A bit over the top, thickly layered with dried apricots, honey and dried spices. This is one rich, sweet BA, with surprisingly apparent alcohol (9.5%). It finishes a bit low in acid, making it impressive but not classic. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Germany-Mosel-Saar-Ruwer-Riesling
"This is creamier than the norm thanks to its tight, persistent bubbles that feel frothy and soft in the mouth. Lemongrass, fresh field flowers, citrus and white stone characterize its typical Prosecco aromas.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"Apart from its quite heavy bottle, this is a fine wine. It has great black plum and berry aromas that are balanced by wood aging. The tannins, direct, firm and dense, bring out the best in the juicy fruitiness and give shape. At the end, this structure, combined with acidity, promise good aging. Drink from 2016.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
"Neutral and luminous with candy-like notes of butterscotch and caramel, this fresh Pinot Grigio follows through with stone fruit and ripe grapefruit. Lemon meringue pie and peach cream appear on the chewy finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Scratchy aromas of raspberry and licorice gumdrop precede a grabby, sticky palate with raw tannins. Plum and berry flavors are standard for Malbec, while the finish shows a mild baked character.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A touch blossomy against a core of ripe raspberry and cherry perfume, the nose on this traditional-method Pinot Noir sparkler is particularly alluring. The palate is elegant and fresh, marked by fine, mouthfilling mousse and delicate raspberry-candy finish.",US-New York-Sparkling Blend
"Rich and heady on the nose in petrol and sublime vanilla crème brûlée, the palate is intriguingly more restrained, offering honey and pear balanced by persistent minerality that finds its voice most forcefully on the lean, refreshing finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Stalky, leathery, roasted aromas are muddled. This is acidic on the palate, with a gritty mouthfeel. Flavors of stalky, herbal berry fruits lack purity, while the finish is hollow and bitter tasting.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro
"Spice, berry, earth, leather, tobacco and blue flower aromas lead the nose of this elegant wine. The ripe, round palate delivers fleshy black cherry and raspberry, accented by white pepper and cinnamon and framed by polished tannins. Drink 2015–2019.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"Concentrated in toasted marshmallow and juicy blackberry, this is a large, full-bodied wine marked by puckering tannins that still need time to resolve. Powerfully built, it's big on flavor and intensity, with vanilla on the finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Warm and ripe, this has fine honey and yellow fruit flavors. It has well-integrated acidity, with a touch of apple that lends a crisp finish.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Heady floral aromas of white spring flowers come with accents of exotic fruit and cut grass. The juicy fruit palate offers pineapple, mango and papaya. Crisp acidity leaves a clean finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"Substantial and varietally precise, this shows nicely focused red and black fruits with a concentrated backing of toast, coffee grounds, baking spices and chocolate. The fruit and barrel flavors are perfectly integrated, dusty and lush.",US-Washington-Syrah
"There's nothing flashy about this dry, delicately framed Riesling. It's quietly elegant, focused on pristine lemon and lime flavors, along with bitter citrus pith on the finish.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"This attractive, family-owned estate has produced a fruity, crisp and light wine. With its orange-zest acidity, citrus fruits and a tight, mineral character, it is a light wine—bone dry with just a touch of pepper at the end.",France-Provence-Rosé
"A touch of earth and the purest expression possible of tart ripe red apple immediately draws you in on the nose. The absolutely dry palate also has a touch of that earthiness and adds more apple-peel notions to the fruit while a vivid lemon brightness takes center stage. This is generous and earthy in a typically Alsatian idiom but then that freshness kicks in and takes this to another level. It channels and guides all the energy and power of this site into alluring dynamics on the palate. The finish is dry, long and lovely. Drink 2017–2030.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"A blend of 80% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot and 10% Syrah, this was our favorite of the Montemassi wines. Spice and meat accents plum and chocolate flavors, while the mouthfeel is full and velvety smooth. Drink now–2015.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A grilled steak will play nicely against the tannins and acids of this Syrah, grown in the cool Carneros district north of San Francisco. The black peppercorn and blackberry flavors suggest a butter-enriched wine reduction sauce. Best now and for a couple years.",US-California-Syrah
"Produced in the Vallée Noble sub-region in Soultzmatt, this is ripe and powerfully rich. It is strongly perfumed, full of white fruit and very floral in character. A thread of minerality runs through this still-young wine giving structure. Drink from 2017.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Ripe but rather light aromas of pear cider, honeydew melon and cherimoya make for an approachable, familiar nose on this appellation blend wine. Lots of soft nectarine and melon elements define the palate, with a pinch of sweet herbs, proving light, pleasant and playful.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Roasted at first, with smoked ham and bacon aromas along with clove and other hard spice notes. The palate is oaky, with chewy tannins and a thick texture; flavors of blackberry are meaty and rich, while clove and more dry spices reappear on the finish. A different breed for Mendoza.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"The scent of lemon and orange flesh is contained by lovely zestiness on the nose. The palate is no different and holds ripe juicy stone fruit with exquisitely drawn tangy zestiness. This is concentrated and refreshing, energetic, serious and lively. Its lemony verve characterizes everything from the first whiff to the lasting finish. This is racy and delicious now but will drink well from 2019 through 2035.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"The Aveleda estate is the source of the fruit for this dry, delicious Vinho Verde. It's a reference for the food-friendly, lemon and grapefruit style, adding minerality and a taut texture to the forward fruitiness. Drink this summer, or hold for up to six months.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White
"Aged in equal parts French and American oak (43% new), this initially puts barrel tones in the lead. Notes of toasty spices, cocoa, toffee and coffee come out in front of blue and black fruit. The flavors are sweet but reserved in style, trailing toward the finish. There's a lot to enjoy but the oak seems a little overweighted for the fruit that's in the bottle.",US-Washington-Malbec
"This is an easy, fruit-driven Chianti Classico that shows cherry, white almond and pressed violets. There's a darker side in the mouth that translates into raw notes of cola and smoked bresaola.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"An impressively structured wine, this great blend of Négrette, Syrah and Malbec shows intense tannins underlying powerful juicy black fruit flavors. Aromatic, spicy and driven by its dry texture, it should age for several years.",France-Southwest France-Red Blend
"This is the first offering of this wine where Cabernet Franc (37%) takes the lead, blended with Cabernet Sauvignon (27%), Merlot (23%), Malbec (7%) and Petit Verdot. It's drinking young now, with wound-up herbs, cherry, chocolate and cranberry flavors backed by firm, gripping tannins. It will be best after 2021.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Perfumed berry, rose, fragrant blue flower, tilled earth, baking spice and a hint of new leather are just some of the aromas you'll find on this dazzling red. The polished, structured palate is loaded with finesse, delivering a wonderful depth of flavors including raspberry, dark cherry, licorice, mint and white pepper. Vibrant acidity and firm, refined tannins provide impeccable balance. It's still young and will develop even more complexity over the next 10–15 years. Drink 2020–2035.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A fine example of white Hermitage, Chapoutier's 2007 Chante-Alouette boasts attractive aromas of crushed stone, honey and pineapple, while in the mouth the wine goes down easily, flowing along like a gentle, honeyed stream. Harmonious. Drink now–2014, or after 2019 if you prefer aged Hermitage.",France-Rhône Valley-Marsanne
"This dusty, tannic wine from the Oak Knoll District is rich with cedar, graphite and herb notes that complement its black cherry fruit.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Riper and fruitier than last year's release, a big, juicy wine that rewards the palate with layers of blackberry and cherry on top of the usual cola, tomato and rhubarb flavors. Structurally, it's a big wine, with firm tannins. I would cellar this until next year.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"An absolutely lovely wine, made in the modern, soft style, but with great structural integrity. The delicious flavors come in waves of currants, wild berries, peppery spices, chocolate-covered mint, licorice and cedary oak influences. Fully drinkable now due to the finely ground, velvety tannins.",US-California-Red Blend
"Blended from Muns Vineyard near the mountaintop and Wiedemen Ranch near the base of the appellation, this bottling offers cola, black plum, Concord grape and dried rose petal scents on the complex and elegant nose. The flavors are layered and woven on the palate, evoking elderberry, charcoal and purple flower touches.",US-California-Syrah
"No information was given as far as whether this was entirely stainless fermented, but that is the clear impression. Light fruit flavors of apple, pear, and green banana combine in a crisp wine that is modest in scale, balanced and fresh.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"The local Baga grape makes an appearance in this blend, creating a firm texture with solid tannins. Its rich, dense core is dark and brooding in character, but could soften out with age. Drink after 2015.",Portugal-Bairrada-Portuguese Red
"Intended as a take on Rioja, this is noticeably volatile, dusty and loaded with chocolaty barrel flavors. Cocoa and raspberry are in the mix, but it's chocolate that runs away with the finish.",US-Oregon-Tempranillo
"There's a fine texture to this simple, fruity wine. It has fresh acidity and a creamy character. A yeasty element doesn't quite fit with the rest of the wine and leaves a bitter taste.",France-Burgundy-Sparkling Blend
"Made entirely from Pinot Nero, this Franciacorta rosé has a subdued fragrance that reveals notes of strawberry, grapefruit and nut. The linear, refreshing palate shows bright cherry flavors and closes on a note of toasted almond.",Italy-Lombardy-Pinot Nero
"From a rare vineyard growing the variety in Carneros, this wine has a pleasing rustic nature, with characteristics of leather and salty black olive knotted around juicy blackberry and blueberry. Remaining vibrant on the palate rather than heavy, the acidity balanced, it shows bacon and oak on the finish.",US-California-Syrah
"This 60-40 blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet is a plush, modern wine with thick layers of cherry, spice, tobacco and lingering nuances of ripe fruit.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Here's a great value option for those looking for a chilled summer sipper by the pool or at an outdoor picnic. The wine is light and lean, but it also shows a very lively mouthfeel followed by sharp perlage, honey and peach.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"This is a chunky, blocky, rather stolid take on what is usually a floral, perfumed grape. Here it is limited to thick fruit components —orange and guava—tart acids and some residual sweetness.",US-Washington-Gewürztraminer
"The nose on this wine is condensed and tight, with snappy berry aromas that come across fresh. The palate feel is lively and juicy, while flavors of plum, berry and tobacco are honest and appealing. Straightforward and convincing as a whole, with a solid structure. Drink now through 2017.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"Earthy tones envelop orange-flesh flavors on the nose. On the palate they seemingly coat a lovely core of fresh, lemony verve that occasionally peeps through the rounded, fleshy mouthfeel. This is a restrained Gewurztraminer but not without intrigue.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"With its extraordinary texture, bright personality and complex medley of aromas, this is a lovely Merlot. The aromatic layers here include red cherry, earthy tones, exotic spice and cinnamon. The mouthfeel is smooth and gorgeous with delicious softness and opulent richness. Drink after 2015.",Italy-Tuscany-Merlot
"This is a warm and rich wine from the southern Mâcon region. It is ripe with yellow fruits, crisp apples and a touch of minerality that gives the tangy texture. Packed with fruit as well as structured, this wine can be drunk now, although better from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Aged 18 months in older wood barrels, this wine is bold and rich, while also stylish and balanced.The firm layer of tannins comes from the smoky wood aging as well as from the rich fruits. Concentrated and firm at this stage, the wine needs time. Drink from 2019.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Dusty, stony minerality penetrates from start to finish on this dry, full-bodied Riesling. The palate is austere in flavor with bristling notes of lemon pith and dried herbs, but the mouthfeel is rich and round with a luscious mineral-oil viscosity.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Three quarters Merlot, with 17% Cabernet Franc and 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a bit lighter than the 2007 Merlot, but just as good, if not better. Lush and loaded with black cherry, blackberry, cocoa and baking spices, it extends deliciously and seamlessly into a long, ripe, smooth finish.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Tropical on the nose, with floral, lychee aromas that seem more like Torrontés than typical Sauvignon Blanc. In the mouth, the feel is basic, with sweet flavors of lychee, mango and melon. Vacuous on the finish, but overall it's not going to turn anyone off.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Sauvignon Blanc
"This Bayle-Carreau wine, one of five fifth-generation family estates, is balanced between the dry core of tannins and the ripe black fruit. With acidity and a fine structure, it has great potential. As it develops the wine will show richness as well as concentration. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine is dry, rich and a perfect representation of a modern Napa Cabernet. Shows intricate layers of black cherries, black and red currants, cassis and minerals, with the funky layer of bacon and olives that the winery's other 2010 Cabs display. Way too young to drink now. Should begin to open after 2018 and hold its own for another decade.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"More toast than fruit even at this young stage, this is a ripe wine, showing big woody, toasty flavors that leave freshness behind. There are flavors of cream, caramel and wood here. Acidity appears on the finish.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"This crisp, tangy and refreshing wine has lemon and green-apple aromas, bright citrus flavors, medium body and a lean texture, due mostly to the generous acidity. Raw oysters on the half shell, garlic shrimp and goat-cheese toasts come to mind as good pairings.",US-California-Viognier
"A lovely Pinot Noir, delicious and sweet in fruit. You'll find a glyceriney fatness to it, courtesy of high alcohol, as well as sweet, smoky oak. The underlying flavors are wonderfully ripe in raspberries and cherries, and are brightened with fine acidity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This Chard has lots going for it, crisp acidity balanced with intense flavors of tropical fruits, orange, buttercream and baking spices. It's easy to drink now with classic California fare like Dungeness crab and buttered sourdough bread.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Labeled both as Orange and Rosé, this is Pinot Gris fermented on the skins, then aged in neutral oak for several months. A pretty sunset color, slightly oxidized, and aromatic with dried apricot and pear fruit, it's a wine for those with more-than-average curiosity. Highlights of dark chocolate and coffee creep in to a lingering finish.",US-Oregon-Rosé
"The partly volcanic nature of amphibolite soil gives this wine a natural ripe fruitiness. Apple skin and fresh Rocha pears convey a fruit-forward character, bright and crisp. It's a young wine, although it can be drunk now for its exuberant outward-looking character.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"This vintage has the Horiuchi artist label. Another glorious wine from the 2007 vintage, full and forward, packed with plum and purple fruits. Sweet tobacco and baking spices lead into a lush, fruit-loaded core, ripe with berries and plums. The finish—thick and textural and darkly chocolaty—wraps around polished, elegant tannins.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This is quite a change from the winery's previous vintage, with the alcohol reaching a hefty 15% and the new oak aging now at 50% new for 21 months. The result is astringent and earthy, a little sweaty and leathery, with drying tannins.",US-Washington-Malbec
"Loamy berry aromas smell a bit like wet clay and earth. This is fairly well structured, with grippy tannins. Baked, savory, oaky berry flavors finish with wood spice, clove and light herbal notes.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Simple, fruity and clean, with hints of toasted grain framing melon, fig and citrus flavors. Finishes on an anise note.",Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"This cool-vintage wine offers aromas of vanilla, coconut, barrel spice, clove and red fruit. The palate is full of restrained cranberry flavors that show persistence.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Fresh citrus and tangy orange give this perfumed wine both fruitiness and a tight, mineral texture. It has enough structure to age; drink from 2018. This bottling is a blend of second-level white grapes from two Domaine Dillon properties: Château Haut-Brion and Château La Mission Haut-Brion, both in Pessac-Léognan.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"The bouquet here is confounding. It has some green vegetable and cat-pee qualities as well as white stone fruits, sulfur and popcorn. In a word, it's complicated. In the mouth, grapefrut and celery flavors mingle with green grapes, while on the back end it's chalky and rather tart. The overall acidity is high, and there's one important thing missing here: balance.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine is dark and structured, offering ripe fruits although they are covered at this stage by the tannins. Firm and dense, with a dry core, this will be a powerful wine full of black fruits and concentration. Drink this from 2023.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This opens with pretty aromas of violets, plum cake and black berries. The juicy, smooth palate delivers crushed black cherry alongside supple tannins and bright acidity.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Aged for a year on its lees, this wine is rich, tangy and refreshingly crisp. It is a Blanc de Blancs, with a strongly mineral character that adds a tight character to the texture. It will age a few more months in bottle, so drink from late 2016.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Delicious, with pleasurable flavors of milk chocolate, cherries and dried red currants, as well as the sweet toast of oak. The tannins are wonderfully pure and complex, in the Napa style.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Doesn't say so on the label, but it's Cabernet Sauvignon. However it's utterly unlike most other Napa Cabs in the dryness and tartness. Almost like a Chianti, with bone-dry cherry, red currant and tobacco flavors, scoured with tannins, that finish with a cut of acidity.",US-California-Red Blend
"Melon, pear and apple aromas are standard and sweet. The palate is soft, maybe a bit mushy, with banana, pear and tropical fruit flavors. Finishes easy and flat, with lasting tropical sweetness.",Chile-Central Valley-Chardonnay
"Made in a dry, austerely tannic style, this Pinot Noir is very elegantly constructed, with notable acidity. It's dense and young, but very concentrated in black cherry jam, cola, beef jerky, olive tapenade, sandalwood and spice flavors. Needs time to resolve. Better after 2011.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Almost as pale in color as a rosé, this Pinot has a light, silky mouthfeel. It's forward and pleasant in raspberry and cherry flavors, kissed with a bit of oak. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Notes of earth mix with notes of leafy apple on the nose, the dry, fresh palate continues in that earthy vein and finishes dry with a bruised apple flavor.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Ripe, concentrated aromas of berry fruits and raisin announce a chunky but good palate. Oaky flavors are matched by tangy red-fruit notes and heavier back-palate prune, while the finish is thick and chewy, with just enough acidity to keep things in shape.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"The aromas start out quite locked up, with notes of purple fruit and flowers. The palate reveals fresh, quite pure aromas, with well-balanced acid and tannins and a finish that lingers.",US-Washington-Petite Sirah
"Made from a blend of 60% Alicante, 30% Nocera and 10% Calabrese, this wine has aromas of violet, tilled earth, mature plum, prune and black cooking spice. The soft, savory palate delivers ripe black cherry and black berry, accented by black pepper and nutmeg. It's balanced, with velvety tannins and fresh acidity. Made for early drinking pleasure, so enjoy soon.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"This clean, mild quaffer offers basic white-fruit aromas and a light-bodied, fresh palate. Apple and mild citrus flavors are short on the finish, which takes on an apricot flavor as it fades away.",Argentina-Other-Chardonnay
"This generous, fruity and lightly sweet wine should please a crowd with its butter and vanilla aromas, rich apple, pear and baking-spice flavors and rounded mouth-filling texture.",US-California-Chardonnay
"From the estate Main Ranch and given 10 months in French oak, less than half of it new, this has a high-acidity backbone that lifts and balances out the wine's richer tendencies. Lemon crème brûlée provides the weight and intensity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Aromas of white spring flower and apple delicately lead the nose on this refreshing white. The apple note follows through to svelte, polished palate along with pear and mineral. Crisp acidity gives it a clean, invigorating finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Bianco
"This Bordeaux blend has a surprisingly broad aspect, with very young fruit that opens up and then sits on the midpalate. It's much more open and expressive than the last few vintages. At first it seems dumbed down on the finish, but it slowly opens, and retasted on the second day it has filled out with muscle and verve.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A closed nose opens into the taut but streamlined body of this wine. There is tension on the slender but concentrated palate and a fearlessly brisk freshness, leading to a dry finish. The wine will benefit from bottle age and reward patience with glorious apple fruit. Drink 2018–2028.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Grapes are sourced from St. Helena and Oakville for this light-bodied, tart and slightly herbal wine, blended with 8% Sémillon. Ripe and round, it's both floral and fruity, highlighted by melon and pear.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine seems thin and rather tight. It has as much acidity as it does fruit, and a dry tannic structure. Not a wine for aging.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Hard spice, blackberry and leather form a firm opening salvo, then oak, mocha and chocolate notes take over on the bouquet. The palate is firm and healthy, with minerally berry, spice, leather and chocolaty flavors. Long, alert, pure and driving on the finish. Drink now through 2016.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"This wine is a blend of Syrah (76%), Grenache (21%) and Viognier (3%). Perfumed aromas of orange peel, flowers, spice and dark fruit lead to plump raspberry and smoked meat flavors. It needs time to unwind.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Dry, sizable tannins embrace a core of dusty black plum and blackberry. Straightforward and not overly ambitions, it finishes with a pronounced taste of oak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Like all of Alta Vista's single-vineyard Malbecs, this is opaque in color and ripe on the nose. Aromas of balsamic-coated raisin, black cherry and chocolate scream ripe and rich. On the palate, this is saturated, with grabby tannins. Toasty blackened flavors of blackberry and pepper narrow down on a tight tannic finish. Drink through 2024.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This Provençal-style blush is made from Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache. It's a good wine, dry and crisply acidic, but not without its faults. The main problem is a streak of green mint and vegetables. But there's enough sweet raspberry and cherry fruit to get by.",US-California-Rosé
"Aromas of smoke, sawdust and herbs are followed by lighter-styled cherry and cranberry flavors with spice accents.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Sweet-leaning aromas of apple, nectarine and mandarin orange are cut by a wet-cement aroma on the nose of this bottling. It's light and easy in style on the palate, with lime rind and chalk flavors. It's altogether quite mellow but very refreshing and quaffable.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
This easygoing sparkler has aromas of honeysuckle and apple that carry on to the off-dry palate along with mature yellow peach and candied lemon drop. It's simple but well made.,Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Wonderfully aromatic fruit rises from the glass: blueberry with cinnamon and violet overtones, hints of plum and pepper and a pervasive elderberry note. This is a wonderfully elegant medium-bodied wine with a distinct but unobtrusive structure that lets the fruit speak clearly and honestly. Fresh and elegant now, it's sure to develop and evolve. Drink now–2025.",Austria-Burgenland-Blaufränkisch
"This wine is tight, crisp with citrus flavors and intense acidity. It is developing into a refreshing, broader wine that will convey a riper character. Just wait until late 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Sweet, smoky oak and ultraripe flavors of tropical fruits mark this Chardonnay. It's strong and obvious in its appeal, but bright acidity and a stony minerality ground it, and the finish is thoroughly dry.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A floral, heavy style of blended white made from Macabeo, Gewürztraminer and Chardonnay. It has an exotic streak to the aromas along with smoked ham, fennel seed and gardenia. The palate is thick and tastes of papaya, salami and baked apple. It's a hodgepodge of abnormal aromas and flavors, but all totaled it works pretty well.",Spain-Northern Spain-White Blend
"Well composed with a steely palate of green apple and lemon complemented by apple blossom aromas, this is a medium-bodied white that's easygoing and not overly complex.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Zinfandel (46%) takes the lead on this blend, with the rest Sangiovese, Blaufrankisch and Malbec. Aromas of jammy red fruit and herb lead to ripe, expressive fruit flavors. It brings a lot of appeal and has a lovely sense of balance.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Dense all the way, from the dark, almost black color, to the huge aromas of blackberry jam, smoke and cassis, to the enormously fruity flavors. The texture is massive. This dry, complex wine coats the palate with all sorts of sensations, and the lush, sweet, fruity flavor lasts a full 30 seconds on the finish.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a firmly structured, dark wine. It has black cherry and berry fruit, a solid core of tannins and tight acidity. With its dense character, there is every chance of this impressive wine aging well, yielding a more rounded wine. Drink from 2016.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Showing tightly crisp grapefruit and citrus flavors, with an intense dryness and acidity, this is classic Muscadet, fresh, very bright and green.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"This medium-bodied wine is a great value and strikes a good balance between pure fruitiness and more complexity. It has friendly cherry and berry aromas and fairly rich flavors. A smooth, lightly tannic texture adds the right bite.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lightly vegetal aromas suggest asparagus. This feels round and chunky but not lazy or flabby. Flavors of citrus and citrus peel include bitter notes, while this tastes outright pithy on the finish. Drink now.",Chile-Central Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"There's exotic spice here that plays a supporting role to prune, plum and mature blackberry. The wine (a blend of Montepulciano and Nero di Troia) is simple, but generous and intense at the same time. It feels smooth and succulent in the mouth. Pair it with grilled steak and French fries.",Italy-Southern Italy-Red Blend
"Made from old vines, this complex and structured wine brings out the richness and ripe tannins of 2010. It's firm although the fruit concentration is what shows most strongly. It's an impressive, juicy, red-fruited wine that will age. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Long a strong suit at Snoqualmie, this new vintage does not disappoint. It's light and lively, with dusky flavors of plum and sweet tomato. Highlights of chocolate and cinnamon are delicately in focus, and it's hard to find a better price for such a nice Syrah in Washington.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Full, ripe black-fruit aromas open this fine Casablanca Syrah. In the mouth, this is juicy and fresh, with good body weight. Black plum, blackberry, barrel spice and herbal flavors finish long, subtle and lightly herbal. Drink through 2019.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Syrah
"Lots of acidity in this still-young Cabernet, giving the blackberry and cassis flavors a real bite that accentuates the tannins. It's tough now despite the richness, but doesn't have the stuffing for aging, so drink now with rich fare to balance the acids.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Soft and creamy, this gentle sparkling wine has some ripe apple fruits and attractive acidity. A yeasty aftertaste is less attractive.",France-France Other-Sparkling Blend
"From a fine vineyard site, this wine impresses in voluptuous texture and its lovely layers of lemon and apple. Floral on the nose in apple blossom and jasmine, it offers a slight twist of more spiced citrus, like an orange dotted in clove. It spent nine months in French oak, 40% of it new, which adds complexity and notes of toasted oak.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Buoyantly aromatic with notes of fresh wildflowers, preserved apricots and honey, this dry Riesling made from a tiny single-vineyard crop balances elegant crushed stone and stonefruit flavors with a focused acidity and stark orange peel astringency. Balanced and elegantly structured, it finishes on a long, meandering orange inflected note.",US-New York-Riesling
"The wood that dominated during the futures tastings in 2008 has calmed down, merging more easily into the rich fruits. There is an attractive smoky character, focused berry flavors and delicious spice. It should age well over 3–5 years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is roasted and meaty smelling. What the nose holds back is revealed on the palate, which is rugged, aggressive and tight as nails, with boisterous plum, berry, menthol and chocolate flavors. Coconut and chocolate-mint flavors come up on the power-packed finish.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley-Red Blend
"From the classic sand and flint soil that makes up much of the Sancerre vineyard, this complex wine has both fruit and intense minerality. The touches of toast and almonds round out the still young wine, contrasting with the more steely core. Drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc

"The blend of 55% Grenache, 25% Syrah, 16% Mourvèdre and 4% Cinsaut offers subtle mulberry fruit on the nose, a spicy peppercorn kick and plenty of gamy meats. That funky meat quality, from raw to jerkied, is prominent and pure on the sip, surrounded by exotic plums and Middle Eastern spices.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend

"The alcohol has dropped to just above 12% in this vintage, and the wine seems a tad underripe. Overtly grassy and pungent, it suggests with petrol, gooseberry and green banana. Drink it well-chilled.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"Neil Collins goes for the classic five Rhône grapes in this bottling, blending 48% Mourvèdre, 21% Syrah, 11% Grenache, 11% Cinsault and 9% Counoise to elicit aromas of dried fennel, fresh lavender, white pepper and boysenberry jam. Tight but juicy blueberry and elderberry fruit show on the palate, bound together by upright tannins and lifted with asphalt, black peppercorns and potpourri spice.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"A vital, focused Cabernet, this shows the sheer classiness of Oakville in its concentrated blackberry and black currant fruit. It's seemingly sweet and dry at the same time, and the tannins, which are extraordinarily thick, are fine and pure. Irresistably delicious now, this changes in the glass by the second. It suggests it wants some time in the cellar, so drink now–2021.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Broad, bold and buttery, with aromas of toasted white peach, flower blossom, vanilla and mild oxidation. The blend is 65% Viura with Malvasia and white Garnacha, and overall it's a round, stout, creamy wine with apple, vanilla and toasty, resiny flavors and finishing notes. A little heavy and sticky but nice for barrel-aged white Rioja.",Spain-Northern Spain-White Blend
"Made from selected parcels, this wine is structured and firm while not losing sight of rich red berry and cherry flavors. It's a dense wine, the tannins still developing and filling out to balance the fruits. Drink from 2017.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"The honeyed aroma of this Rhône blend of Marsanne, Roussanne, Rolle and Viognier makes it immediately attractive, but then the flavors kick in, and it turns into a roller coaster ride. Apricot jam, peaches, pears, pineapples, butter-sautéed plaintain, vanilla custard, star anise, lemon crème brûlée, the list goes on and on. The finish is fully dry and the alcohol is refreshingly low. Drink now.",US-California-Rhône-style White Blend
"Made in a deliberately trim and delicate style from Rhône grape varieties, this wine has a pleasant light pink-peach color and canteloupe aromas that lead to a crisp palate of light body and fresh, tart lemon and cranberry flavors.",US-California-Rosé
"This Pinot is crisp and delicately structured, with a silky texture. But the cola, raspberry and red currant flavors are thin, leading to a fast finish. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Gritty aromas of road tar share space on the nose with black cherry and dark plum scents. This feels hard and abrasive, even by Ribera del Duero standards. Plum, berry and integrated oak flavors finish savory and with a lasting note of dry oak. Drink through 2023.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This is a light and simply fruity wine, showing lively acidity and black currant fruit tones. It is soft on the palate and only lightly disturbed by a dry tannic background. Drink now.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
"Artadi's top wine is dynamite in a bottle. Ripe, saturated, oaky aromas of blackberry, leather, blueberry pie and aged cheese are incredibly potent and alluring. This is huge in the mouth, with lemony oak and broad tannins that don't grind. Intense blackberry, coffee, toast and smoky flavors finish a mile deep, with all sorts of textural grab and character. Best from 2016 through 2026.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Rich vanilla notes of fine oak drape around dark fruit and iron oxide on the nose. The palate delivers the juicy fullness of crushed blackberry and bramble, along with the characteristic white pepper notes of Blaufränkisch. The fruit is aromatic and also has a cinnamon-tinged blueberry note. The body is smooth and flows with very soft tannins and immense freshness.",Austria-Leithaberg-Blaufränkisch
"Quite staunch and almost sour smelling, with an initial blast of vinegar that later settles on herbal. Flavors of baked beans and herbal fruit carry heat and scouring acidity. Rubbery as well.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Carmenère
"This wine from a cool corner of the Sierra Foothills has lots of varietal character, from a rather deep straw color to waxy, nutty aromas to mild walnut and pear flavors to a rich, viscous texture. It is appetizing and substantial enough for a bold seafood dish.",US-California-Sémillon
"Aroma of red berry, orange peel and a whiff of rose eventually emerge on this easygoing red. The informal palate offers red cherry, raspberry and clove alongside zesty acidity.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"A glamorous wine, rich and complex, with lots going on. Lacks perhaps some of the depth of, say, the '03 and '04, more on a par with the 2007, but still a very fine Insignia. With rich blackberry and cassis flavors wrapped into thick tannins and fine new oak sweetness, it's nowhere ready to drink now. Give it a rest until 2015.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Dusty apple and canned pear aromas lead to a chunky, fruity palate that tastes more briny and salty than ideal. There are leesy notes to the finish, but it's saltiness that creates the final impression.",Spain-Northern Spain-Chardonnay
"This simple, slightly sweet Pinot Grigio has some veggie-like underripeness, but offers enough orange and peach fruit to satisfy.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"Fruity aromas of wild berry meld together with whiffs of violet, tilled earth and dark spice on this young juicy red. The round savory palate doles out ripe black cherry, black berry, white pepper and a hint of licorice alongside supple tannins.

Six months in oak barrels have given the nose of this wine a lovely overlay of mocha and coffee on top of the cherry fruit. Raspberry flavors dominate the mouth while vanilla and strawberry linger on the finish.

"Unlike many '05 Rhônes, this is made in a soft, silky, approachable style, marrying brandied cherries with cinnamon and clove and supple tannins. Shows a touch of warmth on the finish. Drink now-2018.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend

Full bodied, it nonetheless features crisp, balanced acidity and a taste of rosemary and lavender, the perfect companion to a butterflied lamb seasoned the same.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This plump, medium-bodied Chardonnay boasts aromas and flavors of smoke and grilled pineapple. It may be a little on the simple side, but it's well done, combining ample varietal character with an appetizing bit of oak.",Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"Forest floor, tilled earth, truffle, ripe berry, thyme and a whiff of game are some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied red.

"This stylish, tightly wound, concentrated effort features yellow fruits adorned with layers of toast, butter and caramel.

But if you have the patience to decant/aerate properly, it is immensely enjoyable right now, and a very fine value.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"La Roncaia's Picolit exhibits a very distinctive style. The wine is thick and dark amber in color and has rich, almost brooding notes of toast, pine resin, molasses and burnt caramel. It's definitely on the extracted, syrupy side and might pair better with Roquefort or aged cheese than it would with dessert.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Picolit
"A particularly fresh and refreshing wine, with the cleanest acidity, attractive red fruits and grapefruit juice. A great apéritif style. Screwcap.",France-Provence-Rosé

This third-generation family estate hosts monthly musical and tasting events with estate fruit, vegetables and honey for sale.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Drier and more minerally than Foxen's other Chardonnays, because it is the least oaked. It's vibrant in grilled pineapple, mango, apricot and vanilla spice flavors, brightened by beautiful acidity. Alcohol is quite high, but the wine never tastes hot or unbalanced.",US-California-Chardonnay

It has layers of fruit, a bit of smoke, and lots of fine tannins that pile up for a rich mouthfeel and lingering finish.",US-California-Red Blend
"A two-acre parcel of 75-year-old vines is the source of this jewel of a wine. It is ripe, full bodied and packed with dark fruits. The tannins and the structure promise some aging.

"This wine by Gypsy Canyon's Deborah Hall raises money for dogs in Thailand, but it's certainly no gimmick.

"Defines the old style of Carneros Pinot, with juicy flavors of raspberries and cherries and the silkiest, smoothest tannins you ever had.

"I think by “lust” they mean something like a decadent chocolate truffle with a gooey cherry liqueur filling. That's what this sweetish wine, which has 15.9% alcohol, tastes like.

"90-92. Barrel sample. Dense and concentrated, this is a massive wine that's packed with tannins.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is pretty good Zin, fully ripened and showing classic wild berry and spice notes, although there’s an earthy, cardboardy aroma that’s a little off-putting.

This is open and and very joyous, fresh and utterly fruit-driven with a lasting, very moreish finish.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Dark, dense and very modern in style, with captivating aromas and obvious richness. At 14.5%, this is big, New World Pinot Noir. But its flavors of black cherry, raspberry and cola nut are elevated and brush up against world class. With a cool finish, steady acidity and tannins, and fine purity, Alazan ranks as one of South America's few top-tier Pinot Noirs.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir
"As characterful as the dry version but with lower alcohol and a slight hint of sweetness, this boasts powerful tangerine, quince and Meyer lemon fruit. Its electric acidity keeps it vivid and beautifully balanced. Delicious now, it's also cellar-worthy.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"A blend of 60% Primitivo and 40% Negroamaro, this features aromas of spicy plum, ripe berry, vanilla and a balsamic note. The firm palate offers blackberry, black cherry, espresso and licorice alongside assertive tannins that leave an astringent finish.",Italy-Southern Italy-Red Blend
"Gently perfumed hints of ripe pear almost seem to have a floral dimension. On the palate the mellow, generous and totally ripe pear fruit unfolds fully and gives glimpses of very juicy ripe, dried and baked fruit. All of this richness is countered by lemony freshness. There is an earthy textural element, and more shimmering fruit reminiscent of bottled mirabelle plums. This is generous and just off dry, with a concentrated, convincing and very moreish balanced richness.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"This is aged in barrel, but the power of the source's granitic soils is such that the oak is barely noticeable. Nasturtium blossom and apricot mark the nose, while the palate adds pineapple, cinnamon and clove. The wine is a bit oily in texture, but with a long, tropical-fruit-laced finish that brings admirable freshness, focus and energy.",France-Rhône Valley-Viognier
"Refreshing, varietally pure and crisp. That's the Bonterra style, and this Roussanne is right there. With partial barrel fermentation, it has smoky butter and vanilla notes that frame immaculate pineapple, pear, candied ginger and tangerine flavors. Enjoy this delicious, full-bodied white wine as an alternative to Chardonnay.",US-California-Roussanne
"A 50/50 blend of wood-aged Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon from selected wines. It is wood-dominated at present, but the fruit feels rich enough to come through shortly, and then it will be an impressively ripe, structured wine. However, it's always going to be a dry, dark and firmly tannic.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This co-mingling holds 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Petit Verdot. Juicy blackberry and cassis make up the wine's fruit component, accompanied by solid structure and tannins, and an unusual sprinkling of coconut macaroon.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This deeply yellow-gold coloured wine opens with mature aromas of nut, flint and dried apricot. The lean palate is also already evolved, offering smoky mineral and yellow apple skin alongside firm acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Put this into the budget category (for Oregon Pinot Noir) where it shines. Fruity and forward, there's plenty to like in the mix of orange flesh and rind, and strawberry and cherry hard candy. The fruit is backed with ample tannin, and a warm touch of mocha and toast fills in the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"From a vineyard planted in 1981 in the hills above what became Silicon Valley, this shows soy sauce, sesame, black olive, dill, beef jerky and the darkest of black fruits on the nose. The palate continues the Asian flavor theme, with teriyaki, Chinese five spice and hoisin sauce as well as blueberry paste, dusty leather and crushed rocks, framed by strong structure and bright acidity. Drink 2017–2027.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"With 10% Syrah blended in, this wine offers high-toned notes of herb, kirsch, crushed flowers and cherry, bringing a wild element along with it. The black cherry flavors are pure and vivid, showing a sense of purity that captures the attention, with a lengthy finish that kicks it up a notch.",US-Washington-Mourvèdre
"After opening with reedy, stalky aromas, this is raw and choppy on the palate. Flavors of herbal red plum and rhubarb conclude with tight, edgy acids and a bit of burn and heat. This is fresh and generally pretty good, but it lacks Toro's usual richness and power.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro
"Red currant aromas are an immediately attractive start for this light, fruity wine. With its crisp acidity and bright red currant and raspberry fruit, it's lively and ready to drink.",France-France Other-Rosé
"This has aromas of ripe plum and new oak, with a hint of raisin. The palate delivers prune and black cherry notes, with a hint of cocoa. It's simply styled, but delicious.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Lovingston's medium-bodied Bordeaux Blend is pleasantly grapy on the nose with an undertone of darkly toasted oak, nuts and savory spices. The palate holds a decent amount of black fruit, but with a green, underripe vein and fairly high level of acidity and tannins.",US-Virginia-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"With five years bottle aging, this is a wine that shows great balance, along with a blossoming maturity. The wine is dry with brisk acidity, intense minerality and a taut profile, but rich and concentrated with apple flavor. It's likely to age for several more years.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"A little watery, but it still conveys tropical fruit, lemon, pineapple and buttered toast flavors. The texture is creamy, and there's a lively spine of acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A very fine Cabernet Sauvignon, dry and classically structured. It's a big, full-bodied wine, with hefty tannins that effectively lock down intense flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate and minerals. Complex and dramatic, this beauty is clearly a cellar candidate. Give it 6–8 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is 50% Syrah, 41% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot and 2% Malbec. The aromas pop, with notes of blackberry, blueberry, smoked meat and herb. The fruit flavors are lush, backed by tannins that bring quite a bit of grit to them. Perhaps some additional time in the bottle will soften them out.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Popping with aromas of lychee, rose, geranium and violet this wine is quite perfumed. There are also citrus notes of lime zest and lemon curd. Flavors are perfumed and soapy as well, and it wine coats your mouth. The finish is long with a slightly bitter end.",US-Virginia-White Blend
"This is a blend of several vineyards, including Pratt Vineyard Vine Hill and Gap's Crown. The wine captures the excellence of both sites in its minerality and fruit-forward nature. Rich, heady caramel and nutmeg mark the nose as the palate comes into balance, part tropical vanilla, part briny sea salt.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A fruity, juicy wine with balanced tannins and red fruits. It is a lively perfumed wine that has some toasty tannins in the background. Drink this ripe wine from 2019. One of five wineries owned by Bernadette Faure and Alain Aubert; their daughters oversee vineyards, winemaking and marketing.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"A big, woody, totally modern style of Syrah. There is a lot more coconut, mocha and big berry fruit than anything you might find from France. It's dark and layered on the palate, with coconut and resin supporting black fruit. Finishes smoky and oaky, but structured, tannic and serious enough to impress.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Syrah
"A soft and layered expression of dense black cherry, chocolate and spicy tobacco, this is easy to enjoy and approachable, rich and round. A taste of black licorice dots the finishing moments.",US-California-Malbec
"Aromas of white flower, hazelnut and orchard fruit follow over to the savory palate along with mature pear, lime zest and smoke. A mineral note signals the finish.",Italy-Southern Italy-Fiano
"Typically the most forward of the winery's offerings, this wine brings aromas of blue fruit along with notes of fire pit, olive, mineral and cured meat that become more prominent over time. The blue and black-fruit flavors are dense and focused, with a firm backbone of tannins providing support. It needs time in the cellar to stretch its legs.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Named for the documentary filmmaker, artist and wife of Francis Ford Coppola, Eleanor blends Syrah and Petite Sirah from Rutherford with Cabernet Sauvignon from Alexander Valley and Syrah from Dry Creek Valley to form a rich, red, extracted wine generously succulent in cranberry and dark cherry.

"This wine is from Alain Dominique Perrin's Lagrézette estate in Cahors, although it is not labeled as such because the Cahors AOP is only red wine. Made from Malbec, it has the palest rosé color and elegant texture, with strawberry fruitiness and lively final acidity. Drink now.",France-Southwest France-Rosé

"This wine comes from a vineyard planted in the early 2000s in the Sebastopol Hills by Charlie Chenoweth for the Jenkins family, a country music trio consisting of Nancy Jenkins and her two daughters.

"Fans of New Zealand's SBs will like this wine's racy nose, which is packed with minerals, some stoniness, melon, and a hint of grassiness. Citrus is in full force in the mouth, aided by a touch of green herbs and a white-pepper spice. The finish is elegant and offers hints of grapefruit. It's a youthful, fresh wine; one that will go well with salads or fish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"The fermentation of this white Pinot, which eliminates skin contact (hence color), also removes any hint of varietal flavor. In other words, this tastes not at all like regular, red Pinot Noir. It's more along the lines of a stainless-steel-fermented Chardonnay, with that grape's simple neutrality first and foremost.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"Cut with sulfur, this is a wine whose bitterness hides the potential of the strawberry fruits and acidity. Off-dry, it's unbalanced.",France-Loire Valley-Rosé

"For a large-production sparkler made from an almost 50-50 split of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, a dollop of Pinot Meunier blended in, this is impressive, dry and refreshing in acidity.

"A true labor of love, this fabulous Vin Santo opens with beautiful intensity and infinite aromas of roasted chestnut, maple syrup, caramel, butterscotch and candied orange.

This is what Italians call a meditation wine that can easily be consumed alone after dinner.",Italy-Tuscany-White Blend
"Neither McLaren Vale nor Adelaide Hills are particularly known for their Rieslings, but this is a fine example. Scents of wet stone and flower-shop greens lead into off-dry flavors of lemon zest and green apples. The balance between sugar and acids, lithe body and long finish is finely judged. Drink now–2025.",Australia-South Australia-Riesling
"The nose of this wine is bursting with raspberry, cranberry jam, violets and geranium. These notes carry to the palate, effortlessly melding together with a faint hint of tar. Soft cedar and nutmeg from 18 months in French oak offer compexity and a full structure. A smooth texture and well-integrated tannins make for a long and complex finish.",US-Virginia-Meritage
"Even with the elder Giuseppe Quintarelli in retirement, this storied name in Valpolicella continues to make one of the most classic and traditional expressions of Amarone available today.

"This wine was half barrel-fermented, with just 25% of it new and French oak. It benefits from this treatment, offering fruit that leans toward Meyer lemon, melon and a vaguely tropical vibe, remaining balanced throughout, but especially on the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Aromas recall underbrush, truffle, violet, tobacco leaf and black berry. The palate offers up red cherry, white pepper, clove, licorice and espresso alongside angular and drying tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This is the winery's reserve, made just twice previously, in 2010 and 2012. Production is up sharply, and it's a ripe, round fruit pie of a wine, best enjoyed while still young. Red fruits and citrus are in the mix, with a touch of papaya. It was aged 14 months in French oak, two-thirds of it new.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of menthol, underbrush, scorched soil, licorice and ripe plum lead the nose. The structured palate delivers dried black cherry, aniseed, eucalyptus and ground pepper alongside a backbone of fine-grained tannins. It closes on a coffee note.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese

"Babcock's Grand Cuvée hasn't changed its style over the years. It remains dense and sappy in youth, showing extracted cherry, raspberry and cassis fruit, with complex notes of bacon, leather and spice. Not particularly subtle now, it should gain elegance in a few years. Best late 2008 through 2012.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"From a 3.5-acre block planted in 1978, which makes it Santa Barbara County's first Syrah, this bottling shows an intriguing density of flowers on the nose along with a funky compost note, elderberry fruit, pine needles and fresh mint. Cracked peppercorn, dried thyme and rosemary combine for strong herbal intrigue on the palate, spicing up the black plum and blackberry fruit.",US-California-Syrah
"Cool herbal aromas of blackberry and cola are minty. This feels narrow, with hard tannins that aren't ready to reconcile now. Herbal salty flavors of meaty berry fruits are warm, spicy and steadfast with herbal notes through the finish. Drink through 2020.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Ripe and rich, this offers layers of yellow fruits over a crisper, more steely texture. From one of the largest vineyards in Montagny, this concentrated wine needs time to develop. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"Very full-bodied and rich, a densely structured wine that's too young to appreciate now. The cherries, raspberries, currants, roasted coconut, mocha frappuccino, date nut bread, candied ginger, orange tea and sandalwood are exotic and almost overpowering, but the wine never loses its tense control. Now through 2012, at least.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"McManis excels at making good wines at competitive prices and this is a prime example. It's smooth, easy-drinking Pinot Noir, with cherry-vanilla layers from start to finish. Pair with roast chicken, turkey meat loaf or simple burgers; a nice quaff at a nice price.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Maturing well, this wine shows 2005's combination of richness and structure. It is built around firm, dusty tannins and big black-currant flavors, with a fine perfumed character from the wood aging.

"Tenuta di Sesta is run by a perfect father-mother-daughter-son team and is located in one of the least-traveled corners of Montalcino. The 2007 Brunello delivers sweet oak tones that drive the initial bouquet and are soon followed by bright cherry, vanilla bean, sweet mocha and rum cake. Pretty balsam notes at the back will undoubtedly increase and evolve with age. Cellar this wine 10 years.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"This bargain-priced wine is oaky and bland, with a smell of menthol.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This full-bodied, 100% Cabernet is lightly gamy, offering a sensuous potpourri of wild herbs and brambly berries.

"There are strong elements of the wood aging in this structured wine. That gives it a dry character that still dominates the red fruits. It needs to develop. While it will always have a dry character, look for the fruit to shine with its berry flavors and acidity. Wait to drink until 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Very funky and confounding at first, but then it opens to reveal smoke, stone fruit and mineral aromas. The mouth is quite spicy, with green herbs accenting citrus and mineral.

"Zesty, full-bodied and expansive on the palate, this is a wine that comes around in time, in the glass and in the bottle or decanter.

Structured, it should cellar well, through 2020.",US-California-Chardonnay
"While the nose is demure, the palate on this dainty auslese bursts of sweet yellow peaches and cherries. Luscious and clingy, it's irresistibly juicy, yet remarkably mineral and structured, with a nervous tension throughout. It's delicious now, yet should gain even more mineral complexity from 2020 and on.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Yeasty aromas of banana and white bread feed into a round full palate that's not at all edgy despite this being brut nature. Bready, yeasty flavors of citrus and nectarine end with a flash of peach and excellent clarity, length and elegance. Both this and AA's Privat Mirgin prove that elevated Cava can compete with the world's best sparkling wines.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon each make up 45% of this wine, with the balance Malbec. It comes off as quite green, with notes of bell pepper and green herb, along with unusual mesquite flavors. The alcohol pokes through on both the aromas and palate.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of baked dark-skinned fruit, cedar, cooking spice and a balsamic note unfold in the glass. A blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Sangiovese, and 5% Cabernet Franc, the firmly structured palate delivers ripe black currants, dried black cherries, clove, mint, tobacco and anise alongside tightly woven but fine-grained tannins. Give this time to unwind and fully develop. Drink 2017–2023.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"This is the small-production, flagship wine from the Sierra region's best producer of Rhône-style wines. Lovely, spicy, floral aromas and generous, complex and layered flavors make the wine irresistible, while its strong but velvety texture sets it up for a long life in the cellar for those who can resist. It smells lightly oaky, like a cigar box and cocoa, tastes deep and focused on blackberry, pomegranate and dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is both rich and a bit reserved. Best to drink from 2020 to 2030.",US-California-Syrah

"There's a richness to this wine that's immensely pleasurable, but also a meaty, umami spiciness. It's actually remniscent of chocolate-covered bacon, infused with blackberry essence and liquid licorice, then sprinkled with black pepper. Really delicious, if a little hot in alcohol.",US-California-Petite Sirah

The balance is just right, the texture is snappy, appetizing and rich at the same time and the finish lingers. Best after 2016.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is warm and loose, with fruit that is very ripe and just on the verge of pruney. The ripe fruit flavors seem to soften the tannins, which are also quite ripe and smooth.

"Ironstone's aim with this Bordeaux blend seems clear, to produce an ageworthy wine of distinction. They have largely succeeded, although it's a very different style than you'll find from anything on the coast. It shows the briary, brambly tannins and tastes usually associated with Foothills Zinfandel, but the black currant and cherry flavors belong to Cabernet Sauvignon, which constitutes 80% of the blend. Will hold and improve through 2013.",US-California-Meritage

So good now, you can hardly keep your hands off the cork, but it should develop for many years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"A blend of equal parts Merlot and Petit Verdot, this offers aromas of underbrush, toast, baked plum, nutmeg and mocha.

This has reached its ideal drinking window so enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

With crisp acidity and a creamy texture, it's dry and minerally, with interestingly rich flavors of citrus fruits, melons and pears, and a touch of smoky oak.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"A faint perfume of pear can be caught on the otherwise dull nose. The flavors run toward candied pear, honeydew and peach.

Drink this fairly tannic red through 2024.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend

"This Zinfandel-based wine, which blends 13% Tempranillo and 6% Petite Sirah, shows strawberry, cherry, baking spice and cola aromas. There is decent tannic tension on the palate, and the flavors—sarsaparilla, cola, stewed plum and clove spice—are easily enjoyable.",US-California-Zinfandel

"Full, gorgeous and bright, this shows restraint and elegance, with lovely aromas of sweet cherry, blackberry pie, leather, tar and black licorice.

"Joseph Jewell's 2009 Elk Prairie is even better than its 2008, which is saying something. This vintage opens with perfumed cola spice and cinnamon that evolves in its lightly textured, lush mouthfeel into decadent strawberry in crème Anglaise. Bright, with a lingering finish, this Pinot Noir only gets better while in the glass.",US-California-Pinot Noir

A ripe red-fruit note offers a perfumed character to this fruity wine. A touch of banana is the only quibble with what is otherwise a bright selection.,France-Beaujolais-Gamay

"Named after the winery owners' kids Niki and Kiara, this blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Malbec, 14% Petit Verdot, 12% Cabernet Franc and 4% Merlot offers roasted game and subtle blackberries on the nose. It's more complex on the palate, with smoked plums leading into licorice and coffee in the midpalate, finishing on nice and easy tannins.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"The herbal, thin fruit is covered with a strong streak of vanilla. It finishes with bitter tannins.",US-Washington-Merlot

"Mar de Palha (seaweed) is a reminder of the closeness of the ocean to the Chocapalha estate. This is a rich, wood-aged wine, full of dark plum and berry fruits with almost-sweet tannins. It's ready to drink in a rich, young fruit way, although it will be even better from 2016.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese Red

"Michael Mondavi's Folio Fine Wine Partners now offers an Oregon Pinot Noir, this one vinified by Rob Mondavi, a fourth- generation winemaker.

It's the sort of subtle, classic style that rewards both time and attention.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Leather, tobacco and light Bresaola open the nose of this dark, masculine Barolo. But wait a few minutes and the wine starts to deliver elegant tones of rose, violet, tar and polished granite stone.

"This is an extraordinarily rich Amarone that exudes blackness and dense aromas of cola, raisins, dried prunes, leather, tobacco, spice and cherry wood.

"From this rich vintage comes this delicious, open wine. Flavors of tropical fruit and peach create an opulent and generous feel, with notes from having aged in wood offering complexity. It's concentrated and ageworthy, worth keeping for 4–5 years and more.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Roasted meat, leather, animal and stout berry aromas make for an inviting bouquet.

"This wine is a blend of 59% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc, 4% Malbec, 2% Petit Verdot and 2% Syrah.

"Dark, full and very oaky on the nose, this extracted Malbec is ripe and toasty smelling.

"Rustic aromas of barnyard, game and overripe fruit follow through to the brawny palate along with powdered sage, violet and a hint of game. Full-bodied but lacking fruit richness, it and ends on a bitter note.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Taut, light and crisp, this Muscadet boasts fresh citrus flavor and apple-skin structure. There is a youthful, yeasty fell to the wine at this stage and it needs a few more months to settle together.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"Typically semi-sweet style of rosé, crisp and clean, flavored with ripe strawberries. Good as an apéritif or with spicy dishes. Screwcap.",France-Loire Valley-Rosé
Peach and honeysuckle aromas lead the way on this lively wine and carry over to the straightforward palate along with citrusy notes. It's simple but well made.,Italy-Veneto-Pinot Grigio

"Mild apple and white-fruit aromas are a bit wheaty like bread. Conversely, the palate is tight, with pulling lemony acidity. Like the nose, this tastes wheaty and like stone fruits, while the finish is distinctly leesy.",Spain-Northern Spain-Godello
"A wish of smoke adds complexity and mystery to bright tangerine, white peach and floral notes on this dry-style Riesling. It's delicate in body, but vibrantly structured, with tart lemon-lime acidity that pierces through ripe stone-fruit flavors on the palate.",US-New York-Riesling
"In this wine, a distinct and delicious blackberry-jam aroma is backed up by concentrated and pure fruit flavors. But the balance is good and dry, and the wine has a mouth-filling texture buoyed by fine-grained tannins and full body. This is a wonderful example of a flavor-packed but sophisticated dinner wine from this varietal.",US-California-Primitivo
"Lightness defines this wine, from its body to bouquet. Fresh-picked strawberry, cranberry and herb commingle nicely, but quite shyly, the fruit forwardness subtle and the structure refined. Spikes of mushroom and tea peak throughout.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Freshly scented of apple and yellow peaches, this fairly dry Riesling gains softness from a sweet white grapefruit juice note. Brisk with a lemon pith astringency and notes of slate and chalk that linger through a clean, minerally finish.",US-New York-Riesling
"The blend is 70% Pinot Gris and 30% Viognier. The Gris provides the fruit base, with pear/apple flavors; the Viognier adds some light lemon and citrus blossom accents. This is a big wine, bone dry.",US-Washington-White Blend
"Too sharp in acids, giving the cherry and raspberry flavors a real bite. Almost sour on the finish. Drink now.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Aromas of citrus blossom, white stone fruit and sage lead the nose on this bright, frothy dessert wine. The rich palate doles out lemon, tangerine zest and apricot offset by fresh acidity and a soft mousse.",Italy-Piedmont-Moscato
"This wine has simple fruit with fresh acidity, touches of lemon and a crisp, tangy texture. Still young, it offers a flinty edge and a steely aftertaste, both of which will merge into the apple and grapefruit flavors over the next few months. Drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This fresh wine also offers plenty of ripe fruit and exotic flavors. Crisp, juicy and rich, it's just lightly touched by honey and is a refreshing wine to drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A very spicy Gewurztraminer that is soft, lychee flavored and full-bodied. It is all perfume, only just hinting at acidity, off dry in style, very ready to drink now.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Although the producer is based in the Loire, it sources grapes for this wine from other regions of France as well as locally. That gives the wine perhaps a richer, softer, less fresh character. It is an easy, apple-fruity wine with light acidity.",France-France Other-Sparkling Blend
"This is a very sweet wine, with aromas like cotton candy and marshmallows, flavors like extra-sweet lemonade, and a syrupy texture.",US-California-Muscat Canelli
"A blend with mainly Rolle and some Clairette, this is light, bright and crisp. Floral aromas lead to sliced apple and lime juice flavors that offer lively acidity and a tangy, zesty aftertaste. The wine is ready to drink.",France-Provence-Provence white blend
"This longtime winery recently released new labels, and this bottling is one of the first releases to wear the slicker style. Lavish aromas of blueberry, black currant and caramel lead into a palate full of soft chalky tannins that carry flavors of tangy plum skin, bacon fat and crème de cassis. This will age very well, but is tasty now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Stocky yet comported up front, this dark-colored Carmenère pumps out blackberry aromas along with notes of dried herbs and desert brush. A full but balanced palate deals toasty, blackened plum and spice flavors in front of a finish with ample oak and baking-spice notes.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"This is a Pinot Noir-based blend, and it's quite a good dry, red wine of some sophistication and elegance. Soft and approachable, its cherry fruit flavors are complexed with herbs, such as sage and thyme, and a rich earthiness.",US-California-Red Blend
"The power and structure of a Corton-Charlemagne are very evident in this firm and closed wine. At this young stage, it is all about the concentrated texture and weight. The acidity and the rich fruits will come later. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A touch of ripe pear plays into the Golden Delicious notes of the nose. The palate displays the same fruit flavors on its very light and easy fruit-driven palate, supported by freshness and fizzing froth. The lemony finish is dry and refreshing.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"This is soft, round and beautifully ripe with just a touch of perfume. A rich wine that is only lightly structured, juicy and forward.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"The plummy, cherry-like fruit of St. Laurent and its soft, pliable, smooth nature are well captured here. This is a very juicy, easy-drinking rendition that would also work chilled. Drink soon.",Austria-Burgenland-St. Laurent
"Estate-grown, though it is not indicated on the label, this matches black raspberries to a lightly toasty frame. The wine spent just under a year in French oak prior to bottling. The fruit and oak components are in good proportion, but another year or two in bottle will help to meld the flavors.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"In this well-made white, half of the wine was stainless-steel fermented, the other half barrel-fermented. Honeyed aromas of almond and a viscous, medium-bodied texture build weight toward the finish, while never becoming cloying. Vanilla and apricot round out the profile, buoyed by crisp acidity.",US-California-Viognier
"A very pleasant cherry-raspberry aroma and similarly fruity flavors bring a lot of appeal to this light-bodied and not very tannic wine. It's smooth and easy to drink, with no rough edges.",US-California-Red Blend
"Packed with wood and fruit tannins, it is a solid, dark and dense wine that will develop well. It shows great structure, concentrated berry fruits and final acidity. Wait until 2017 before drinking.",Portugal-Tejo-Touriga Nacional
"Benjamin Silver quietly makes great stuff out of a small warehouse on Santa Barbara's Eastside, including this Syrah that's boosted by pinches of Mourvèdre, Grenache and Viognier. Beautiful aromas of roasted pork in a blackberry-licorice reduction sauce pick up a bit of grape candy before hitting the palate with black pepper, blueberries and solid tannins. It's fun but serious.",US-California-Syrah
"This delicate wine exudes swathes of lemon chiffon and white flowers, offering similar experiences on the palate. Staying light in oak, it has texture and body to spare, without ever overpowering, making for a food-friendly, versatile wine.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Shows Petite Sirah's rustic, tannic nature, with a robust body housing flavors of berries, currants, carob powder, crisp bacon and sandalwood. With its sweet finish, it doesn't seem like a longterm ager, but will mellow over the next several years.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Firmly structured and loaded with energy, this intense red opens with aromas of new leather, pipe tobacco, eucalyptus and a whiff of cake spice.

"From four estate vineyards with an average vine age of 33 years, this sparkles in creamy texture and sophisticated, yummy flavors of tangerine, grapefruit and pear. Stony minerality plays on the palate throughout, buoying complex components of jasmine and a lingering, more concentrated finish of honey. With plenty of structure and stuffing, it'll only get better over time, through about 2018.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Robust, peppery, dry and fruity, just what an inexpensive Shiraz should be. Easy to like for its array of blackberries, spices and cedar. A great value in a barbecue-style wine.",US-California-Shiraz

"This nice drinking Chard offers plenty of bang for the buck. It's dry and creamy, with oak-infused pear, peach and green apple fruit flavors that finish in a swirl of dusty spices.",US-California-Chardonnay
Muscat gummy and herb aromas are followed by dry tropical fruit and ale flavors that are lightly styled. Drink now.,US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc

"Light pink in color, this wine offers aromas of strawberry, bubblegum, cherry and melon. It drinks off dry, with mouthwatering fruit flavors.",US-Washington-Pinot Gris
"Creamy and buttery with gorgeous notes of stone fruit, exotic fruit, vanilla, honey and a playful touch of banana, this wine is an exceptional companion to shellfish, clams or chowder. The aromas are direct, intense and very seductive. This is an opulent, sophisticated wine that wins high scores across the board, thanks to its genuine intensity and its crisp, flavor-rich finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend

"Almost white in color, this wine is fruity and crisp with lemon and lime flavors. A light hint of a tannic structure also suggests minerality. The aftertaste is bright and packed with acidity.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"Winemaker and owner Chris Pittenger dips into his Campbell Ranch and Baranoff vineyard sources to make this fresh, light style of deliciousness, spiky in acidity and earthy in dark cherry. Additional hits of citrus compel on the palate and nose, before fresh-cut roses take their cue.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This opens with aromas of blue flower, blackberry, crushed plum and a whiff of wet asphalt. The bold palate discloses black plum, prune, black pepper, coffee bean, and grilled herb alongside tightly-knit tannins. It finishes on a mocha note. Drink 2016–2023.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Jindalee's 2007 is a medium-bodied Shiraz with slightly candied fruit and a sensation of sweetness on the short, soft finish.",Australia-Australia Other-Shiraz
"Named for Bob Biale's father Aldo, who maintained head-trained, dry-farmed vines planted in 1937, this red is as mighty as the man, with a length of powerful acidity. Cherry, blueberry and vanilla play against dried flowers and smoked meat, with a tanginess of Asian spice.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Orange and mandarin flavors mark this warm, full-bodied wine. It's forward and fruity, showing a sweeter character, with vanilla and spice tones. Drink soon.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"This delivers about the same intensity and concentration as a top shelf Amarone—but for half the price. It offers loads of spice, ripe fruit, leather, tobacco and black olive flavors that drive the long, supple mouthfeel.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Yeasty, candied aromas rest in front of a foamy palate that lacks polish. This tastes like 7-Up and fresh grass, with sweet, yeasty, green-herb flavors that dissipate quickly on the finish.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Made for aging, this wine is structured and firm. It has a dense texture surrounded by ripe white and yellow fruits. With a touch of spice and a pepper character, it is rich, impressive and full-bodied. Drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"This prestige cuvée from Collet, with its hand-blown bottle and blend mainly of Premier and Grand Cru vineyards, is elegant and stylish—just like the fashion industry it celebrates. It is balanced, soft and ripe, filled with pear and apricot fruits that are cut with steely acidity. The wine has touches of maturity and this bottling is ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This is a beautifully balanced, elegant and mature sparkler. There is fruit—ripe strawberry—but the main character is its fine balance and richness. It can age, though it is at its best now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Here's a rustic Cabernet. With the right foods, at the right time, it's fine. By itself it's awkward, with some elements out of balance, but the cherry-berry notes will play well against a great burger.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A cool, crisp and fresh wine that also has enough weight to go well with food. It has lively lemon, plum and red apple flavors. A touch of steely character lends great shape to this ready to drink wine.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese White
"Soft, peach fruits abound in this simple and attractive wine. It's fragrant and fruity, with a light texture and fresh acidity at the end.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Just hinting at more mature flavors, this is an intense wine, its acidity almost overwhelming. Red currant, spice and concentrated juiciness are all elements in this dense wine. The acidity does suggest longer aging, so drink now and until 2022. Screwcap.",Austria-Kremstal-Riesling
"Though already four years old, this blend of 77% Zinfandel and 23% Petite Sirah shows lots of promise for a long-lasting wine. Complicated aromas of tobacco and ripe boysenberries become sagebrush herbs on the palate, bolstered by blueberry and elderberry fruits. The tannic grip is still strong, so drink 2018–2028.",US-California-Red Blend
"A slight whiff of leathery funk in the nose carries into the palate, but it does not override the rich cherry fruit. Extra details of mineral and earth bring further interest, and more bottle age may serve to lengthen the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

The alcohol is remarkably low, yet the wine is thoroughly dry.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"A Cabernet-dominated, Bordeaux-style blend, the Electrum is tannic, dark and earthy. Its cassis fruit is cloaked in rich, dense layers of graphite, espresso and dark chocolate. The density is impressive and suggests that a decade or more in the cellar may prove rewarding.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Black cherry and cassis aromas are bold but basic. This feels fiercely tannic and astringent. Meaty flavors of cherry and black plum end with dried berry notes, prune and rock-hard tannic bite. Give this more time if possible, but like many 2013s it might never soften and improve.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinto Fino
"This is a frankly delicious young Cabernet, hailing from a small vineyard to showcase its qualities. It's deeply flavored in blackberries and currants, with the most delicious dark chocolate sweetness. Yet it also has the tannic backbone to last. It's one of those wines you can drink now, or age for at least six years to see what it can do.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Tastes and feels harsh and acidic, lacking Pinot's voluptuous nature, although there are serious, even complex, flavors of berries, cola, tobacco and spices. With Pinot Noir, texture is everything, and this wine is just a little off.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Nice everyday wine, with pleasant peach, pineapple and pear flavors that finish with a touch of smoky oak and vanilla. It's easy to enjoy this one with ham, crab, corn on the cob or just by itself.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is the fifth vintage for this rare Washington version of Petite Sirah. It is almost jet black in the center, purple at the rim, tight and tannic with plenty of acid sculpting the earthy, black cherry fruit. Loaded into the finish are layers of earth, iodine, tar and licorice; it's very well made and retains just enough roughness to satisfy lovers of this often rustic grape.",US-Washington-Petite Sirah
"This wine unfolds with aromas of underbrush, toasted sensations and black fruit with a whiff of balsamic herbs. The palate delivers vibrant black cherry, black currant and oak-driven flavors including coffee and chocolate. It finishes on an astringent note of wood tannins. The Marchetto Company, Imports Inc., Pio Imports.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"The first 2007 reds from Spain are now appearing, and it seems like talk of a tough vintage are being confirmed. This wine is sheer and miserly. The nose is gaseous, while the flavors of blackberry and spice are seared by sharp, overt acidity. Shrill and not nearly as generous as the '06.",Spain-Northern Spain-Mencía
"Aromas of sweet melon and honey suggest an innocuous quality that's confirmed on the palate, where basic apple and pear flavors come across a bit sweet. Finishes with some scour and a little harshness.",Argentina-Other-Chardonnay
"A beautifully deep shade of purple, this bottling shows tightly wound aromas of blueberry, black currant, violet and licorice on the nose. The palate's dark fruit flavors are lifted by touches of cocoa and espresso, framed by tannins that are very chalky but not obtrusive.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's some sharpness in this wine, as well as a touch of unripeness. Still, it offers plenty of raspberry and cherry fruit, and is nice and silky, with plenty of sweet oak. Not likely to develop, so drink up.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Designed by Delicato winemaker James Ewart as a Pinot with power that can handle a steak, this wine features a dense, dark nose, with blackberry, olallieberry and red currant cut by allspice, clove and licorice-vanilla cookies. The palate is rich and luxurious, with ripe cranberry and red-cherry elements spiced up with mocha, cappuccino and long-lingering vanilla bean. It's boisterous and fresh, so drink now with a juicy rib-eye.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Deep ruby to the eye, this wine has a nose of fruits of the wood with a hint of roasted tomato. Tannins are surprisingly soft considering the depth of flavor, most notably black cherry, cranberry and smoke with touches of saddle leather. Velvety tannins cascade toward a finish that is equal parts bright and smoky.",Israel-Judean Hills-Red Blend
"This blend of barrique-aged Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon has a fragrance of oak and bell pepper. The palate shows red currant, cherry, oak, coffee and chocolate notes. Although it has generous fruit, it lacks complexity and is shy on freshness and vitality.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"These old vines produce a powerful wine, that retains strong flavors of stem and earth despite the extra ripeness in 2012. The red berry fruit slides into suggestions of tomato juice.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"An extremely smoky nose—to the point of drowning out all of the other scents—leads into a tannic, chalky palate that bears little varietal character.",US-Washington-Tempranillo
"The winery rarely produces single-vineyard bubblies, so when they do, it's because their team believes in the bottling. And when you taste this 100% Chardonnay, you understand why. It's dry and rich in acidity, with yeasty lees and toast that frame gorgeous tangerine, Meyer lemon, lime and vanilla bean flavors. The mousse is ultrarefined, making it great for drinking now. This sparking wine could age until at least 2024, gradually losing effervescence and primary fruit but gaining in subtlety.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"There's no denying the intensity of this 60-40 blend, but could we dial up the ripeness just a little bit? This is tart almost to the point of sourness, with lemony flavors that last a good long time. Pair it with raw shellfish for best effect.",Australia-Western Australia-Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon
"Classic Rutherford Cab. Dry, dusty and slightly herbal, with refined, jammy flavors of red and black cherries, currants, mocha and cedar. The alcohol is a little high, giving this 100% Cabernet a warm, full-bodied feel. The tannins suggest mid-term aging. 2013–2018.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Somewhere between off-dry and sweet, this Riesling features orange, tropical fruit and honey flavors, with a refreshing cut of acidity. It saw no oak.",US-California-Riesling
"A surefire success in all the Milbrandt vineyard holdings, Syrah shows stuffing and spine here. It's firm, herbal and earthy, with a lightly funky aspect. But the fruit is there in support—black cherries and blackberries—and the hint of toast and mocha in the finish provides exactly the right send-off into the next sip.",US-Washington-Syrah
"The aromas of milk chocolate, cherry and spice bring immediate appeal. The flavors are silky and polished, showing equal parts fruit and barrel.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
La Poderina's Rosso offers elegant notes of fine spice backed by small forest berries and currants. This wine excels at being intense and powerful but in a uniquely understated way. The finish is silky and smooth.,Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso

"Crisp, clean and easy to drink, this Mendocino Chardonnay is all lemon and just-ripe pear, with a smooth texture. Pair with lemon chicken or wintertime crab.",US-California-Chardonnay
The wine is spicy with a fine tang of spirit and wood to give it a real tawny character. Acidity is there as well for the lift at the end. It is mature while keeping its dried fruit flavors and a rich aftertaste.,Portugal-Port-Port
"The private wine label of consulting enologist Stefano Chioccioli, Altadonna is a relatively new line. This expression is redolent of lemon, lime, green apple and honeydew.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Fat, simple wine that offers ripe apples, but misses out on acidity. The finish has a candied character.",France-France Other-Sparkling Blend

"This is a soft wine, fruity without great definition. A ripe, red fruit character contrasts with a bitter acidity. It is ready to drink. The blend is 50/50 Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"Mature berry, underbrush, leather, fennel and a whiff of grilled herb meld together in the glass. The firm, vibrant palate shows ripe wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice, coffee and a balsamic note while bracing, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Give this a few years to come together. Drink after 2020.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Pear drop aromas still dominate on the nose but yeasty spice breaks through. The palate is a similar mix of savory yeast and herbal flavors with the freshness of crunchy, green pear. This is inviting, savory and refreshing. The pepperiness of Grüner which is so often absent is abundant here. A wine with real personality and verve.",Austria-Weinviertel-Grüner Veltliner
"From a 300-acre property in Castellina in Chianti, Trasolo (100% Merlot) is a top-shelf wine with rich opulence and sophistication. Deep layers of cherry, blackberry, spice and leather are folded tight together and the wine is smooth and enduring on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Merlot
"There's a light nectarine touch on the nose of this bottling, alongside coconut and Bosc pear aromas and a kiss of oak. It's a tad ripe on the palate, with lemon cream flavors, but compelling acidity, grippy structure and lime pith bitterness all keep it in check.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The first Pinot Noir release from this producer, this is a velvety-smooth, exotic and charming wine, light on the palate despite a concentration of ripe, rich fruit. Kirsch, cherry, raspberry and cinnamon combine to make the wine invitingly lush and plush.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Opaque in color, with heady aromas of berry fruits, copious oak and minerality, this is a generous and fiery red blend. In the mouth, the feel is hot and edgy; flavors of molasses, roasted berry fruits and smoked meat finish hollow.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Aromas of generic red-berry fruits, leather and a drop of vinegar feed into a grabby palate with medicinal red-berry flavors. This tastes a touch herbal on a standard finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"90–92. Barrel sample. This is an herbaceous, cool wine that shows fresh pear and lime flavor. It does have a sense of structure that gives density and texture on the finish.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon share equal parts of this blend. Aromas of corn silk, tropical fruit and herb give way to full-bodied fruit flavors. It shows a hint of warmth on the finish but largely carries it.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This is a rich wine, soft and juicy. Superripe—perhaps overripe—fruit gives a jammy character to the wine. The core woody flavor from aging in French and American oak is prominent and needs to round out. Drink from 2017.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
91–93. Barrel sample. The second wine of Château Valandraud is richly powered by spice from new wood and delicate acidity. It's smooth—showing opulent tannins—and attractive freshness.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A lush and tropical-fruit driven Chard; ripe notes of papaya, mango and apricot flood the nose and mouth. It's rich and heavy in the mouth, but with good enough cut to keep things from being too sweet or cloying.",Israel-Galilee-Chardonnay
"So, why not take advantage of the appellation name to declare a wine spirit of seduction? You''ll find soft, ripe and warm fruits, delicious juiciness and well integrated tannins.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This light wine offers attractive black currant fruitiness. Burnt tannins from the wood aging give it a bitter edge, although the aftertaste does bring back the freshness of the vintage.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This lean wine delivers oak sensations of espresso, vanilla, coffee bean and oak extract but the fruit has all dried up.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"There's a bright, almost Ribena-like quality to the fruit in this wine, with underlying hints of wood and mint. It's full bodied, but the tannins are modest and softly rounded, making it deceptively easy to down. Drink now–2018.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A rich, round and silky texture provide pure pleasure in this exotically perfumed vineyard-designate that's full bodied and exuberant in baked plum, black pepper and anise. Well integrated and complex, it traffics in deeper, darker plumes of smoke and tobacco toward the lengthy finish.",US-California-Malbec
"Jean-Marc Lafont's 2.8 acres of sandstone soil in this area of Moulin-à-Vent has produced a ripe, solidly structured wine. Wood aged and with a rich, tight texture and firm tannins, it is a cru wine to age. It is a bold ripe wine, ready to drink from 2019.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"89-91 Barrel sample. A big wine, with intense dark tannins and great concentration. This is a wine of power, somewhat rough around the edges. To finish, great juiciness.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Fresh, spicy and crisp, this deft Malbec shines with pretty raspberry fruit and sharp acidity. Focused and clean, it's a big step forward for this winery.",US-Washington-Malbec
"The soft, open character of Menetou-Salon is very apparent in this gentle, fruity wine. With fresh acidity and bright citrus and apricot flavors, it's a wine to savor young. Light perfumes add interest to this wine that is ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc

"This fruity Syrah is rich in cherries, raspberries, white chocolate and spices. Syrah hardly gets more flamboyant. And yet its structure is firm and pleasant. Drink now–2016.",US-California-Syrah

"Overripe, with raisin and prune flavors that finish sweet, hot and bitter in tannins.",US-California-Zinfandel

"A blend of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Merlot, this bold wine conveys earthy aromas of blackberry, leather, tilled soil and a balsamic note.

The lingering finish closes on a note of ground black pepper.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"This oak-aged blend of equal parts Pinot Bianco and Chardonnay opens with a beautifully intense bouquet of vanilla bean, peach cobbler and citrus mousse. White almond and toasted spice make for rich accents on the long fresh finish.",Italy-Tuscany-White Blend
"Earthy, murky aromas of cherry and plum lack freshness and brightness. This wine is jammy and a bit clumsy on the palate, with saucy, savory berry and plum flavors. An herbal, jammy-tasting finish leaves you wanting more.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Big, rich and rounded, this is as much a wine about sweet tropical fruits as about spiciness. It has weight, concentration and a full, honeyed character. For the wine to fully integrate, it should be aged over 3–4 years.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"This wine inspires a pairing with foods that have a sweet cheese or butter element. It is well shaped and opulent, with loads of crushed black pepper, dried fruit and  dusty mineral nuances.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"Smells damp and murky, with raisin and other sweet berry aromas along with some mulch. The palate brings more freshness, but it's grabby and tannic as it delivers prune, raisin and berry flavors in front of coffee and herbs on the finish. Good but smells and tastes a little overripe.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This wine is all about fruit—ripe, velvety in texture and rich on the palate. It is dense, black in character without allowing the natural tannins of the Tannat to dominate. With its fruit, it will develop over the medium term. Drink from 2017.",France-Southwest France-Red Blend
"A shy nose of blueberry jelly, lilac and a touch of black tea show on this wine from a project connected to the Thomas Fogarty team. Light red plum, tart pomegranate and even raspberry show on the palate, where a dainty structure proves easy to sip, with additional chipped-slate minerality.",US-California-Merlot
"Overripe and Port-like, this has chocolate, raisin and blackberry jam flavors. It's rich, and it has a prickly heat that comes from the high alcohol.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lovely notes of ripe apple with an orange peel touch play on the nose. They also appear on the dry, juicy and very fruit-driven palate. All is driven and slender, fresh but ripe. The fruit is so burgeoning that this is still juicy, even on the apple-scented finish.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"This elegant blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet and Canaiolo displays fragrant floral aromas of red roses, violets and dried lavender. There's fruit, too, but it takes the shape of cassis and dried berries. The wine finishes with polished tannins and a smoky touch of white mushrooms or leather.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"This is a tasty, juicy, easy-drinking wine with good fruit flavors. Well balanced and medium bodied, it offers some of the density and texture expected, but without going over the top in tannins.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Light and delicate on the nose, this single-vineyard Chardonnay shows white peach, honeysuckle and browned butter on the nose. There is good tension to the sip, but also riper flavors of apple cider, pan-seared pear and lemon preserves.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Dense, concentrated and firm, this wine has a powerful, rich structure that promises well. Big berry fruits and dark tannins are developing well together. The wine is full of promise so drink from 2020. Fifteen-percent of the 74 acres of vines are more than 120 years old. New York banker Robert G. Wilmers bought Haut-Bailly in 1998 from the Sanders family, owners since 1955. Véronique Sanders-van Beek has run the estate since then.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Soft red fruits dominate this only lightly structured wine. It is more about juicy Pinot Noir, fruity with raspberry and red-currant flavors. Dryness at the core of the wine adds shape. The wine is ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This wine has more body and a richer mouthfeel than many of its peers, with mild floral and almond flavors and a touch of butterscotch.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"Juicy acids brighten up the mouthfeel, with pineapple, citrus and black-cherry-cola flavors commingling. This was aged nine months in 20% new French barrels.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"The name is a nod to the use of all five Bordeaux red grapes. The result is familiar, with aromas of dried herbs laced across blackberry fruit. Relatively light and herb-driven, the palate discloses elderberry flavors and lots of woodiness.",US-California-Meritage
"Made entirely from Cabernet Sauvignon, Nemo is hard to analyze. It has typical Cabernet plum and cassis aromas, but also the scent of pickles. The palate is very soft, especially compared to the estate's Chianti. Flavorsof soy sauce, licorice and green pepper make for a confusing palate. It has its virtues, but also some faults. Hence the rating.",Italy-Tuscany-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Somewhat smoky and earthy on the nose, but also with some harshness that could be chalked up to youth. Acidity is a bit too high and there's some pickle to the bouquet and flavor profile. On the plus side, as it opens core flavors of raspberry and red plum come across as solid.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Merlot
"A full blast of oak and related aromas open this creamy, ripe wine. Plump on the palate but with just enough acidity to preserve balance, this rich, friendly wine features walnut, papaya and citrus flavors that finish woody, smooth and long. Drink now.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"Made from 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this blend is firm in tannins and stuffed with lovely flavors of blackberry, cherry, currant, grilled meat, pepper, exotic spice and cedar.

"Wood spice, cherry and herb aromas are followed by luscious cherry flavors. It keeps you coming back for more with a high yum factor.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Still young and with strong wood aging flavors, this is otherwise a light wine where the fruit is reticent. Bitter cherry flavors show through along with acidity, and the wine obviously needs time to settle down. Drink from 2016.",France-Alsace-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of toast, espresso and mature plum lead to a tightly wound palate that offers roasted coffee bean, licorice and walnut alongside tough, astringent tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A solid, somewhat generic Cab with sweet cassis and raspberry aromas as a greeting. The palate is a little candied but it rolls out tasty, dense red-fruit flavors. It doesn't sport much Cabernet typicity but it delivers ripe flavors and a smooth ride.",Chile-Aconcagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of barrel spice and vanilla lead the charge on this Tinto Fino that also contains 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. A tough, tannin-driven palate deals toasty flavors of black fruits, char and chocolate, which carry over to the finish. Call this an oak bomb, but at the very least the oak is of high quality and well integrated. Drink through 2025.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This offers a surprisingly savory look at this sun-drenched appellation, with aromas of smoke, mineral and Kalamata olives. The cherry flavors are full bodied with a palate-coating, slightly tacky feel that smooths out over time.",US-Washington-Syrah
"A big, juicy Pinot Noir, rich and opulent, with flavors ranging from cherry pie and bacon through Dr. Pepper cola to the most succulent, meaty heirloom tomato you ever had. Exotically spicy and complex, and the overall result is delicious. Fine now and for the next 4–6 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Despite this estate remaining among the top echelon of New Zealand Riesling producers, Framingham's Pinot Noir is solid but unexciting. It's plump and medium bodied, and it offers modest cherry fruit and a touch of bitterness on the finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir

"There is some of the structure characteristic of 2010 Beaujolais in this wine, but it is mainly dominated by a red cherry flavor and fresh acidity. It's ripe, fruity and ready to drink.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This wine is 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc, 20% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot. The aromas are almost completely shut down at present, with just hints of barrel spice, herb and dark fruit. The fruit flavors are similarly locked up, backed by lightly grainy tannins. There are good things going on but it needs time to reveal itself. Best after 2022.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"While there is ample pear fruit on nose and palate, bitter pith notes seem to be dominant. Alcoholic heat is palpable on the midpalate. The finish is dry and returns to the fruity pear notes.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris

Layers of toast, coffee and ripe red fruit reveal themselves to the nose with deep spice and clove that last long on the palate. This wine boasts solid structure and power.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"Widely accessible and hedonistic aromas of cherry pie with a tinge of wild mint lead the nose on this young but ready county blend.

"This big, concentrated effort is currently closed, but it's already hinting at ripe black fruits, solid tannins and a long future. On the finish, acidity and a black currant note give the wine a final lift. Keep this for at least five years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Smoky berries and black cherry mix with crushed grapeseed and a dried-mint element on the nose of this bottling. Dill, dried oregano and a touch of thyme pop on the palate, where deep and dark elderberry flavors are framed by sticky tannins.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Starts with clean cedary aromas and bold cassis scents, then slowly works in flavors of coffee, licorice and earth. It's medium- to full-bodied, with a dusty, tannic finish. Hold a couple of years, then try with stews or braises.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Red Blend
"Simple strawberry aromas come with stalky side notes. In the mouth, this is tannic while also coming across syrupy. Baked flavors of molasses, stewed plum and nutmeg end in a syrupy, cooked finish.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Savory touches of saffron and bee pollen lend complexity to this lithe, dancing spätlese. It's intensely sunny in character, bursting of honey and sweet tangerine flavors, yet held firm and tight by a backbone of reverberating lemon acidity. Drink now through 2021.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling

"The wine is tight with a strong mineral element over the acidity. It shows a sense of chalky terroir, full of red-currant fruits and a nervy aftertaste. It will take some time to fully develop, so wait until 2023.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"It may be that this wine needs time in the cellar, but right now, it's tough and tannic. There are some fine blackberry, cassis, spicy plum and cedar flavors, and it could blossom after 2008 for a few years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"In Pinot Noir, you get what you pay for. Granted, MaManis's 2010 is a pretty simple wine. But it is classic in the silky structure and pleasant raspberry and cherry flavors, touched with smoky oak, and is one of the better Pinots at this price.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Lots of rich, spicy blackberry, chocolate and bacon flavors in this Syrah. It's smooth in the mouth, with some scoury tannins. Good for drinking over the next 2–3 years, especially with lamb.",US-California-Syrah
"Richly perfumed with layers of plum and clove, this is a soft, fully developed Cab Franc. Textured and subtle in herbs, it delivers a long, peppery finish. Generous and satisfying in terms of mouthfeel, it'll serve nicely on its own or with an herb-dusted roast chicken or Liberty duck.",US-California-Cabernet Franc

"This soft, robustly ripe wine shows a raisin-like prune character, tasting somewhat chalky on the palate.",US-California-Zinfandel

"Ripe green pear and a leafy, savory edge of watercress with a phenolic dimension on the mouthfeel create a rich and concentrated wine. The rounded palate demands food.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"One of the properties managed by Georges Vigouroux, this is located on the plateau, close to eastern edge of Cahors. The wine is rich, smooth and broad. A strong tannic structure is masked by the big, rounded black fruits and acidity. That makes for a wine that can be drunk soon, although it will be better from 2017.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"One of Altocedro's better efforts starts with meaty, ripe, chunky black fruit aromas and a wave of mocha, cocoa and berry syrup. It's a creamy specimen but has enough acidity and vitality to not run flat. Mocha, carob and plum extend through the finish. Drink now.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec

It boasts blueberry, black cherry, dark chocolate and cinnamon flavors, its plush texture carrying them long into the finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Almost as light in color as water, this is a straight-ahead take on the grape, with tropical-leaning aromas of honeysuckle, ripe papaya and boisterous passionfruit. The palate is much grassier in style, showing cut lawn, kiwi, green pears and kaffir limes, with just a touch of lingering tropical sweetness.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"A bit heavy for Pinot Noir, this has extracted red-berry, cola and mocha flavors. It lacks finesse, but makes up for it in sheer deliciousness. There is a certain sylishness tannins and acids, courtesy of its Arroyo Grande origins. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Cedar aromas mingle with cherry and mixed berries on the nose, giving way to earth and cinnamon flavors on the elegant palate. With little tannin and moderate acidity, this is a wine for drinking over the next year.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Showing the rustic edge that sometimes characterizes wines from Listrac, this still offers smooth new wood and tight blackberry fruit flavors. It is still developing, with the wood probably too prominent.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Plenty of ripe black currant, licorice and cedar flavors in this dry, full-bodied young Cabernet. It feels luxurious in the mouth, with a depth and spicy finish that are notable. Drink by 2017.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

Delicious and forward, and should hold steady over the next six years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The importance of a great vintage is evident in this crianza holdover from the lauded 2001 harvest. The wine is loaded with cola, root beer, molasses and leather aromas, while the flavors of earthy cherry, plum and raspberry are subtle and upright, yet still a touch angular. Will go well with food; drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"The nose is concentrated and dark, with currant, plum and mocha driving the aromas.

A dusting of cracked pepper and stone linger on the finish.",US-Virginia-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Dark, oaky and fiery on the nose, but soft and globular in the mouth, with raisin and prune flavors. The finish is heavy and dark, but severely raisiny. This is a bit overripe.",Argentina-Other-Malbec
"This fascinating nonvintage solera blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc from five vintages (2010–2014) offers elegant touches of licorice, blackcurrant and lavender on the deep nose. Blackberry, cedar, sandalwood and incense flavors mesh with a dried tea-leaf element on the palate.",US-California-Red Blend
"Layers of tannins lie easily over the ripe fruit in this wine. It has a light structure, showing more of the smooth, mature fruits that make it soft and ready to drink. Acidity at the end keeps the freshness. Drink now.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay

"This is a solid example of a Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc: Bright and fruit forward with attractive stone fruit and lemon verbena notes on the nose, while lemon-lime popsicle carries on the palate. The body shows some weight and a slippery texture to keep all that acid in check.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc

Toasty and lightly oaky on the finish; 73% Malbec and 27% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Over the years Mondavi's Reserve has taken a turn toward Chablis. Fans of lush, superripe Chards will find it tart, but it's really balanced and elegant. With a dry tang of minerals, it shows bright Meyer lemon, lime, pineapple and white peach flavors. One-third new oak adds creamy, smoky vanilla complexities. Should develop over the next six years.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Intensely crisp and mineral, this wine puts forth bright citrus flavors for its refreshing fruitiness. It is a light, lively and immediately drinkable wine, with brisk texture and acidity. Worth aging, but very drinkable now. Screwcap.",Austria-Kremstal-Riesling
"Mild, melony aromas are tropical in nature and show an oily note of lanolin. This feels heavy, while pithy flavors of melon are full of skin-based pyrazines. Green, bitter flavors taste more of grape skins than fruit.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Chardonnay
"Earthy pollen and dusty mineral notes extend from nose to finish on this slightly rustic Gewürztraminer, casting a shadow to more classic tones of lychee, rose petal and grapefruit. Its delicate body and balanced alcohol lend a refreshing quaffability.",US-New York-Gewürztraminer

This shows the grape's promise, offering both crispness and creaminess on the palate and finish.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"Tasted alongside the 2013, this is bigger, bolder, fruitier and more powerful, yet a touch less refined. The strawberry and cherry fruit is underscored with a pleasing minerality. The tannins are substantial and in proportion. A hint of chicken stock runs through the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"This is a blend from several vineyard sites, including Banfield, Saitone, Carlisle, Montafi and Papera, each boasting more than 100-year-old vines. A chocolate cordial note dominates the palate, as bold cherry, rhubarb, cinnamon and citrus flavors wander in. It's a steal for the price, too.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Lychee and mango aromas waft from this delicate wine. Off-dry in style, it's unusually brisk on the palate with crisp stone-fruit flavors and bright tangerine acidity. It closes with a lacy sweetness.",US-New York-Gewürztraminer

"Freshly cut quince, guava, lemongrass and key lime aromas combine with a stony quality on the nose of this vibrant, zesty wine.

"This is the first vintage for Upright—100% Klipsun Vineyard and 100% varietal Merlot. Thick and syrupy, it's a full throttle wine, with deep flavors of berry, cherry and cassis. Red licorice lightly streaks through the back end, and the wine makes a smooth landing on a strip of Bourbon barrel notes.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Showing the hard tannins and dryness of a young Petite Sirah, this is the kind of wine you normally would cellar. But there's a little streak of green unripeness that suggests aging will lead nowhere. So drink it now with big, lusty fare.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Concentrated and powerful, this wine comes from one of the grandest estates in the Douro, now owned by the Symington family. Full of rich fruit along with layers of firm tannins, it is solid, dark and will age well, giving an impressive wine from 2020.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red

"An awesome Chardonnay. Explodes in the mouth with massive pineapple, crème brûlée, apricot jam and new oak flavors that finish thoroughly dry.

"This showy wine has maple syrup aromas, extremely ripe and almost unctuous flavors, lots of spicy oak influence and full body.

Structured, but soft in the mouth, with a caramel finish.",US-California-Red Blend
"This is an extremely smooth Syrah, another reminder of how well the Rhône grape does when planted in California's cooler Pinot Noir climates. Licorice and boysenberry characterize the nose, with the combination of rich fruit and peppery spice framing the palate. The lingering vanilla finish kicks it up even one more notch.",US-California-Syrah

"Tastes sweet and honeyed in pineapple and lemon Lifesaver candy, with a sharp cut of acidity that tastes almost unnatural. Feels overly manipulated, but will appeal to lots of people.",US-California-Viognier
"Showing the structure of the vintage, while missing some of the flesh. The wine has a dry, firm and tannic core that hides the red fruit flavors. The wine, still on the austere side, will be ready to drink in a year.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"There is plenty of the power and structure of a Vosne-Romanée in this single parcel wine. It has density and concentration over a rich full black-fruit character. There are still signs of the wood aging and some high toast flavors that need to integrate, so wait until 2020.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Thick, soft and sweetly extracted in blackberries and licorice, this Syrah can best be described as rustic. It's not bad, just simple.",US-California-Syrah
"One barrel from each of the three estate vineyards contributed to this reserve.

It's delicious now, and it should hold for up to a decade.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Earthy aromas of leather, tilled soil, ripe dark-skinned berry and a funky whiff of game lead the way. The robust, chewy palate delivers juicy black cherry, raspberry, cake spice and dried herb alongside hearty, tightly wound tannins that will carry this through 2023.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"With light wood-aging flavors, this wine is both ripe and fresh. The touch of toast points up yellow fruits that are generous and rounded.

"Aromas recall dried herbs, blueberry, dill and vanilla. The palate brings rich blue fruit and cocoa flavors backed by firm, slightly dry tannins.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Harsh and dry in tannins and acids, with weedy flavors of cherries, herbs and mint. Has a nice, silky texture, but not going anywhere.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This own-rooted block is usually blended into Peter Hunken's larger bottling, but this extra-special vintage thankfully got its own stage. Dense boysenberry, black peppercorns, asphalt, charred lamb, dried violets, lilacs and lavender show on the tarry yet floral nose. The palate is zesty with acidity but deep with flavor, offering thyme, soy, rosemary and more peppercorns. It's ideal for a lamb or game dish.",US-California-Syrah
"Dense, heavy aromas of roasted berry fruits and hickory are challenging. This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot shows rubbery tannins and flavors of bacon, clove and hickory that are clearly oak-based. A salty, shearing finish ends with a recurrence of a clove flavor.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Red Blend

"This estate-grown wine conjures up thoughts of pepper steak in a glass, so spicy and tannic on the palate that it begs for succulent meat with which to pair. Full bodied and roundly soft, its burst of blueberry fruit is juicy and expansive, mellowing on the finish.",US-California-Malbec

"The winery aims for Loire valley characteristics in its wines, hence the reference to Côt, as Malbec is known in the region. This is grapy, purple and young. At this point it's difficult to see much else beyond the fruit and lip-sticking acids. It's a good warm-weather quaffing wine, best served slightly chilled.",US-Oregon-Malbec
"Deep purple/black in color, this wine carries varietal scents of violets and cassis, with fresh and focused flavors following. The mix of black cherry, black licorice, chalk and tobacco is complex and powerful, and that power and balance continue through the long finish.",US-Oregon-Cabernet Franc

"Aggressive smelling early on but then it settles on classy raspberry, cassis and herbs. The palate is very healthy, juicy, rich and big, but the flavors of dark berry fruit are subtle and smooth. Chunky, sweet and ripe on the finish. A Malbec to drink this winter. Only 300 cases produced.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"An estate wine from an elevated elevation, this opens in fragrant red cherry and vanilla, with a subtle trace of brambly blackberry. Soft, it features a supple mouthfeel, medium weight and a backbone of structure, earthy and enticing.

"Boundary Breaks is an exciting new project from the Finger Lakes, and the No. 239 is one of its best. While ebulliently fruity, almost tropical, on the nose, it's elegantly dry on the palate with a rich, creamy palate full of ripe grapefruit and peach flavors. Vibrant lemon-lime acidity, it finishes long with a hint of lime-skin pith.",US-New York-Riesling

Juicy boysenberries, composted earth, iron filings and veins of coffee liqueur and licorice compound into a long finish.",US-Oregon-Syrah

"Leesy, toasty opening aromas accent melon, flower blossom and stone fruit scents. This is woody but healthy in feel, with acidic lift. Flavors of resiny, briny melon and peach finish with a wave of barrel-driven vanilla, but overall this shows coastal freshness and proper balance.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Chardonnay
"Expertly integrated aromas of black plum, vanilla cola, light clove, pralines and a touch of caramel cream show on the nose of this bottling by a Sta. Rita Hills producer that sourced from up north. Wild berries, red cherry and black raspberry pop on the palate, where an earthy tension of chipped slate meets with a baked goods richness.",US-California-Grenache
"This earns its Best Buy designation for the rich, creamy orange, peach and tropical fruit flavors and the note of caramel-tinged vanilla from oak aging. It tastes sweet, but it provides what many consumers love about Chardonnay.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Blended from 70% Syrah, 18% Mourvèdre and 12% Grenache, this concentrated refresher offers light, crisp waves of vanilla-cherry, grapefruit and orange. It will remain restrained in the glass if not revelatory in ripe fruit.",US-California-Rosé
"This gorgeous Zinfandel comes from a vineyard on Bradford Mountain at 1,000 feet elevation, with the vines planted in red, volcanic soils. The palate explodes in juicy plum flavor, with a silky, velvety texture and satisfying cinnamon and pepper spice that plays off the fruit. It's a structured and fresh selection.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This is a potentially fine wine, spoilt by high alcohol. The structure is dense and with enough acidity and solid tannins. The alcohol is the problem, derived from fruit that tastes overripe.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"The aromas are quite subdued, making you strain to get at them. The palate brings rounded full-feeling apple and melon flavors that drop off at the finish.",US-Washington-Chardonnay

"Clove, bay leaf and black cherry aromas burst from the glass, followed by flavors of dark cherry and cocoa. The tannins are supple, the mouthfeel ample, and the finish ends with a refreshing lift of acidity. Drink now–2018.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Toasty, roasted aromas of baked berry and earth head straight to a narrowly built yet weighty palate with earth, plum and raspberry notes. On the finish, this holds onto its plum and raspberry flavors as well as its fresh feel.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo-Garnacha
"The first vintage of this wine from this site, it offers a lot to like, from crisp, pretty aromas and tingly acidity to nuanced whispers of honeycomb, Gravenstein apple and fennel. Light bodied, it has nice firmness and tension to the mouthfeel, and an overall balance of fruit and complexity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Lightly hued and luminous, this opens with aromas of wild cherry, blue flower, chopped herb and a balsamic note. The structured, refined palate offers dried cherry, ripe strawberry, white pepper, cinnamon and a hint of clove set against a backbone of firm, polished tannins. Drink 2018–2026.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Composed berry aromas meet expectations for Tinto Fino from Ribera del Duero. A stout, tannic palate is firm but not too hard or impermeable. Flavors of blackberry and cherry come with dry, woody accents, while peppery blackness rises up on a drawing finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Swanson does a good job of crafting a dry, crisp, mouthwatering Pinot Grigio with little or no oak influence. The acidity is juicy, making the apple, citrus and wildflower flavors savory. Good white with today's wide range of ethnic fare.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"Penetrating tones of stone, lemon and wax lend a stately feel to this dry, intensely mineral Riesling. It's full-bodied in style with a rich, rounded mouthfeel, but invigorated with acidity on the finish.",Germany-Nahe-Riesling
"As you might infer from the name, this tastes sweet. It appeals to consumers who enjoy the trend of sugary red wines. You could almost drink it as a dessert sipper, with its candied blackberry and cherry flavors.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Spicy cherry and plum aromas are dark yet austere. Racy, acidic and full of energy across the palate, this coastal Pinot delivers snappy beams of red plum and raspberry flavors before a lightly spiced finish that goes the distance.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Pinot Noir
"This is a richly honeyed wine that has flavors of spice cake and sweet fruits that are balanced with a taut, firm texture. The wine is ripe, but has a delicate touch that makes it very attractive. Drink now.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Pretty and pale, this wine is already showing some sunset shades around the rim, and drinking like a wine with more than just a couple of years under its belt. That works in its favor, as it offers cherry-pie fruit, cut tobacco, some minerality and a chocolate/coffee kiss in the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Given the $27 price, this “limited edition” Sauvignon is lacking in many places. The nose is challenging, with a strong scent of bathroom cleanser, while the palate delivers acid and citrusy flavors but no middle tier. On the finish, it's like scallions and tarragon, with cutting acidity.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"The aromas pop with notes of funk, smoked meat, red fruit, flowers, stems and orange peel. It's compact out of the gate with concentrated, tightly wound, salty flavors of olive brine, crushed rock and violets. It shows an exquisite sense of balance and a crazy long finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Bergamot leaf and sea breezes are conjured up in this streamlined, sleek and ultradry Riesling. This is fresh but sunny, ripe but svelte. Just what you need on a hot summer day. The lip-smacking finish keeps you coming back for more.",Austria-Kremstal-Riesling
"The earthy aromas suggest fresh compost, and wrap around ripe raspberry and cherry fruit that tastes like a fresh baked pie. The mouthfeel remains light, almost airy, with a nod to Beaujolais. Drink this over the next two or three years.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"The nose on this Navarran rosado is briny and strained. The palate is on the heavy side, while flavors of peach pit and citrus peel finish pithy and mildly bitter. This will not age well.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"This is declassified ice wine, picked frozen. It does not have the depth of the other dessert wines from Viento, but it is a remarkable effort, textural and delicate, with threads of straw, honey, cracker, candied tropical fruits and more, but all in a light and delicate style. This could easily become a wine that will amaze people in a blind tasting given the price.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Sometimes you get what you pay for. This value-priced wine is feral smelling and strange on the nose. The palate feel is probably the best part, while the flavors are candied and foxy.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
This estate wine has 10% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon and is made in small quantities. Big-boned tannins surround puckering red fruit like currant and cassis before a brawny dusting of clove and black pepper hit on the finish.,US-California-Cabernet Franc

The mouthful is very bold and thick, boasting a playful touch of sweet spice.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Principally a Bordeaux-style blend, with some Oregon Zinfandel included, this is toasty and dark, a muscular wine offering strawberry preserves, cassis, cola and a swirl of smoke. Quite young and fruit-powered, it's got the concentration to develop further 2018–2020.",US-Oregon-Red Blend
"Dark in color, this delivers black fruit aromas along with a toasty note. While it's slightly hollow in the middle, it's wide around the edges, tasting of mossy blackberry and herb. The finish is toasty, big and grabby.",Chile-Curicó Valley-Merlot
"Here's an easygoing red that opens with aromas of dark-skinned berry and baking spice. The soft, round palate yields juicy black cherry, ground black pepper and freshness. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy soon.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"Alain and Céline Vidal's second brand (they also own Château Dubraud) is a fruity blend of Merlot (60%), Cabernet Sauvignon (25%) and Cabernet Franc (15%) although the smoky wood flavors also have an important place. Red berries and black currants partner with acidity and firm tannins. The wine is still developing so drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Attractive floral scents of crushed rose and pressed violet are joined by perfumed berry and a hint of menthol. The elegant, focused palate delivers wild cherry, raspberry, white pepper, clove and chopped herb alongside a firm network of fine-grained tannins. It's still young and tight but loaded with finesse. Drink 2019–2031.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Oregon Pinot Noir is no rarity, except when it bears the Walla Walla appellation, as this one does. Made using fruit from the Couse Creek Vineyard, this is lovely from the first sniff. A wealth of earthy and herbal scents, dusty spices and brambly berries make this memorable. It finishes with medium weight and a whiff of truffle.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
This ripe blackberry-flavored wine is deliciously ready to drink. It has soft tannins and a smooth texture that is now just right. The acidity and the jammy aftertaste make the wine attractive.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"At 15.9% abv, this is a monster by Finger Lakes standards, but it's unsurprising perhaps for such a hot vintage. A tad jammy on the palate, it's sweet with red cherry fruit that's framed by herbaceous green notes and layers of soft, furry tannins.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"Raspberry, plum and floral aromas are clean but nothing special or unusual. This basic Rioja feels sturdy and solid, while flavors of spicy oak accent plum and berry fruit. A medium-long finish with resiny, peppery notes is a touch hot.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This wine doesn't seem to have fully ripened. Aromas that veer into the green compete with coffee, plum and woodspice. It's light and soft but concentrated in flavor, making up for any aromatic deficiencies.",US-Washington-Malbec
"Lemon-lime and lemon curd mark this wine. The lemon theme continues throughout the layers of apple, vanilla and oak, the oak not perceptible until near the round, voluptuous finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Soft and fruity, this opens with aromas of ripe plum, blackberry and dark cooking spice. The juicy, easygoing palate doles out fleshy black cherry, raspberry jam and a hint of ground pepper accompanied by round, smooth tannins.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"From a vineyard that once belonged to the charitable Hospices de Chablis, this is a superrich wine for a Chablis, powered both by acidity and by beautiful ripe fruits. It is bright and tight in character, although it is the richness and the density of the wine that shows most strongly. Drink this powerful wine from 2020.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Starting out reductive, this wine has aromas of wet copper penny, fresh herbs, woodspice and dark fruit. The coffee and black fruit flavors are high octane, seeming out of balance.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is exotic in grapefruit, apricot and honey flavors, with a green veggie streak that's courtesy of the chilly vintage. It's best described as tasting like a sweet-and-sour Chinese sauce.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

"From a site tucked within the eastern hills of the appellation, this is a 100% varietal expression, dark hay in color, sparkling in minerality and sporting a gravelly edge. Stainless steel and one neutral French oak barrel helped ferment and age. Flinty, it shines in lime, peach and pear.",US-California-Grenache Blanc
"Broad, ripe style, concentrated while retaining lightness of touch. There is a good mineral element balancing the yellow fruits and rich texture.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"Tree bark and pine needles mark the aromas, adding woodsy complexity and weight to ripe black cherries. Full and somewhat backward, this needs a few years to sort itself out and fully express its generous nature, but you can sense the future now in its power and velvety texture.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"88-90 Barrel sample. There is a high level of new wood, toast that dominates both the aroma and the flavors. It gives the wine a hard-edged feel at this stage.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine seems sweet, with apricot, orange, lemongrass and vanilla flavors. A good blast of acidity provides balance.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"In a lighter style than other Grüners in the single-vineyard range, this comes from a gravel and loess vineyard close to the Schloss. The wine is fresh, erring on crisp, emphasizing the green and spice Grüner flavors. The aftertaste brings out the acidity.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"Not a wine for drinking now or anytime soon. It's so hard in tannins, it basically locks down the palate, and the astringency seems to accentuate the acidity and dryness. However, there is a deep core of blackberry essence and, after all, this is Montelena. All indications are that it will be a terrific wine in another 8 or 10 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Muted aromatically, it has a light, bright core of cherry lurking in the layers of juicy spice. The grapes come from the Klindt and Wiley Vineyards. Let it breathe or decant before drinking, and enjoy it soon.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Earthy balsamic aromas of cheesy oak, blackberry and cassis feed into a saturated tannic palate that's a touch scratchy and abrasive. Stewy blackberry and cassis flavors come with a dollop of vanilla and cheese, while this ends with muscular, grabby tannins. Drink this rich, heavy Malbec through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A big, fat and rich wine, with tropical fruit flavors. There is spice from the prominent wood with an edge of vanilla. It's a powerhouse of a Chardonnay, ripe and full, the acidity lending crispness to the finish.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Slightly reduced and showing plenty of barrel imprint, this vineyard designate is bold and grippy, its soft entry marked by clove spice and cigar. The fruit is a combination of plum and dark cherry, subtly wrapped in vanilla toast.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This tastes almost like a fortified wine, with strong alcohol heat boosting very dry wild-blackberry, pepper and prune flavors.",US-California-Zinfandel

"Winemaker Barbara Tamburini is a rising star, and her l'Rennero Merlot is outstandingly juicy and succulent. Notes of ripe fruit such as black cherry and blueberry are backed by sweet spice and a rich, plush mouthfeel. The wine is powerful and chewy but also elegant and balanced at the same time.",Italy-Tuscany-Merlot
"Bright, zesty lemon appears alongside yellow Mirabell plum that also pervades the palate. There is linear focus, as befits an icewine made from Riesling—and if you have desserts that feature confit lemon, this is what you need. Incredible that something so rich should be so wonderfully light at the same time.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Riesling
"This dry rosé is 100% Merlot, fermented in stainless steel. It's rather flat in both mouthfeel and flavor, with nondescript one-dimensional red fruit.",US-Oregon-Rosé
"A disappointing effort from this normally reliable winery. There's some dark earth and fruit but it's hard to get at under a veil of charred oak, cellar dirt and alcohol. The finish tastes of coffee grounds. The mouthfeel is fine, the flavors just don't come together. —J.C.",Australia-South Australia-Red Blend
"Crushed rose, pressed violet, perfumed berry, sage and a balsamic note are just some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied red. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, black pepper and licorice alongside tightly knit tannins and the subtle warmth of alcohol. Give it a few more years to come together. Drink 2018–2016.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
This wine's strawberry jam aromas lead to a palate dominated by tannins. It's dry and missing fruit.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Even though there's no new oak on this wine, it tastes oaky. Shows strong buttered toast and butterscotch flavors, with underlying tropical fruits, pears, white flowers and minerals. Very rich and thick, it can be an interesting substitute for a big, buttery Chardonnay.",US-California-Viognier
"A lively, oak-spice aroma leads into bright red fruits and cinnamon tones on the palate. A smooth but lively texture completes the picture for this medium-bodied wine.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A pretty good Pinot Noir, elegantly silky as it should be, with flavors of tart cherries, cola, red licorice and sandalwood. It's a bit too soft and sweet, but easy to drink.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Mauve in color, this cold-fermented pink wine shows crystallized watermelon, effervescent pink lemonade and berry-lime sangria elements on the nose. It's very flavorful once sipped, with pomegranate and rose petal notes, proving ripe and tasty yet not overdone.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Ripe, soft and a little sweet, with jellied flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and anise. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Notable for a soft, buttery creaminess that makes it feel caressing in the mouth. There's just enough acidity to give a boost to the intense lemondrop candy, pineapple, crème brulée and vanilla flavors. Drink up with roast chicken, grilled salmon or portobello mushroom risotto.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This crystalline Galician blend is composed of 95% Godello and Albariño, and it gets going with mellow apple, peach and other white-fruit aromas. The palate has a tangy, citrusy outlook with corresponding flavors of lime, orange and tangerine. Things turn pithy and more chunky on the finish.",Spain-Galicia-White Blend
"Produced from organically grown grapes, this is a ripe, easy and fruity wine. It has light tannins, juicy black-currant fruit and acidity. It is still young, showing off its fruitiness and will be ready to drink soon, from early 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The HJW Vineyard bottling shares the same backbone of mineral and citrus purity common to the producer's entire 2014 Riesling lineup, but with far greater intensity and penetration. Blossomy and perfumed at first, its grapefruit flavor and honed, steely density build on the palate with elegance and power.",US-New York-Riesling
"This is a classic, concentrated but elegant wine, from the wonderful black cherry and forest underbrush aromas to the ripe fruit flavors, full body and polished texture. Aging in 30% new Hungarian barrels gave a subtle spicy accent.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Feels harsh and bitter in the mouth, with simple, sweet flavors of raisins, white sugar and alcohol.",US-California-Syrah
"Sourced from the Bacchus vineyard, this is an oaky, buttery Chardonnay that's fine for an every day quaffer. The oaky flavors quickly overtake fruit that is simple, clean, and apple flavored.",US-Washington-Chardonnay

"The wine is blended with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot. Both bring their distinct contributions, the former in terms of firm tannins and black currants, the latter with a soft mellowness and suggestions of sweet red currants. The ripe red cherries seem to be all Cab Franc's. A layer of milk chocolate adds to the richness. Altogether, it's absolutely delicious and worth stashing in the cellar until 2015 or so. It's one of the best Cab Francs of the vintage.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"This bright Dolcetto d'Alba offers fresh fruit and berry flavors on top of rich concentration and a plush, velvety feel. This is a very easy, uncomplicated wine that will pair with most home-cooked pasta dishes.",Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto

"This wine delivers in flavor and aroma, a refined layering of cherry and strawberry that celebrates what this aromatic clone can do in Russian River Valley. Orange peel and tart, tight acidity combine around a silky texture, with a ginger-spice finish and lingering hint of rose petal.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Woodsy and thickly textured, this Weir Pinot is balanced in just-ripe cherry goodness that neatly scrapes the edge of sour-ness. Fine earth and herbal overtones show off its varietal qualities, more typical of its warmer climate than the Deep End of Anderson Valley.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Textured and with a tight minerality, this is also a potentially generous wine, spicy and showing a creamy character from the wood. Lively acidity cuts through the texture with delicious fruitiness coming from behind to give a lift to this young, still very fresh wine. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Ripe and creamy in texture, this is a pear and peach flavored wine. A touch of butteriness gives a rounded texture and a hint of vanilla. Drink this fruity wine from 2015.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

This entry-level offering delivers a hint of smoky, fumé character, but also plenty of ripe fruit, ranging from fig, melon and stone fruit to zestier notes of passion fruit. It's reasonably full-bodied, with an attractive, silky mouthfeel and a touch of gingery spice on the finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc

Drink after 2016.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"Tight, pure blackberry and cassis aromas are composed. This is a better-balanced wine than the sticky, overly oaked 2012 version. Leading toasty chocolate flavors go well with secondary spiced berry and cassis notes. A note of vanilla comes out on the finish.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Shows the firm tannins of this mountain appellation, and also ripe, concentrated blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate fruit. Easy to drink now for its rich appeal, but should age well for six years or so.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Rustic aromas of blackberry, leather, pepper, dried violet and a light tar show on the nose of this appellation-blend bottling. Cocoa and dark elderberry appear on the sip, along with dried herb. It's a light style of Syrah, but vibrant and versatile.",US-California-Syrah

"In this collaboration between Ken Forrester and Jesse Katz, Katz sources from the same site he favors for his Devil Proof Malbec, crafting here a creamy, decadent Cabernet stuffed in coconut macaroon, blueberry and black cherry fruit.

"You really can't beat the beauty of this Barolo. Rich, enduring and persistent, it offers a long array of blackberry, spice and cola-like aromas.

Give this 10–15 more years of aging.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"Enticing aromas of freshly cut Cox Orange Pippin apples reach every corner of this easy, fruity wine. The palate is crisp yet full flavored, light-bodied and dry. The finish is lasting and superclean.",France-Alsace-Alsace white blend
"Hard to believe the price on this. Yes, it's a perfectly good aged Ribera, but special it isn't. Bricky and roasted on the nose, with spiced cherry and plum aromas. The palate is healthy and comfortable, with cola, cherry and licorice flavors. Vanilla and length define the finish. Too regular to recommend at $325.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo

"Available in magnum only, this is an occasional bottling from the winery. A winery spokeperson told me my bottle was entirely 1993 vintage, but not all other bottles are. The wine is extraordinarily fine, but compared to other California bubblies, it's sandpapery and almost harsh at this point. As it warms up in the glass it shows an immense toasted nut and grilled fruit richness with an impossibly long finish. This is one to stash for the long haul.",US-California-Sparkling Blend

"Heavy wafts of petrol and oak dominate at first in this wine, before some air and some swirling in the glass reveal more lifted aromas and flavors of lemon candy, green apple and apple tart.

"With vines on the Montagne de Reims, this producer has a good line in Pinot Noir, which forms 85% of the blend. The wine is rich while well balanced and ripe. Now with just the right amount of bottle aging, it is full in the mouth, showing attractive apple and ripe pear flavors. The aftertaste is soft and fresh.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend

"Black-cherry and plum aromas on the nose open to similar flavors, with toast and mineral accents on the palate. An elegant and refined wine, with a lengthy finish that displays cassis and earth flavors, and moderate, even tannins. Not a heavy or fat wine, it shows very good balance and should be cellared for three to five years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"The Central Coast's Rhône pioneers deliver a savory style as usual, with scents of tobacco and creosote at the core, with red and blue fruit on the edges. It is dense and tannic on the palate with blueberry and blackberry fruits that are refreshed with acidity and lifted with mocha and mint spices.",US-California-Mourvèdre
"A simple Merlot, thin and dry, whose cherry and red plum flavors are compromised by green, unripe notes.",US-California-Merlot

"This rich, deliciously fruity wine combines structure and ripe layers of yellow fruits. Full in the mouth, it has a textured, spicy edge over the juicy acidity and fruitiness. It is ready to drink, but with its tight texture is likely to age well, so better to wait until 2017.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"Ultra-rich, with chocolate-infused dark berry flavors, splashed with cassis and accented with smoky new oak. Although the wine, which is 100% Cabernet, is totally dry, it's soft, which accentuates the alcohol, making it taste a bit hot and unbalanced.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Archery Summit wines often seem bigger-boned, oakier and more tannic than their brethren, and this bottling is no exception.

"Cinnamon is prominent on the nose of this wine, while bright berry, cherry, black olive and floral notes linger in the background.

"Soft and sweet in fruity extract and glycerols, and very high in alcohol, this Syrah is almost a dessert wine. There's no denying the flavors of blackberries, currants, sweet oak and chocolate are impressive, yet the wine needs greater dryness and structure.",US-California-Syrah

"Big, bold, brawny yet strangely elegant, this Zin holds plenty of appeal. The vineyard is 96 years old, giving the wine unusual concentration and complexity.

"Tannins form a dark barrier to start this wine. It is still young, dense with chocolate as well as fruit flavors, showing the bitter, tough flavors that come from too much extraction.

"The aromas of vanilla, herb and cherry show some volatility. The cherry flavors are light, finishing tart.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The name refers to the rocks in this section of the estate vineyard, and they can be felt as well as tasted in the wine.

All in all it's the most complex and intriguing of the winery's offerings, and merits your full attention.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"Nice and dry, with citrus flavors backed up with bright acidity that gets your tastebuds whistling. It's a wine that calls for goat cheese, grilled veggies, sourdough baguettes, fried chicken, cold cuts and fresh fruit. In other words, a picnic.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"A thin, sharp attack pushes subdued flavors of stem, cherry and chocolate into a quick, tight finish. In some ways, this wine recalls the Eyrie releases of decades ago, and may prove to age well, as many of those wines did. For now, it's a hard stemmy wine with a bit of burn.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This is a ripe, impressively rich wine. With dense tannins, spice and layers of black fruits it is concentrated, wearing its high alcohol easily. It comes from one of the home estates of Casa Santos Lima in the heart of the Lisboa region. Drink this wine from 2018.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese Red

"A very pretty Merlot, and a good price for the elegant quality. It's dry and tannic, showing the Clos du Val style of controlled, somewhat aloof ripeness. There's a rich, attractive core of black cherry fruit. Will develop for a few years, but it's really best now, with a brief decant.",US-California-Merlot

This wine is perfumed with geranium aromas and rhubarb flavors. It is strange and not likely to improve.,Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red

"Emphatically toasty and charred on the nose, this offers chocolate and hickory aromas. It feels smooth, plush, layered and not at all simple, with baked black-fruit flavors that are draped over savory barbecue and spice accents.

"Big and dry, this wine shows the tannic, firm character of the vintage. It has a dark, dense core of wood tannins while the juicy black currant fruit is still developing. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The more winemaker Chris Upchurch ups the percentage of Mourvèdre, the more delicious this wine becomes. Now at 50%, it adds a welcome touch of wildness, a hint of garrigue and a whiff of the barnyard. Raspberry, strawberry and cherry fruits, with some wild plum also, lead into a finish with allspice, cinnamon and bacon fat.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This inky and opaque Chianti Classico is made in an international style, offering intense oak and vanilla aromas. The palate shows overripe plum, espresso and green bell pepper flavors. While it starts off plush, it has short length with a drying, tannic finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Crisp red cherry and berry notes on the nose become increasingly ruddy and ripe on the palate of this soft, medium-bodied Merlot. It's pleasantly juicy, but whiffs of ramp and dried savory herbs are a distracting contrast.",US-New York-Merlot
"This wine is frankly high in alcohol, clocking in at 16% by volume. But it's also incredibly delicious, offering soft waves of milk chocolate, black cherry jam, red currants, bacon and black pepper. Drink this wine at night, with rich stews or barbecue, but be careful about driving.",US-California-Grenache-Syrah
"This Pinot certainly has lots of concentrated fruit, with an intensity of cherry and raspberry jam, pomegranates and cola. It's also well oaked, to judge from the strong layer of buttered cinnamon toast. Feels strong and indelicate now, with a punch of acidity, but could mellow over the next 2–3 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This opens with aromas suggesting white flower, orchard fruit and bread crust. The straightforward palate delivers Golden Delicious apple and a hint of peach alongside crisp acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Chardonnay
"Woodspice, herb and dark fruit aromas are out in front. The flavors show a lot of barrel influence, with the tannins providing some grit.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Good cherry, red currant and oak flavors in this Pinot, which is totally dry. But it's very acidic, with a scoury mouthfeel, and doesn't seem like it's going anywhere.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Here's a simple, brambly expression of Sangiovese Grosso, with bright acidity and lively notes of forest berry and moist earth. This wine has a smoky touch of toasted almond on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Black cherry, chipped slate and cola notes lavish the nose on this top-end bottling of best barrels from the single-vineyard specialist. The palate offers much more depth, with ripe alpine strawberry, black plum skins and blackberry fruit, all seasoned by crushed nutmeg and shaved juniper.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a distinctly simple Chardonnay. It's marked by pineapple, pear and peach flavors. Will satisfy America's basic Chardonnay craving.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A blend of Cabernet Franc and Pinot Noir, this pale pink rosé has really fresh acidity and crisp apple fruits. There are just hints of red-berry fruits and a touch of tannin that gives the wine an edge of dryness. The aftertaste, with the creamy mousse, is fresh and lively.",France-Loire Valley-Sparkling Blend
"Give this dry, elegant Pinot a couple of years to let all the parts knit together. Right now, the oak stands out, and the acidity seems out of balance with the rich raspberry and persimmon fruit. It's a remarkably complex wine, however, and should be even better by 2016.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This captivating wine, from vines dating back to the early 1970s, will reward your patience. It must be decanted if you want it to burst open past the initial tart flavors of green apple and grapefruit. Once it does, it will delight with juicy citrus, ample acidity, and plenty of grip.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"A full spectrum of Chilean SB aromas are present, from grass to citrus to tropical fruits to vegetal notes. This feels fresh but more or less regular. Flavors of green fruits come with grassy interjections, while the finish is good and clean.",Chile-San Antonio-Sauvignon Blanc
"A testament of Bellangelo's increasing winemaking prowess, this Cabernet Franc highlights fresh floral exuberance amidst a crush of concentrated sour cherry and cranberry flavors. While delicate in style and fringed by a whisper of tannins, its brambly, herbaceous complexities resonate through a long, meandering finish.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"Named for the clone so beloved by winemakers, this white is sourced from two estate vineyards. It opens in confectionary aromas that lead into a full-bodied style that's lushly voluptuous and exotic, yet completely in balance, a celebration of lemon curd, nutmeg and tarte Tatin.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Pretty full-bodied for a rosé, with a copper-pink color and upfront red currant, raspberry cream, vanilla and cinnamon flavors that finish a little sweet. The acidity is just fine. Nice with charcuterie.",US-California-Rosé
"This starts with dense, murky, earthy aromas of stewed black fruits and rubber. In the mouth, it feels full and aggressive, with rubbery tannins supporting thick, herbal flavors of rooty black fruits. A chunky, chewy, layered finish is generous in every way.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley-Syrah
"This wine is thick, rich, ripe and full-throttled. Extremely opaque in color, it's intriguingly tasty in its waves of blackberry jam, spicy cinnamon and black pepper. Leathery on the palate, it imparts a faint hint of dried herb.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A good, everyday Cabernet marked by attractive blackberry, cherry, currant and oak flavors. It's dry and the tannins are rich and supple.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Beef jerky, dried mushrooms, black pepper, pencil lead, black olive and elderberry swirl into a memorable nose on this wine by professorial vintner Wes Hagen. It's incredibly alive on the palate, delivering soy and deeply tart cranberry-cherry juice flavors, and needs until late 2015 to emerge as an even more solid sipper.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Barrel notes of toast, butterscotch and spice are at the fore along with melted butter and peach on this 100% Canyon Vineyard Ranch wine. It's full bodied with a rich, creamy feel, wanting a bit more concentration and acidity to keep it together.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Tight grass aromas give way to passionfruit, lemongrass and nectarine, with a touch of sweetness on the nose of this wine. That sweetness vanishes when sipped, yielding a bone-dry, tightly wound wine offering more grass flavors and a steely acidity.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Toast, espresso, oak and grilled sage aromas lead the way while the firm palate delivers ripe raspberry, fleshy cherry, powdered sage and star anise. Astringent tannins provide support but also dry out the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Lavish freesia and honeysuckle perfume persists throughout this bristling, bright Riesling. It's delicate and spry in mouthfeel, but rich, round swirls of tropical fruit penetrate deeply on the palate. It's irresistably unabashedly forward and fruity.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Pale in color and light in body, this simple Pinot has a gassy, bubblegummy taste, with a raspberry sweetness. It's almost like a minor Beaujolais.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a smooth and gently fruity wine. Aromas are subtle, fresh and slightly floral, while the more-forward flavors resemble peaches and honeydew melons. The texture is smooth rather than tart, and the wine may have a touch of residual sugar to keep it tasting fruity and feeling rounded.",US-California-Riesling
"Dusty and detailed, this pure Viognier incorporates notes of lemon-pepper; tart, fresh lemon pulp and rind; plus a hint of curry powder. This should make an interesting accompaniment to raw clams or oysters.",US-Washington-Viognier
"Floral, oily aromas are not typical of Chardonnay. A plump, melony mouthfeel is chunky, while this wine tastes both tropical and bitter, with a bath-soap character.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"This is spicy, with a dry, dusty character that's laid over the blackberry fruit. It is full on the palate, almost sweet in character, showing a soft, warm finish.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Light-bodied and refreshing, this wine leads with fresh cucumber aromas then opens crisp grapefruit and lemon flavors that feel lively on the palate.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Ripe dark-skinned berry, underbrush, new oak, vanilla leather, sage and cured meat aromas meld in the glass. The full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, raisin, fig, licorice and exotic spice alongside velvety tannins.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"This is a rich opulent wine. Its red-berry fruits are just the starting point for a series of layers of fruit, tannins and intense perfumed ripeness. The wine is firm at this young stage with great potential to develop into a generous wine as it matures. It comes from vines at the northern end of the Beaune premier crus. Drink from 2024.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"A likable, easy to drink wine, totally dry and brisk in acidity, with low alcohol. It has savory flavors of lemons, limes, oranges and spices.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"This 100% Riesling shows just a touch of residual sugar, with flavors of light lemon, orange pekoe tea and candied papaya fruit. It has unusual body for a Riesling.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Peppery and beefy in aroma, this wine is heavy on the savory components and rather lean on fruit flavors.",US-California-Barbera
"From the Murgia Tarantina high plains of the Salento in the deep south of Italy, this thinly-composed Fiano-based sparkling wine opens with oddly matched aromas of lemon curd, yeast and toasted hazelnut.",Italy-Southern Italy-Fiano
"Dark and thick in the glass, this blend of 82% Syrah and 18% Mourvèdre leads with black cherry syrup, smoked beef and dark chocolate aromas, which blossom as the wine opens. Rich and lavish on the palate, it has fine tannins that frame its blueberry, cassis and mocha flavors. It's firmly structured, with a lingering acidity.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"The style can only be called “nouveau” as the soft, forward, very grapey aromas are followed by tart, lightly spicy cranberry fruit and a quick, light finish. —P.G.",US-Washington-Sangiovese
"Aromas of ripe blackberry, anisette, black pepper and scorched earth lead the nose. On the tight palate, notes of licorice, espresso, leather and clove accent a core of dried black cherry and fig.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"Notes of olive, herbs, flowers, orange peel, gravel, meat, coffee and light barrel spices leap up on a wine that shows a lot of aromatic complexity. The fruit and savory flavors are plush and full in feel followed by a lingering finish. There's a whole lot of wine delivered for this price.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This is 95% Cabernet Sauvignon from the estate vineyards. Quite sour with lip-puckering cherry fruit, it thins out and finishes with hard, slightly chalky tannins.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Do not pop the cork and drink this right away as it's currently tight and tannic. But as it warms up and breathes, it releases its considerable charms. With 16% Viognier blended in, it's fantastically rich and concentrated in black-pepper-accented raspberry and sweet-smoke flavors. Acidity adds balance to the richness. You can enjoy this wine now, after an hour in the decanter, or cellar it for at least six years.",US-California-Syrah
"This is the second vintage of this wine from the winery's young estate property. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, it's locked up at present with aromas of coffee, graphite, cherry, barrel spices and licorice. The dark chocolate and cherry flavors are tightly coiled and the lightly grippy tannins are wound up. There's lot of promise there but it needs time to be realized. It will be best after 2021.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"There are dark tannins here, although they are embedded in the ripe black fruits. This wine is solid and firm, the acidity giving the essential freshness. The fruitiness and the plush texture are taking their time to show. Drink from 2020.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"A quite remarkable mauve-pink in color, this offers faint cherry aromas. It's nearly sweet on the palate, with strawberries and hard red berry candy flavors.",US-California-Zinfandel
"The nose is rather neutral save for distant aromas of cherry fruit, boysenberry and spice. However, the mouthfeel is more interesting thanks to the wine's chewy succulence and fresh, zesty close: An 80-20 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Fresh stony apple and citrus aromas are composed. Following that lead, this feels focused and fresh. Flavors of stone fruits, citrus fruits and white pepper finish crisp but not real long or deep.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Previous vintages tasted more balanced than this super-oaky one. The wood erupts from the glass, suggestive of caramel, buttered popcorn, vanilla cream pie and charcoal, overwhelming what seems to be a perfectly nice wine. Some folks will love it. Others will find it the poster child of overoaked California Chard.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Hickory is the lead aroma, followed by notes of leather, earthy berry and spice. It feels juicy, lively and traditional, with a fine body-to-acid ratio. This offers classic Rioja flavors of red fruit, tomato, tobacco, dill and vanilla, with a long, consistent finish. It's healthy and drinkable now through 2017.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Delicate notes of nettle and lemon play on the restrained nose. The palate adds slight but very refreshing spritz to the already slender and crisp body. This is an easy, delicate summer wine with a clean and refreshing finish.",Austria-Burgenland-Sauvignon Blanc
"Rounded and likable, this is a bang-up deal for a wine of fine quality, textured, light and fruity in stone fruit and pineapple.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Comedìa is a blend of Sangiovese (50%), Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot that delivers immediate aromas of spice, toasted almond and cherry fruit. It shows crisp, fresh acidity and an easy mouthfeel that would pair well with aged pecorino cheese.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"The big, very dark and inviting nose of ripe cherry, licorice, cocoa and toast sets things up. The dense palate is packed with cherry, tar, even bacon notes, and it has a plush, velvety feel that belies the wine's structure. The impressive finish is dark and toasty, with well-dispersed tannins. Cellar two to four years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Erupts out from the glass with beautiful Cabernet perfume, suggesting cherry pie from the oven, licorice, sandalwood and dusty dried herbs, like sage and thyme. Very dry, with a long spicy finish, but also quite tannic, although lots of the tannins come from new oak. Best to age this polished 100% Cab for at least six years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A beautiful wine that tastes much richer than you usually get for this price. Shows gorgeously ripe blackberry, cherry, currant, mocha, licorice, bacon and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into refined tannins and finishing long and spicy. A blend of Syrah, Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon.",US-California-Red Blend
"Fresh and fruity aromas and flavors make this medium-bodied wine easy to enjoy. It has an earthy smell at first, but that blows off quickly. The mouthfeel is smooth, almost sweet. .",US-California-Merlot
"This straightforward Barolo offers aromas of pressed rose petal, red berry, truffle and a whiff of leather. The round palate displays Morello cherry, menthol, chopped mint, ground pepper and anise accompanied by smooth, polished tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"In a word: stately. The wine starts with cedar, leather and olive aromas, followed by complex flavors of cinnamon, red fruit and a touch of spicy smoke. This wine will age well but is delicious now.",Greece-Nemea-Agiorgitiko
"Opens with an appealing bouquet of dark cherry and chocolate, cedar and leather accents. In the mouth simple berry flavors sporting wood and leather accents take over. Finishes with tart cherry notes and moderate length.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Heady plum and dark berry aromas give a warning of size and ripeness, and indeed there's a ton of ripe fruit to the palate; but the wine is also raw, untamed and lacking in mouthfeel. It could stand to flow and finish better than it does.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"For what's supposed to be an upper-level wine, this is prickly and clipped. The nose is herbal and spicy, with limited red-fruit notes. The palate is driven by racy acids and peppery, herbal flavors on top of tart red plum. Overall there's not much fruit to this crisp sizzler.",Chile-Rapel Valley-Carmenère
"This basic, intensely ripe wine shows less fruit and acidity than toasty spice and oak. Fruit is sourced from Sangiacomo Vineyards and the wine fermented in both barrels and stainless steel.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Initial gaseous, rubbery aromas subside with time in the glass. This remains minty and herbal on the nose, while olive, eucalyptus and red-fruit flavors carry the palate to a firm, solid-feeling, minty and lightly green finish.",Chile-Rapel Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Deep but not showy aromas of velvety lilacs, concentrated blackberry and river rocks pop on the nose of this blend of 42% Syrah, 37% Grenache, 14% Mourvèdre and 7% Counoise. Rounded purple-fruit flavors mesh with a silky, earthy texture on the palate, with olallieberry, caramel and a slow rising acidity.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This wine all comes Chandler Reach Vineyards. The aromas seem to lack clarity while the cranberry, prune and cherry flavors want for midpalate concentration.",US-Washington-Merlot
"This crisp, acidic Sauvignon Blanc leans green with pea and canned bean aromas, but it offers enough green apple and citrus character for enjoyment. The palate is zesty and lemony, with flavors that include green veggies, herbs, limes and tangerines. The finish is mildly green and citrusy.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Edgy cherry and currant aromas are more crisp than rich, while this old-vines Rioja also shows an aromatic note of dusty earth. High acidity tethered to a medium body creates some midpalate emptiness, while plum, currant and berry flavors are fresh on a pointy finish. Drink through 2024.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This deeply colored and solidly built wine smells like black olives, dried plums and cedar, while tasting concentrated and ripe, with a polished texture. This will pair well with a rich dish like osso buco.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dry, tart in acidity and vegetal, this Sauvignon Blanc isn't ripe. It tastes like green beans with just a hint of citrus.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Here is a straight shooting and easy expression of Brunello with cherry, leather, tobacco and more dark fruit at the back. The wine is very fine and smooth, but ultimately less complex than other vintages.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Structured with green plums and currants, this delicious, limpid wine envelops the palate with citrus and pure, crisp fruit flavors. A great expression of terroir-driven Riesling, with a mineral and steely structure to support the fruit.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"This is a juicy fruity wine with tannins that are already subdued by the acidity and fruit. There is a dry core just set to support the black-currant fruit. With a bright crisp aftertaste, the wine will mature quickly. Drink from 2017.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"This generous smooth wine is packed with ripe tannins and vibrant red fruits. There is the typical mineral texture of many Dão wines along with solid spice and dark chocolate flavors from wood aging. This is an impressive wine that deserves to age further, so drink from 2019.",Portugal-Dão-Portuguese Red
The wine is very fresh and fruity with lively red-berry flavors balanced delicately with light tannins and acidity. It's refreshing with a red currant aftertaste.,France-Provence-Rhône-style Red Blend
"It's unclear why this wine's bottle has to be so heavy. After all, the wine inside is ripe, fruity and very ready to drink, certainly not for aging. Black fruits have matured into a leather texture and smoky flavors. The wine is ripe and full in the mouth with just a touch of pepper at the end from alcohol. Drink now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Solid but generic berry fruit aromas are clean and come with herbal, minty edging. There's no shortage of acidity, so the palate has a sharp, crisp feel and tart, oaky flavors of berry and plum. Sheer, hard, tart and dry on the finish.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Syrah
"A 50-50 blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah, this offers inviting aromas of ripe black plum, fragrant blue flower and allspice. Blackberry, dried cherry and black pepper take center stage on the palate, while soft tannins provide light support. It finishes on a smoky note.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"La Chablisienne vinifies this portion of Fourchaume premier cru separately, regarding it as almost grand cru in power. It is certainly a concentrated wine, very ripe, but lined with citrus acidity, crispness and structure. At the end, though, the richness comes out.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Definitely wood-aged, this seriously toasty wine seems to have lost its fruit along the way. It gives a hard and tough character that is partly redeemed by juicy acidity at the end.",France-Alsace-Pinot Noir
This spicy wine offers peppery strawberry flavors and plenty of citrusy acids. It's still a little disjointed and could benefit from additional bottle age.,US-Washington-Sangiovese
"This standard Verdejo is light on acidity, which is reflective of a hot year. Its citrus and green herb notes are fresh and prickly while its melon and thyme flavors lose intensity on the slightly bitter finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"This blend of Rolle and Ugni Blanc, typical of Provence whites, is smooth, ripe and only lightly textured. The Rolle (Vermentino) that dominates gives an attractive perfumed character as well as a mineral texture and acidity. Drink now.",France-Provence-Provence white blend
"Coming from a blend of fruit from the Walla Walla Valley, Red Mountain and Yakima Valley appellations, this wine opens with high-toned aromas of spice box, dark cherry, earth, tobacco and herb. The flavors are full and tightly coiled, with lightly grained tannins giving support. At times it seems a bit dried out.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A gold color and honey aromas set the scene for this rich, opulent wine. It has a great layer of botrytis as well as plenty of spice and delicious apricot and orange fruit flavors, finishing with a tang of crisp acidity. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This is a balanced, fruity wine with a beautiful line of fragrant acidity. Apples, pears and a touch of chewy tannin all work together well to give a wine that is both firmly textured and fresh with fruit. It could be drunk now, although it will be best from 2016.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Closed and muted on the nose at first, this wine shows varietal scents that include blue and red berry fruit and dried sage. Softly textured, it's an approachable middle-of-the-road Syrah.",US-California-Syrah
"This is a 100% varietal wine, with fruit sourced from Sonoma Mountain as well as Dry Creek and Alexander valleys. Black fruit wraps around generous tannin and oak as a touch of cola spice attempts to liven things up on the palate.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A strongly perfumed wine, this is soft and just off-dry in character with some sucrosity. Crisp, fresh berry fruits are laced with acidity and finished with orange zest.",France-France Other-Rosé
"Truffle, leather, Mediterranean brush, chopped herb and black-skinned fruit aromas meld together with a balsamic note. The juicy, concentrated palate shows dried cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and licorice while fine-grained tannins lend support. Give it time for the tannins to fully integrate. Drink 2020–2030.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Leafy underbrush, truffle, woodland berry and toast aromas lead the nose. The chewy, solid palate offers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, grilled sage and ground aniseed alongside bracing tannins and assertive acidity. Drink 2018–2028.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Cool mineral tones and citrus acidity collide on the palate of this dry Riesling like a glaze of tangerine sherbet. It's an invigorating, zippy wine but finishes with steel-edged force and persistence. Drink now through 2021.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Gooseberry and hop aromas are atypical for a Chardonnay, yet they surprisingly meld well with vanilla biscuit and peach tones. The medium-bodied palate brings lemon curd and brûléed peach flavors that carry to a vanilla-cream finish. Snappy acidity—presumably from the addition of 7% Petit Manseng—keeps the palate lively and in check.",US-Virginia-Chardonnay
"Open and simple, this has a light touch of citrus fruit, with an edge of wood in the background. It is bright and ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Hot and fiery up front, with raspberry and leather on the nose. Feels astringent, with tomatoey acidity and pointed cherry flavors that come with an herbal, peppery aftertaste. Has an aggressiveness to it.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir
"This mature expression of Sauvignon opens with bright aromas of peach, honey, apricot and passion fruit. The mouthfeel is less intense with a lean, but crisp finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon Blanc
"This might be one of Oregon's best Cabernet efforts to date. Yes, it's firm, with hard tannins, but time should allow that to settle down. In the meantime, there's char, road tar and caramel on the nose, while plum, cassis and chocolate dominate the rich, extracted palate. Toward the end it's the tannic structure that makes itself most felt. But again, some time in the cellar is probably all it requires.",US-Oregon-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Golden color and hints of oatmeal on the nose signal some evolution. The palate rewards this notion with rounded harmony: there is the merest touch of dark honey to the autolytic notes of wholemeal biscuit. Rounded lemony freshness stirs through everything and is dispersed with all of the tiny bubbles bursting. Lovely, resonant, very integrated and lasting.",England-England-Sparkling Blend
"This is the midlevel entry in Yalumba's Shiraz-Viognier range, slotting in above the Y Series but below the Hand Picked. It's a medium-bodied, slightly creamy-textured wine, with prominent green olive and peppercorn nuances to its plummy flavors. It fades a little on the finish, so drink now–2013.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz-Viognier
"Aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit, spice rack, grilled herb and a whiff of leather lead the nose of this blend of 85% Sangiovese, with 15% Colorino, Canaiolo and Merlot. The taut palate offers dried black cherry, espresso, aniseed and tobacco alongside bracing tannins that leave an astringent finish. Even though the tannins need to unwind, drink sooner rather than later to enjoy the remaining fruit richness.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Peppery and hot, with blackberry and currant flavors wrapped into firm tannins. Not showing much openness now, but feels like it has the potential to develop with a few years in the bottle.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A jumbled mix of aromas includes notes of rubber, berry fruits, plum, grass, fennel and oak. In the mouth, this is full and blocky. Rubbery flavors of plum and berry finish salty, savory and spicy, with unintegrated oak that stands out.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir
"With only 30 cases imported, this might be a tough find, but it's a great Terrasses du Larzac at an attractive price. Rich and concentrated dark fruit flavors of plum, cherry and boysenberry are infused with notes of chicory and herbal bark. The lush and creamy texture fills the palate, with a vanilla custard richness and a baking spice-flavored finish.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Earthy aromas lead to a palate that is full bodied, with notes of yeast and spice to go with the white fruit. It has attractive acidity and a tangy citrusy finish. Screwcap.",France-Provence-White Blend
"This young Chardonnay packs an overpowering array of scents and flavors, and it may get better if they mellow over time. The nose offers grapefruit, guava and vanilla, while the palate is dominated by canned pears.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Tones of leather, tobacco and wild mushroom are followed by accents of ripe fruit and blackberry preserves. Notes of rum cake, licorice and Indian spice give complexity to this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Fully mature, oxidized aromas include a heavy note of popcorn and oak along with aged pear and apple. This wine is ripping with acidity, while flavors lean towards salty, lightly baked apple. A finish based mostly on acid means this should stay vital for years to come.",Spain-Catalonia-White Blend
"Juicy, sweet and fat in glycerine, this has complex flavors of blackberry and cherry pie filling. The tannins and acids give it a fine, elegant structure. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The nose on this Albariño deals tropical fruit and vanilla scents. It feels citrusy, with modest flavors of papaya, peach and white melon. After showing moderate vitality on the palate, the finish softens up and slips into the netherworld. Seems as though it's beginning to fade.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Light in color and body, this is a silky Pinot Noir for everyday fare. It shows cola, cherry jam, persimmon and Asian spice flavors, with a coating of toasty oak.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Slightly confected on the nose, showing cotton candy and bubble gum aromas, but you'll also find plenty of strawberry-raspberry flavors. Very fruity and clean, with a fresh finish.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This wine is raisiny on the front end, heavy and prune-driven in the middle, and even more raisiny on the finish. Overripe in style with 60% Garnacha and 40% Tempranillo.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"High-toned acidity provides a backbone of structure amid the otherwise luscious profile of this wine that's delightfully light and bright in pomegranate, black cherry and spicy citrus. Deliciously juicy and textured on the palate, it finishes with a touch of tobacco and black tea.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"An interesting and even somewhat eccentric wine. There are notes of green tea and herbs, but enough pure orange fruit to make it rich. Lots of zingy acidity, too.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Red rose, woodland berry and ground spice aromas lead the way on this expressive, delightful red. The vibrant palate offers juicy morello cherry, crushed raspberry and white pepper framed in zesty acidity and silky, smooth tannins. It's incredibly easy to drink.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Frappato
"Give this Pinot  Noir a couple of years to knit together. Right now it's a little acidic, and it offers flavors of Life Savers candy, raspberry and cherry. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Blended with 17% Cabernet Sauvignon and aged for 28 months in French oak, this broad-shouldered red is powerfully concentrated and tightly wound. Raisin cake, cigar box and baked plum play nicely together within an intense texture of leathery spice.",US-California-Merlot
"The concept here is a southern Rhône blend—47% Syrah, 17% Grenache, 19% Cinsault and 17% Mourvèdre. With the extra dollop of Syrah, it's got more substance than the usual Châteauneuf wannabes. Spicy and sharp, this benefits from the fact that the grapes all came in at once and were co-fermented, so the blend married early and well. Despite its youth, this is seamless and focused; a complete and very successful wine with berry, cherry and sweet plum fruit flavors annotated with spice and bits of chocolate. Elegant, feminine and supple, this is a lovely bottle.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Soft and sweetly simple, with sugary flavors of canned oranges and pears and butter-sautéed bananas.",US-California-Muscat Canelli

"Dark and full-bodied for a rosé, with heavy-handed flavors of raspberry jam and toast that have a vegetal edge.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Bricco delle Viole has a thorny, slightly nervous personality that needs a few more years of cellar aging before softening. Aromas include dill, dried herbs, turmeric, forest berry and bramble. The mouthfeel is sharp and polished with bright berry nuances and crisp acidity. Drink this wine with cream- or butter-based dishes.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Rich, velvety and intense, this is packed with gorgeous mulberry and spice aromas and flavors, with intriguing hints of tar and espresso.

"This wine is entirely Cabernet, using grapes from the southerly Coombsville area and warmer St. Helena. As such, it's wonderfully balanced, with a sprightly burst of acidity brightening succulent flavors of black cherry and dark chocolate. The use of 100% new French oak sounds excessive on paper, but it's perfectly integrated, providing a jacket of sweet buttered toast that in no way overshadows the fruit. Enjoy it now and over the next 10 years as it ages.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Vanilla, cedar and caramel abound on the nose of this opulent reserve Cabernet Franc. Its unabashed oakiness integrates well into the palate though, adding a sexy, spicy tone to ripe black berry and plum flavors. It's bold, concentrated and a bit brawny, but irresistibly so, finishing with remarkable depth and persistence. Hold till 2020 to allow its brawn to settle.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"Stone, lime salt and lemon zest pique the entry of this medium-bodied white, which is well-integrated in terms of oak. High in citrus flavor and pear, it has a gritty texture that gives it added complexity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"From a 1,350-acre family estate divided among five chateaus, this crisp wine is packed with red fruits cut with citrus acidity. Refreshing and mineral textured, it will make a fine apéritif.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Classic flavors, great structure and impressive depth make this wine tempting to drink now, but it will certainly improve with age. Hints of light nutmeg and coriander mingle with stronger blackberry and black pepper in the aromas and flavors. It has that slightly wild, gamey character of the Rhône, along with ripe but slightly restrained fruit and spices. Best from 2018 to 2023.",US-California-Syrah

"Sourced from 50-year-old vines, Bosco del Falco shows inky concentration, with dusty mineral shadings of slate, crushed granite and earth. The fruits are prune and dried berry, and the wine features tight tannins and overall complexity. Drink now, or age for five more years.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"This Cabernet isn't particularly Rutherford-esque due to excessive softness and fruitiness. It could come from almost anywhere, with its raspberry and cherry jam, milk chocolate and toast flavors.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
Delicate scents of white spring flower and orchard fruit lead the nose while the fresh light-bodied palate offers suggestions of yellow peach and apple. It closes crisp and clean.,Italy-Northeastern Italy-Ribolla Gialla
"Soft aromatic notions of red cherry and blueberry, along with white pepper, rise from the glass. The palate brims with tart crunchy ripe fruit and emphasizes blueberry. There is a light touch here and lovely fluidity—the tannins are like starched velvet. This is refreshing and very elegant. It's neither light nor heavy, but just right and medium bodied, perfect for subtle cuisine.",Austria-Burgenland-Blaufränkisch
"Liquid smoke and toasted elements of roasted hazelnut and cured meat dominate the nose of this modern Barbera d'Alba. There is power and high alcohol here too, coupled by the wine's naturally high acidity that is a bit strong on the palate. Pair this wine with very cheesey foods.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"For a 2008, this seems to be developing rather quickly, showing toasty notes that emerge on the nose, expand on the palate and jump out on the finish, largely overshadowing the admirable citrus and crushed-stone elements. Drink now.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling

"Part of a range of young wines produced by Mas del Perié. This is bright and fruity, relying on black berry fruits, soft tannins and a vivid juicy character. The dusty tannins supply a light amount of structure.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Aromas of dark berry, mineral, blue flower and leather come together in the glass. The structured palate offers black cherry, coffee, oak, licorice and grilled Mediterranean herb alongside assertive tannins that need to unwind. It ends on a mineral note. Drink 2017–2025.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend

"The deep gold-brown color hints that this will be something unusual. Made in an overtly oaky style, this smells toasty and buttery and tastes like that too. Some will love it but more fruit flavor would balance out the apparently heavy winemaking inputs.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This rosé is very Provencal in expression, with restrained aromas of orange mousse, nectarine, rose petals and wet cement on the nose. The palate is clean and crisp with a rainy concrete-like grip, showing slightly sour citrus and a twist of stone fruit on the sip.",US-California-Mourvèdre
"Almond, toast, vanilla bean and other oak-related aromas drive the nose of this vibrant Riserva from one of the most beautiful estates in Radda-in-Chianti.

"Baked plum, underripe raspberry and cola aromas meet with roasted meats, strong fennel, composting flowers and pencil shavings on the complex nose of this appellation blend. The palate is just as hearty, with thyme, anise, marjoram and Indian spice giving depth to the rounded cranberry base. Bitter orange rind and tangy green-olive touches push it even deeper.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"The nose here is not quite as clean-cut as it could be, while the palate shows a little more focus. Crisp and zesty, if a little short.",Austria-Carnuntum-Grüner Veltliner

"Generic and monotone on the nose. The palate is nothing more than wet and chunky, while the flavors are soft, sweet and candied, with vanilla and toffee overriding any fruit. A creamy dullard with a lot of vanilla and hardly any pulse.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay

"The nose just hints at earth and autumnal oak leaf. The palate comes with slight grip, very fine tannins and more earthy leafy aromas. Red-cherry fruit is just hinted at. This is slender and bone dry and will come into its own when served with subtle mushroom or game dishes.",France-Alsace-Pinot Noir
"Fat, fleshy and opulent, a Marilyn Monroe type of wine with enough curves to dazzle. Appeals immediately for its rich, saturated blackberry and cherry flavors, wrapped into soft, velvety tannins. There's an inherent firmness that should allow this Cabernet to age gracefully into middle age.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The trick with growing Syrah in the Highlands is hitting the sweet spot between ripeness and its opposite. This bottling certainly achieves very fruity black currant, dark chocolate, pepper and root beer flavors that are delicious. It has a sharpness throughout that detracts from the lush feeling, but that sharpness may go away with some time in the bottle.",US-California-Syrah
"Cola and soft red raspberry scents show on the nose of this blend of 58% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre, 17% Syrah. It's easy-drinking and simple, with red fruit, white pepper and asphalt hints. A great, light, quaffable red for a warm day.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend

"This big, ripe wine wraps intense and delicious fruit flavors in a plush but tannic texture, and does it so well that it's hard to put down the glass.

"All stainless-fermented and aged, this deserves to be on your short list of can't-miss choices in a domestic Chardonnay.

There's a seam of wintergreen running alongside in this new vintage, leaving your mouth feeling scrubbed clean.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Deep berry, cinnamon, briar and mint aromas. Firm, even backwards, it is trim and elegant, yet solid. Black fruit and bitter-chocolate flavors abound. The finish is especially tight, with dry tannins and complex mineral and earth elements. Huge but refined, the quintessential iron fist in a velvet glove; it needs time.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This selection is fruity and refreshing, yet it has a full body and a ripe character. Taut and tangy on the finish, this wine can age for another 6–9 months to allow the structure to soften.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Picturesque with a crystalline salmon color, it begins with the scent of just-bitten nectarine. The following flavors of tart apple and a slightly bitter salinity ensure the uniqueness of this wine. Mourvèdre (57%) is in the lead, followed closely by Grenache (28%) and Counoise (15%), all coming from the original cuttings of the Château de Beaucastel.

"Notes of hazelnut and freshly baked brioche add depth and a sense of maturity to fresher aromas of apple and pear on this sparkling wine.

Finishes with a lingering hint of cookie crumbs.",US-New York-Champagne Blend
"Dry, tart and balanced, it has keen acidity highlighting complex flavors of pomegranates, persimmons, cherries and sandalwood, with the earthy, plummy sweetness of mu shu sauce. This wine gets better and better as it breathes in the glass. It's hard to keep from opening it now, but it will benefit from aging; best after 2018.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"While the nose discloses little, the palate displays an array of apricot, sharp arugula and white pepper with some grapefruit zest. Focused and streamlined, this wine delivers lip-smacking freshness, great concentration and a super-clean finish. Drink as of 2016.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner

From the textured, elegant, densely layered nose to the richly toasted flavors and the lingering, sensuous finish, it shows a confident touch with a continental flair.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend

"Very opulent, almost too much so, with a flood of Key lime pie, pineapple jam, orange, butterscotch and buttered toast flavors that overwhelm in richness. The saving grace is a fine structure of acidity and minerals and a finish that strives to be dry. Drink now with shellfish, roast pork, or all alone as an apéritif.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Wood aging has given this wine some roundness and softness without taking away from the intense grassy, grapefruit flavors of Sauvignon Blanc. It has good richness as well as taut fruitiness.",France-Bordeaux-Sauvignon Blanc

"A very nice wine, with good, ripe black-currant fruit; dry and balancedwith aromas and flavors of sweet, smoky oak. The flash is on the surface and it's a little sharp, so it's not an ager. But it's a tasty wine.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Simple berry aromas are generic. This is dark on the palate, with black-fruit flavors that are standard and don't show much character. A lightly toasted finish is solid and not too choppy.",Argentina-Other-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of gingerbread cookies with a black-cherry glaze meet black gravel and a touch of asphalt on the nose of this complex and flavorful bottling.

Against the black cherry and dark strawberry on the nose rise powerful crushed slate and smashed graphite aromas. The palate starts with cranberry and pomegranate, but the slate and rocky-soil flavors swing back in, giving backbone to the hints of bay leaf and herbs.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Although the residual sugar on this dessert Zin is a hefty 9%, it's unbalanced. Doesn't have the fruity concentration it needs, leaving it basically a melange of alcohol and sweetness.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A fuller-bodied, richer and denser style of Pinot Noir than many of the producer's other offerings, this one traffics in toasted oak and tannin before revealing dark cherry and leather. Generous, it finishes dry and with power. Cellar through 2022.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Hints of cut grass and passion fruit on the nose are followed by attractive tropical fruit and fresh herbs on the palate. This medium-bodied wine boasts a soft, rounded feel that turns slightly chalky on the finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Based around the 2013 vintage, this wine is young. Perfumed apple and pineapple fruits are tightly laced with lemon and crisp acidity. These contrast with the creamy mousse that adds a softer touch. Age this bottling until 2018.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"An oaky, full-bodied, warm-climate Chardonnay with long lingering flavors of vanilla and coconut, as well as ripe apple crisp.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Dusty, yeasty aromas of red apple skins, cherry and chocolate lead to a solid and true palate with a good bubble bead, moderate elegance and full flavors of plum, red apple, cherry and spice. This is full-bodied Cava with a smooth, robust finish.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Amarone usually delivers soft, smooth tannins but Capitel Monte Olmi, on the other hand, exhibits tight, astringent firmness followed by sweet, jammy fruit. Give this wine another five years to soften in the bottle.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Bold and pretty at the same time, this has oodles of crushed berry aromas. Ripe fruit flavors that recall black cherry and boysenberry come with hints of toasted oak and a silky smooth texture. It's full bodied but not too stiff or tannic, just concentrated and almost sweet in its richness.",US-California-Barbera
"Richly layered red fruit accents an explosion of firm lengthy tannin, alongside dashes of clove and cinnamon, in this hearty full-bodied red. Robust and concentrated, it shows oaky bursts of vanilla and smoke on the finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Good price for a crisp white wine that's this polished. Nice on its own for the savory citrus, spearmint and spicy vanilla flavors, and fine with everything from fried chicken to Cantonese.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"You'll want to give this wine a little time in the cellar, because it's all teenaged gawkiness now. There's lots of sweet, cherry pie flavor, sweet new oak, crisp acidity and rich, ripe tannins, but it hasn't all come together. Best after 2009, but not a longterm ager.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Made entirely from Nero d'Avola, this opens with black-skinned berry, freshly turned soil and cooking spice aromas. The soft, juicy palate offers blackberry, carob and clove flavors while rounded tannins lend a smooth texture. Enjoy through 2019.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"Opens with bell pepper and celery stalk aromas and then come raisin, roast plum and carob bean scents. The palate is a bit narrow and acidic, with baked berry and herbal flavors. Pretty standard and a touch green as a whole.",Chile-Maule Valley-Red Blend
"This is a crisp, 90% Pinot Noir-based wine with a light tannic edge from the red wine used to give color. It also has ripe red-berry fruits as well as acidity giving it dryness. It is fruity, steely and ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Made from a separate parcel of the Valandraud estate, this is a fruity, ripe wine. Dark tannins and flavors of dark chocolate combine with great fruit and acidity. It is still packed with tannins and will take plenty of time to come round. Drink from 2024.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A wine to remember for its spicy pepper scents and vibrantly fresh acidity, this is complex and layered, moderate in acidity yet amply juicy in blackberry and blueberry fruit. Hints of spice, sage and lavender linger impressively on the finish.",US-California-Syrah
"Deep color, firm tannins and a fine-grained texture set this wine apart. It smells fresh and sophisticated, with bright cranberry and rich black-cherry notes shaded by cinnamon and nutmeg. This should stand up to the richest rack of lamb and age well, too. It's tempting to drink now, but should improve through at least 2018.",US-California-Malbec
"Dark color, generous dark-fruit and earth aromas and flavors, and a firmly tannic texture make this quality wine typical of the variety. It has good flavor concentration, with more fruit and light spices pouring out on the finish. It will be best after 2019.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Pink in color, this is a full wine that misses out on freshness. It is clean with ripe strawberry fruits, but it feels fat and heavy. Screwcap.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Everything is overpowering with this wine, from the weight of the bottle, to the alcohol, to the intense flavors. It is an impressive one-glass-only wine, packed with concentrated juicy fruity, spice and wood flavors. Drink now.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This smells nice and rooty, and also a bit like strawberry jam. It feels steely, zesty, juicy and almost too acidic, with blazing red plum and pie cherry flavors that are offset by integrated, spicy oak. It's dry and tangy on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This full-bodied Barbera opens with aromas of mature plum, violet, vanilla, toasted oak, sage and coffee. The firm palate offers black currant, raspberry, clove and anise accompanied by vibrant acidity and fine-grained tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"All Grenache from Angiolina Farm, this pretty, pale-salmon-colored wine offers aromas of fresh herbs, wet copper penny and strawberry. It drinks dry with tart, fleshy-feeling fruit flavors.",US-Washington-Rosé
"Briary, herbal berry aromas are dry, earthy, foresty and show a note of olive. This Cab is full of life on the palate, with energy and good overall balance. Spicy flavors of baked plum, olive, herbs and tobacco finish long, with amplified oak. Drink now through 2018.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Amid the pear and apple fruit plays a more exotic note of something alluring and spicy, perhaps passion fruit. This intense fruitiness plays on, supported equally by bouncy citrus freshness and deep concentration.",Austria-Kremstal-Riesling
"Very neutral on the nose, this sparkling blend of Prosecco, Chardonnay and Moscato presents a thin, watery wine with slight, almost invisible shadings of stone fruit and citrus. There's more action in the mouth thanks to its crisp finish and bubbly foam.",Italy-Veneto-Sparkling Blend
"Earthy nose of dried underbrush, truffle and scorched soil give way to cranberry and sour cherry flavors. Dried herb and dark spice add some depth while tightly packed astringent tannins leave a mouth-puckering finish. It's rather straightforward but let the tannins relax for another few years then drink.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Pungent and acidic to the brink of sour, this tastes like unsweetened grapefruit juice. Though not especially typical for Riesling, it might be a pleasant match for fresh oysters.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Spicy herbal notes creep into a ripe nose of apricot and red apple. The same savory, earthy touch plays on the softened palate.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Riesling
"This full-bodied red opens with aromas of mature plum, hay, underbrush and scorched earth. The ripe, juicy palate doles out layers of black cherry, strawberry, tobacco and cinnamon alongside chewy tannins. It's already enjoyable but will also age well for several years. Enjoy through 2019.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"A stylish, easy drinking white wine, dry and mouthwatering in acidity, with apricot, tangerine, papaya,honey and vanilla flavors. The blend is Grenache Blanc and Roussanne.",US-California-Rhône-style White Blend
"The 2013 entry-level Shirazes from Barossa provide a great opportunity for wine consumers to rediscover Australia. This one is solidly structured and savory, boasting hints of black olive, dark chocolate and espresso. The finish is completely dry and firm, suggesting it'd be a fine accompaniment to beef or lamb. Drink now–2025.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"This wine is a unique blend of Malbec (60%), Syrah (20%), Merlot (15%) and Petit Verdot. It opens with brooding but alluring aromas of dark plum, asphalt, and a kiss of baking spice. The flavors are full bodied and palate coating, showing weight but also a sense of suppleness that charms the senses.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Produced from vineyards in the hills above the Côte de Nuits, this wine benefits from the ripe vintage of 2015. It has open red fruit and soft tannins that are both lifted by the acidity. Made to be drunk young, this is ready to enjoy now.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of well-toasted oak, cinnamon, crushed stones, cassis and plum form a fine nose. This is bullish on the palate, where heavy tannins clomp along. Savory flavors of tree bark, herbs and blackberry finish woodsy, with lightly stewed plum notes and hints of oregano and thyme. Drink from 2017–2025.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"All varietal, aromas of crushed rock, black licorice, barrel spice, green pepper, pink peppercorns and savory herbs lead to a well-balanced palate backed by firm, lightly grainy tannins. It needs time still to fully come together but has more than enough stuffing to go the distance.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"While this wine is lean initially, it also shows weight and the potential of ripe fruits. Concentrated tannins still allow room for a little juicy fruit. The overall effect is of structure triumphing over fruitiness. Made by the team at Domaine de Chevalier, the wine will take time to develop. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Spicy earthy briary aromas include a note of cola along with requisite berry and cassis scents. A slightly choppy mouthfeel and flavors of blueberry, cardamom, herbs and oak define the palate, while this finishes fruity and open. Drink through 2024.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"A simple wine, but the price is right, and it will do well at a big party. Shows sweetly ripe blackberry and cherry fruit, with a nice, full-bodied mouthfeel.",US-California-Meritage
"Full, forward, fleshy nose shows lots of bright, spicy fruit. Unlike a lot of lower cost Zins, this wine has a lot of sweet fruit, and enough body and weight to carry through past the nose into a big, satisfying finish. Nice toast, plenty of acid, a bit hot in the finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Broadly fruity, with a palate of mixed red berries and cherries. Light and balanced, this is well-made, of medium length, and ready to drink right away.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A deliciously dry wine, evoking flavors of crisp green-apple skins and white currants; this is elegant despite its weight and body. It has freshness, certainly, and needs some bottle age. The style is ripe, but the dryness gives some opening austerity.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Ripe blackberry, cassis and refined wood are the key aromas on this fruit-forward, slightly grapy Malbec that's full and jammy on the palate, with big, bold flavors of boysenberry, chocolate and spices. There's not a ton of nuance to this bruiser, which finishes with toast and chocolate flavors and a rich residual feel. Drink through 2017.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"All varietal from the winery's vineyard, this bottling offers aromas of toast, tar, dark fruit and spice. It's reserved in style with plum and spice flavors that narrow around the edges.",US-Washington-Malbec
"Smooth, deep aromas of bacon and dark berry form a proper and likable greeting. The palate is tight, with piercing but balanced acidity creating lift and structure. Tastes of bacon, vanilla, raspberry and plum, with cured meat, vanilla and coconut on the finish. Drink now through 2016.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Half Z'Ivo and half Illahe vineyard fruit, this aromatic wine punches up its relatively light flavors of cranberry fruit with an array of side notes. Leather, cola, dust, chalk and brown spices come into play, as the finish tilts towards the rustic.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This sends up scents of grape jam, plum and cherry, and those round and forward fruit flavors combine in the mouth. It's a tasty young wine, with plenty of immediate appeal from its lollipop-rainbow flavors.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Made from fruit that was sourced from a 2.4-acre plot on the steep slopes of Vergisson, this is an intense, ripe, wood-aged wine. The acidity is allied to the spice and yellow fruit flavors. A concentrated wine of great purity, this is worth aging for several years.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A very pale flamingo-pink rosé, this is moderately confected in style, but vibrant and fresh. Cotton candy notes are balanced by peachy fruit and some floral elements, while the finish is mouthwatering. Drink up.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"This is a very rich Chardonnay, bursting with Key lime pie, ripe golden kiwi, pineapple, buttered toast and crème brûlée flavors. That fine, crisp coastal acidity makes it brisk and clean. Drink now.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A nice bottle of wine, bone-dry and fragrant, with pleasing, simple flavors.",US-Washington-Chenin Blanc
"A high-end Malbec experience at a reasonable price, this boasts rich aromas of cola, graphite and boysenberry that leap from the glass. The palate is bright and just thick enough, with wild berry, cherry, plum and oak-based flavors. Another whack of oak, along with vanilla, chocolate and tobacco flavors, graces the finish. Drink now–2015.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"From the estate, in the Pritchard Hill area of St. Helena which is worthy of its own appellation, comes this densely structured, impressive but young wine. It's massive in fruity extract and new oak, flooding the mouth with soft, ultrarich flavors of blackberries and dark chocolate and a leathery, peppery, grilled meat quality. This is the kind of wine even a non-red wine drinker will be dazzled by, and connoisseurs will appreciate its power and finesse. Ready now for sheer opulence, and should develop through 2012, at least.",US-California-Red Blend
"There are masses of pineapple, apricot, orange and green apple fruit in this Chardonnay, accented with strong Carneros acidity. Quite a good wine, but once you get past the flavors, it falls off in interest. Could be a rare Chardonnay sleeper. Try giving it 2–3 years in the cellar.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Rich, dark and lush, with liqueur-like aromas wafting upward from a sea of purple. An obvious entry into the “modern” category of Brunello. There's jammy, mouthcoating fruit and only modest acidity. Detractors may find it heavy and bruising, but fans will adore its weight and creaminess.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Soft and rounded, this has apple and peach fruits, with a lemon zest texture. The acidity is a refreshing counterweight to the smooth character.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Tart, citrusy acidity backs up cranberry, pomegranate and spice flavors in this dry, silky young Pinot Noir. It's somewhat brusque right out of the bottle, so give it a brief decant before pouring.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"At 70% Garnacha and 30% Tempranillo, this hold-over from the sketchy 2002 harvest starts with an odd blend of clove and shaved wood notes, while the palate pushes basic cherry and tangy raspberry flavors.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"An excellent effort given that 2008 was by no means an excellent vintage. This Tempranillo is loaded with alluring aromas of sous-bois, marzipan, cola, moss and black-fruit aromas. The feel is thorough and pure, with blackberry, black licorice, graphite and chocolate flavors. It's textured and deep, but not overly tannic or hard on the finish. Drink now through 2015.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Pristine tangerine, cantaloupe and lime flavors are refreshing and tart in this delicately concentrated, dry wine. Briskly composed, it's approachable and fresh, with just a hint of earthiness on the finish.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Smoky wood aromas are confirmed on the palate by a tough, wood-laden character. It's all spice and toast, leaving little room at this stage for fruit. That should come because the wine has weight and suggestions of rich berry fruits in the background.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Ripe aromas of blackberry, raisin and cassis blend nicely with graphite and vanilla notes. There's a mild, brooding power to this wine but mostly it's lush and generous, with warm blackberry, prune and licorice flavors. A smooth finish hums along with no tannic bite or hardness. Drink through 2016.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Here is a fresh and straightforward expression of Pinot Grigio with vibrant notes of exotic fruit, papaya and pear. In the mouth, the wine tastes lean, crisp and very cooling.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Aromas of underbrush, rose petal, dark berry, baked earth and game lead the way. The firm, fresh palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and licorice while assertive but refined tannins add a solid grip to the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This crisp, lively rosé is balanced between ripe red fruits and the tight, mineral texture. A high proportion of Pinot Meunier in the blend adds extra fruitiness. With tangy acidity as well as richness, it's ready to drink now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Peachy Canyon NV Mustang Springs Ranch Port (Paso Robles); $40. What you need in a Port-style wine is sugary, caramelized sweetness, the deep, strong taste of fruit, high alcohol and crisp acidity. This wine has them all. But   it lacks that extra depth and complexity that a   Port wants, especially at this price. Still, a solid effort. —S.H.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is 100% Cabernet from three different vineyards, mixing cherry, berry, plum and cassis, and setting the fruit against crisp acids. The tannins, slightly green around the edges, are focused and appropriate. Could it be fleshed out with a little Merlot? Yes, but the elegance and precision of pure Cabernet is somehow more thrilling.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"All varietal, this wine brings aromas of fresh and dried herbs, flowers, tobacco, cocoa and pencil shavings. Ample red fruit flavors are backed by velvety tannins that lead to a spice filled finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"A big, brooding wine, the fruit ripe and dense. Richness surrounds structure, giving a sumptuous layer to the dusty tannins. Flavors of currants, spice and juicy berries flow through the wine, giving power and suavity. The freshness of 2006 shows on the finish of this important wine.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The 2010 vintage is hailed as one of the best ever for the hilltop hamlet of Montalcino. This has touches of worn leather and animal fur, backed by bright notes of cherry and blackberry.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"This light-bodied wine sings in bright, citrus-laden overtones, with enough length and complexity to intrigue. Rocky minerality overlays lemon pith and a delightful crispness that makes for a food friendly, celebratory selection.",US-California-Chardonnay
"88-90 Barrel sample. An intensely spicy wine, full of exotic flavors, dried prunes, figs and a powerful layer of cinammon. The wine certainly has character.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Here's a well-priced wine that offers drying tones of crushed stone and flint, with background notes of green apple and citrus. The wine is tonic and crisp overall.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Peach, rose and lychee unite into a very rich, seamless perfume on the nose. Those exact flavors expand on the fluid, almost oily palate, supported by residual fruit sweetness: at six years of age this is now toned down and has come into its own. If you're after a treat with washed-rind cheeses, choose this medium-sweet gem.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Impressively concentrated for a Pinot Blanc, it offers intense spice as well as crisp apple flavors. It's bright, with good acidity as well as a rich and rounded aftertaste.",France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"A big, fruity wine that starts richly and then becomes drier, more tannic and firmer. The fruit is all black, full of berries and fresh acidity. Finely balanced, with an herbal character to finish it off.",Portugal-Douro-Touriga Nacional
"A lovely counterpoint to Phelps Creek's estate reserve Chardonnay, this comes from just across the river, sourced from a vineyard on the Washington side of this two-state AVA. It got the full malolactic, fermented in French oak treatment, and shows plenty of pleasing barrel toast and spice. The fruit mixes hints of peach and melon with a lemon drop core, and finishes with a lick of butterscotch.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"A tight nose of blackberry and mint smooths the way for flavors of blackberry and pencil lead with a light dose of mint. There is a nice balance of acidity and tannins, with fruit lingering on the palate after the soft finish.",Israel-Galilee-Red Blend
"At the start, there are sweet touches of chestnut honey and barbecue spice, followed by notes of candied fruit, cassis and red currant. This hearty offering would pair with glazed ham or pork shoulder with dried plums.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Two talented winemakers, Sandra Tavares da Silva and Jorge Serôdio Borges, jointly produce wines under the Wine & Soul label. This vintage of Pintas, black as ink, is richly spicy, with peppered fig and raisins over a dense core of dusty tannins. It is seriously powerful, but bears its weight well.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"What a pretty wine! Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, it's delicious and complex, with each of the grape varieties bringing something different. The blackberry, cherry, currant and cedar flavors are wrapped into silky tannins. Should age for 5–6 years, but there's no reason you can't drink it now.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This elegant nectarine-scented Riesling is a notable solo project by Hazlitt winemaker Michael Reidy. It's deft on the palate, but offers plenty of ripe quince and tangerine flavors accentuated by zesty lime acidity. It finishes moderately long.",US-New York-Riesling
"Nuts, sweet figs and spice come together in this delicious wine. It has great freshness as well as the concentrated wood character of a 20-year-old. A great final balance.",Portugal-Port-Port
"While light in body, this lemony spätlese has a textural broadness. Its sweet tangerine and quince flavors are neatly offset by a streak of bright acidity and lingering earth notes. Drink now through 2022.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Gritty, rubbery plum and berry aromas are also a touch smoky. This is solid in mouthfeel, with plum, cherry, spice and mild salty flavors. A dry finish with plenty of woodspice character is a bit hot.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A big Cabernet, showing the dramatic mouthfeel that well-made Napa Cabernet always has. It's full bodied, dry and softly tannic, with classic blackberry and currant flavors. Should hold in the bottle for about six years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Rather bland and done up with butterscotch and cream. And while those aromas indicate heft and richness, the wine is sort of flat and soft, with mealy apple and creamy fruit flavors. And then it finishes pithy and bitter. Not much definition or design. Expensive for what you get.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"The softest apple notes are brought to the surface by the frothy foam. There is a lightness and a welcoming, fruity core of apple and lemon, with a gentle dollop of roundness. The finish is dry but fruit rules in this versatile, light-hearted apéritif.",Austria-Österreichischer Sekt-Sparkling Blend
"The future of Finger Lakes Sauvingnon Blanc is bright, at least in the hands of Steve Shaw. Fragrant with sweet, ripe gooseberries, apples and a touch of herbs and grass, this is a delicious choice for any occasion. Full bodied and complex, its palate is lush with quince and green plums, highlighted by a refreshing minerality and a lime zest astringency.",US-New York-Sauvignon Blanc
"Wild berry, savory herb and balsamic aromas take center stage in this medium-bodied red. The round palate offers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry and a hint of orange zest. Modest acidity and soft tannins make it extremely accessible.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Dry and silky, a very proper Pinot Noir from this fine, cool vintage. It's marked in youth by brisk acids and forward, somewhat one-dimensional flavors of cherries, cola and spices, with the smoky sandalwood of barrel age. Could develop all kinds of surprises over the next 4–6 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"It's been some time since Katnook last submitted samples, so it's reassuring to see that quality there remains high. This medium-bodied Cabernet boasts crisp acids and fine tannins, highlighting notes of red currants, olives and bay leaves. Drink now–2025.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A blend of grapes from different growers, this is a structured, firm wine. It has a core of drying tannins as well as the bright fruitiness of the vintage. As it develops, that fruit will grow richer and fuller yet always maintaining a crisp edge. Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"One of the best Ripasso wines made today, I Progni opens with rich density and soothing aromas of milk chocolate, espresso, ripe cherry, cinnamon spice and toasted almond. The wine show medium, but firm, consistency and a touch of black pepper on the close.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Here's one of the fruitier Pinots you'll ever encounter. It's like diving into a pool of raspberry and cherry jam. There's excellent acidity to balance all that richness, and while it's not a subtle wine, the texture is nice and silky. Drink up.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Real Syrah character pervades this dry, full-bodied red wine. It has flavors of blackberries, mulberries, charred meat and black pepper, wrapped into firm tannins. This is a great price for such a versatile, food-friendly wine.",US-California-Syrah
This is an unusual rosé for Champagne. It is made 100% from Pinot Noir rather than a blend. And it is made by getting color directly from the fermenting grapes rather than the normal Champagne process of adding red wine. The result is a dark-colored rosé that has a tannic structure as well as red fruits. It is rich and concentrated with ripeness rather than great freshness. It is definitely a food wine.,France-Champagne-Pinot Noir
"Bright fruit flavors light up this tart, medium-bodied wine. It smells like raspberries and red cherries, tastes crisp and bright and has a light nip of cranberry-like astringency.",US-California-Barbera
"Ripe Alvarinho from its home turf in the Minho Valley, this wine is immediately attractive while also having a more serious intent. There is a crisp apple edge to this textured wine along with a creamy character that makes it both smooth and intense. Drink this from early 2018.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Alvarinho
"New leather, black cherry, underbrush, sweet baking spice and a whiff of white pepper are just some of the aromas you'll discover on this stunning red. The structured, delicious palate doles out mature black cherry, raspberry, licorice, Mediterranean herb and a note of exotic spice alongside a backbone of polished, refined tannins. It already seamlessly combines power and finesse but will continue to develop complexity over the next decade. Drink 2018–2028.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"There's 5% Cabernet Franc in this Temp, which makes all the difference, bringing greater body and tannins to a variety that, on its own, can be simple. The cherry, cola and licorice flavors are accented with a touch of sandalwood, making for a lovely, medium-bodied red wine to drink now.",US-California-Tempranillo
"A lively and compact Cabernet Franc, with generous cherry aromas and well-integrated oak. Made according to biodynamic principles, it's thick, rich and full of ripe personality. It's a very likeable wine with a pronounced character from a vineyard that was started in 2000. Drink after 2015.",Italy-Tuscany-Cabernet Franc
"Lots of unripe, green flavors compromise this wine. Although it's nicely dry and acidic, with a good citrus flavor, it has a green bean note and a sourness that's hard to enjoy.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Crisp and fruity, this bright, textured wine has a tangy character that is juicy and refreshing. Lively and rich, it is ready to drink although it will be better from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Fresh and full of finesse, this radiant red offers rose, forest floor, woodland berry, new leather and pipe tobacco scents. The palate delivers juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, wild herb and white pepper notes, finishing on star anise. Taut, refined tannins and bright acidity give it intensity, lift and balance. Give it time to develop to its full potential. Drink 2020–2032.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"The style is rich and ripe fruit, with the fruit pushing through into tropical. Nice handling of the oak adds just enough butter and light spice. A hint of bitterness mars the finish.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"This is textbook Rioja gran reserva from a ripe, generous year. Aromas of cassis and prune blend with toasty, creamy oak. Fresh acidity is a lifesaver, because the tannins and oak level are up there. Flavors of tobacco, currant, vanilla and red plum end with a reprise of crisp acids and oak. This will last another 20 years before any fading comes into play.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Soft and ripe enough to drink now, after a decent decanting, it shows pure raspberry, blueberry and cherry fruit flavors, subtlely accented with cola and baking spices, and all of it wrapped into thick but smooth tannins. Good as it is, it will gain traction over the next 15 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This full-bodied wine is in the classic mode, offering very ripe and even overripe aromas. Voluptuous berry flavors verge on sweet, and the rich texture comes without a lot of drying tannin.",US-California-Zinfandel
"The blend is classic Bordeaux—85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. It's got grip and a sensuous mix of wild herb, black olive and mountain berry. There is plenty of acid to support it, and winemaker J-F Pellet has been pulling back on the new oak, so that newer releases of Pepper Bridge are more structured and tilting more toward a European sensibility, which is to say, ageworthy.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A beautiful wine, sharp and clean in acidity and savory, with ripe lemon, lime, pineapple and grapefruit citrus flavors. Finishes dry and honeyed, a paradox.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"With a proportion of premier cru grapes in the blend, this wine has weight and structure as well as the ripe red-fruit flavors that are typical of Santenay. It's richly textured and full in the mouth. The finish is fruity and soft.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This wine begins with aromas of ripe black fruit, prune, spice, leather and a hint of espresso. The palate is dominated by oak, delivering toast, roasted coffee bean, prune and fig alongside excruciatingly dry wood tannins that generate an abrupt and bitter finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This old-vine site, now entering its fifth decade, brings a lean, tight profile to this wine, with a strong mineral foundation. The structure and sleek styling, with tangy raspberry fruit and a slightly chalky finish, suggest that this wine will improve now through 2025 and beyond.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Peach and apricot aromas give way to vanilla and resiny oak notes. This blend of Viura, Malvasia and Garnacha Blanca is full in body and has taken well to oak. Melon, green banana and wood spice flavors are dry and elegant on the finish. Drink through 2021.",Spain-Northern Spain-White Blend
"New leather, menthol, ripe berry and Asian spice aromas emerge in the glass while the firm palate offers dried black cherry, pomegranate, star anise and a hint of game. You'll also notice a green note of powdered sage. Assertive, close-grained tannins squeeze the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Three different clones are used, all estate grown. There's a lovely wild clover scent to it, and very tart, dark fruit. Though it needs more time to smooth out, it shows streaks of iron and mineral, adding excellent flavor and depth. Structured to age.",US-Oregon-Tempranillo
This wine has a touch of caramel as well as spice. Both work well with the red fruits that shine through this ripe wine. It is ready to drink.,France-Bordeaux-Rosé

Should age well for up to eight years.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"This would pair with cold cuts, oven-roasted pizza or bruschetta with wild mushrooms. It is simple, clean and redolent of wild berries and tart cherry.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This stunning wine is all about extreme elegance and subtlety. It opens with aromas of wild red berry, rose petal, sweet baking spice and a whiff aromatic herb while the focused palate delivers red cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, pipe tobacco and white pepper. A firm backbone of polished tannins and vibrant acidity gives it an age-worthy structure. It's loaded with finesse and should develop even more complexity over time. Drink 2018–2033.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Here is a very likable Aglianico del Vulture with bright spice flavors, big concentration and black fruit. The wine is dark and impenetrable with thick tannins and chewy succulence.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico

"Darkly seductive in cinnamon and blackberry, this wine is hugely mouth-filling and a tad chewy, ready for a gigantic steak off the grill, preferably while out on the range. Coffee and pepper figure prominently in this wine, especially on the finish.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Made from Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc grown in the warm Happy Canyon region of the valley, this shows the greatness of the 2007 vintage. It's ready to drink, bearing soft, gentle tannins that frame flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate, vanilla and sweet, smoky oak.",US-California-Merlot
"Dark and savory, this has spicy aromas of clove, cinnamon, prune and red currant. It shows freshness and medium density overall.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"The nose has the rich fruity tones of apple and plum peel. The palate is wonderfully clean and fresh, with a slight phenolic frame which lends both structure and texture. There is slight pepper spice, too, and a whole host of red, ripe apples.",France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"A notable success in the precarious territority of New York State Cabernet Franc. Cherry aromas and toasty vanilla notes make for a charming nose while the palate shows surprisingly forward, ripe fruit and plush tannins.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"Equal parts Mourvèdre and Grenache finished with 10% Syrah, this ripe wine offers aromas of dried herbs, coffee and candied red fruit. It's rich and layered with abundant cherry flavors that lead to a light squeeze of tannins that hold on through the fruit-filled finish.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is a finely etched wine with just the right balance between its ripe fruits and tannins. Structured while also juicy, it has a mint and black-currant freshness as well as a dry core that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This semisweet Riesling balances an intensely fruit-forward profile of ripe yellow cherry and quince flavors against a backdrop of crisp, tart tangerine acidity. It's sunny and bright, yet elegantly composed, with a bristle of fresh herb notes that linger on the finish.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Wonderful purity is on display in this mineral-driven, tart, racy and expressive Syrah from the estate vineyard. The bright and tangy berry flavors may strike some palates as a bit on the sour side, but there is more than enough ripeness here for most. This is succulent and classy.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Freshly cut red apples on the nose are very appetizing. The palate adds an strawberry note with frothy, refreshing and lively bubbles. This is an exquisite summer wine, spelling ease, joy and refreshment, with a just off-dry finish. It virtually calls for a picnic basket.",Austria-Burgenland-Blaufränkisch
"A classically styled, beautifully made red, this is defined by its well-chiseled structure and sanguine characteristics, as well as notes of cranberry, dried herb and anise. Lush and full-bodied, it has additional elements of pencil shavings and meaty game, complex and interesting to the end. Enjoy best 2022 through 2032.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This informal red offers aromas of ripe blackberry and Mediterranean herb. The round, simple palate shows black cherry, ripe blackberry and ground cooking spice alongside soft, fleeting tannins. Drink now.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"White blossom perfume accents notes of fresh lemon, lime and green melon in this aromatic Silvaner. While dry in style, it's refreshingly juicy on the palate, bursting with pristine citrus flavor tinged by edges of lime and lemon pith. Mouth filling and rich in texture, it clings lusciously through a long finish.",Germany-Franken-Silvaner
"Funky aromas of game, powdered herb and scorched soil lead the nose. The tightly wound palate isn't very expressive, but eventually shows raw cherry, thyme and a hint of star anise while astringent tannins leave a rough, mouth drying finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Toast, espresso, coffee bean and dark berry aromas emerge on this firmly structured red. It's still very much on its oak, showing unripe sour cherry backed up by oak-driven spice including vanilla and coconut alongside grippy tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Soupy berry aromas with cheesy oak notes make for an earthy, challenging nose. This feels full, grabby and highly tannic. Medicinal berry and cherry flavors are accented by brown-sugar sweetness and chocolaty spice on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Resiny oak is front and center on the nose, turning any and all fruit spicy. The palate is wet and basic, with a woody feel and oaky flavors that include spices and white fruits. Offers proper weight but smells and tastes overtly resiny.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"A stalky, herbal wine, its wood and black currant fruits are overlaid with a tight, dry tannic character and intense acidity. It is young and will soften, but that acidity is sure to remain.",France-Provence-Rhône-style Red Blend
"To say the least, it comes out guns blazing and oozing mountain character. Animal and barnyard, coffee and earth, even burnt toast and smoky bacon are all over this wine. Fruit definitely plays second fiddle to the dark, earthy essence of this Cabernet, Merlot and Cab Franc trio.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Whiffs of nuts, dusty mineral and lemon are demure on the nose, but become more concentrated on the palate of this dry white. A blend of Chardonnay, Riesling and Grüner Veltliner, it's more minerally than fruity, but refreshing and brisk.",US-New York-White Blend

"Briny aromas of sauerkraut fail to make much of an impression. This is dull in feel, with bitter, fruitless flavors. On the finish, bitterness remains. Drinkable but with few positives.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"A perfumed, floral white, its citrus character is laced with flavors of apricot and green plums. This is a summer day's wine with a cool, refreshing feel to its smooth and ripe texture.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"There's a change in the 2011 blend: There's no Roussanne, and it's almost one-quarter Marsanne. It's a tight, steely wine, with bracing acidity and citrus rind flavor, which is reflective of the vintage. Grapefruit and Meyer lemon notes come into play, and it remains balanced through the finish",US-Washington-Viognier
"This barrel-fermented wine drinks like a beautifully proportioned Chardonnay. It takes bright, intense fruit flavors of melon, yellow apples and green bananas, and puts a Burgundian spin on the mouthfeel with judicious acids and a touch of caramel. It's delicious, complex and should age nicely for another five to six years.",US-Oregon-Pinot Blanc
"This is a perfumed wine that has the crispest fruit, lively acidity and a light, ethereal character that reflects the Riesling well. It could age a year, but is ready to drink now.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"A 30-year-old tawny that shows great intensity and rich dried fruits and honey as well as the woody flavors from long aging in barrel. It's a very fine wine, dry in character with touches of bitter marmalade and finished with intense acidity. Like all tawnies, the wine is ready to drink.",Portugal-Port-Port

"Cavallotto still travels under the radar, but is one of the finest Barolo producers. Its Bricco Boschis is bold and beautiful, offering intense rose and berry aromas layered with eucalyptus. The creamy palate delivers cherry, spice and balsamic notes, along with hints of Alpine herbs. To let this complex wine develop fully, drink it after 2019.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Aromas of orange, pineapple and guava are ripe but bright on the nose of this fresh white. Flavors of green plum and apple skin lend verve to the medium-weight mouthfeel, in addition to cleansing acidity that enlivens the finish. Drink now.",South Africa-Western Cape-Chenin Blanc
"Light and fruity, this is an attractive, rounded wine. With its bright acidity, touch of minerality and orange-peel flavor, it is open and ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Aromas of violets and cherries are intoxicating on this intensely concentrated yet elegant Bordeaux-style blend. Dry in style with hints of crushed granite and spice, it's balanced with spritely acidity and a ruffle of soft, delicate tannins.",US-New York-Meritage
"This powerful, rich and complex wine comes from a low-yielding vineyard that produced just 2.5 tons per acre, and the meticulous label even shows the amount of fog days. Deep and jammy aromas of strawberry preserves, cherry pie, brown sugar, hot licorice and smoked meats give way to a sultry palate that shows nuanced layers of berries, black pepper, mace and baking spice.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Baked cinnamon and cherry tart form a promising beginning into this wine, but an intrusive addition of root beer pushes it over the edge in terms of cloying flavor. The wine then becomes somewhat flimsy on the palate.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Aromas evoking tropical fruit, cut grass and a whiff of tomato vine lead the nose. On the straightforward palate, notes of medicinal herb underscore pineapple and ripe peach.",Italy-Tuscany-White Blend
"This is a spirited, funky white made from old vines, the wine aged in neutral oak. High in acidity, it has flavors of white peach and coconut.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
The wine is ripe and full of blackberry fruits. It has serious tannins still although these are well balanced by the fruitiness. The firm structure and wood aging flavor will soften over the next few years. Drink from 2020.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A very good wine from one of the newer entries to the Farrell pantheon of vineyard-designated Chardonnays. It's brisk in acidity, with voluptuous tropical fruit and green apple flavors. New oak brings the usual complexities of buttered toast and vanilla. The texture is just a little scoury. Drink now.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is round, while also having a mineral edge. Apple and wood flavors power through the crispness, along with a charming touch of honey. For short-term aging.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
This pure Touriga Nacional is full of black-currant fruit. Along with its mineral texture it has some good aging ability as well as the richness. Maybe a little less wood aging would have helped bring out the obvious fruitiness and fruit tannins of this wine. Drink from 2019.,Portugal-Dão-Touriga Nacional
"Whiffs of pink grapefruit, guava and blossom entice on this dry, yet lush, full-bodied Riesling. The palate is round and ripe with flavors of yellow cherry and peach, but it's slick and steely with minerality too. Finishes long with a line of focused acidity.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"This wine is made with wild yeasts and is unfiltered. It has an earthy bouquet of plum, truffle, black currant and spice. The palate delivers a delicious blackberry core, layered with cinnamon, white pepper and nutmeg accents. This is well balanced, with velvety tannins and fresh acidity.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Bright and bursting aromas of pomegranate and very ripe cranberry mesh with rose petals and hibiscus on the nose of this blend of 52% Grenache, 27% Syrah and 21% Mourvèdre. The palate shows a fresh vibrancy and interesting complexity, with Indian spice giving nuance to a red-fruit frame.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This wine is fruity although it also has weight and a rich strand of spice and red plum-skin tannins. This 100% Gamay could age at least until early 2016, although one can just drink it now.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Here's a casual but extremely enjoyable wine made with 85% Sangiovese and 15% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It boasts ripe black cherry and red currant flavors accented with notes of mocha, white pepper and clove alongside silky-smooth tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"More complex and richly textured than most Provençal rosés, this wine is a treat, from its mineral-laden, smoky aromas to its ripe cherry-berry flavors and layered finish. Drink now, although it has enough stuffing to suggest it might last longer than just a single summer.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Thin and green flavors dominate this Cabernet Franc. Small amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot do not seem to have made an impact. It's sharp, stiff, and quite herbal.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"A beautiful Syrah. It's very dry and softly tannic, with complex blackberry, black cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors. Could be firmer in structure, but a lovely wine to drink now.",US-California-Syrah
"Seemingly sweet and light bodied, this features raspberry, vanilla, brown sugar and cinnamon flavors. It's a delicious wine in the way of a granola candy bar. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This blend of 60% Carmenère and 40% Carignan opens with campfire, cassis, chocolate, oak and minty aromas. A wall of acidity greets you on the palate, creating a clampy, rough feel. In terms of flavor, oak is up front and behind that there's graphite and minty, herbal fruit in front of a finish with tobacco, vanilla and length.",Chile-Central Valley-Red Blend
"After a few minutes in the glass, this stunning wine opens up to reveal classic Nebbiolo aromas of leather, tilled soil, underbrush, fragrant blue flower and ripe berry.

"Sun-ripened apricot notes emanate from the glass, mingling with aromatic notions of ripe orange. On the precise palate, this beguiling fruit is joined by subtle, lifted hints of citrus foliage and zest. This is a wonderfully slender but profound wine, showing Riesling from its most charming bewitching side.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Riesling
"The elements of cherry, mint and cedar on the nose show a touch of age, and the dry cherry fruit on the palate seems to vie with wood for prominence. Overall it's quite angular, but does show some attractive earthy notes and a chalky element on the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"It's the play on roses (the flowers) on the label that makes this bottle seem bright and fun. The wine itself is light and fruity with ripe flavors from the lees aging. There is spice, plenty of acidity and a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Very light-bodied, slight but textbook Grüner with green pear fruit on nose and palate and an almost fizzy, refreshing and utterly appetizing hint of white pepper. Gives a superclean, pear-drop finish.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"A bit thin on the nose, this has buttery apple juice aromas. The acidity is a bit off, both tart and mixed with vanilla creaminess, and the flavors are slight with apple candy and tart lemon.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A pale-pink color, this Syrah rosé brings aromas that start out a bit reduced. This is followed by notes of strawberry, apple, melon and herb. It drinks a hair off dry, with plentiful strawberry and cherry flavors. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for with easy-drinking appeal.",US-Washington-Rosé
"The Casa de Santar estate, still inhabited by its aristocratic owners, is run by Global Wines. From one parcel, Vinha dos Amores, they have produced this impressively ripe wine with its dense tannins. Full of spice, black plum skin texture and balanced acidity, it's serious, concentrated and only just mature. Drink now or cellar until 2028.",Portugal-Dão-Touriga Nacional
"Powerful and precise, but with a cloudy color. On the nose and in the mouth this aged version of the venerable Drysack shows considerable freshness, tang and complexity. It's edgy yet deep, with caramel and mushroom notes going head to head with acidic intensity. Sherry is rarely more balanced than this; it's lively and rich, balanced yet racy.",Spain-Andalucia-Sherry
"Relatively lightweight, the wine has soft, stalky tannins and flavors of hedgerow fruits to go with the well-judged layer of smoky wood. It is dry, firm and fresh.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Imagine a Sauvignon Blanc with the weight of Chardonnay, and that's what you get with this single-vineyard wine. It's amazing, because the wine never saw oak. Still, it has a vanilla richness on top of pineapple, peach, anise and honeysuckle flavors. Maybe the correct comparison is of a white Cabernet Sauvignon, with the complexity that implies. What a great value.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"A blanket of sweet-seeming, oaky, baking-spice flavors wraps around ripe fruit in this medium-bodied, supple and relaxed wine. It will be a lot of fun for people who like the full-on new-oak style.",US-California-Zinfandel

"Winemaker Steve Goldfield brings the same deft touch he displays with Pinot Noir to this lush, elegant wine. It has the structure of a gentle Merlot, but with the wild cherry and raspberry, date nut cake, cocoa, pepper and clove flavors that make it so distinctive and savory. This is consistently one of the best Zins from the RRV.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A majority of Cabernet Sauvignon makes up this wine, blended with 14% Malbec, 14% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot and 2% Cabernet Franc. Thick and velvety with strong notes of dark chocolate, espresso and brambly blackberry, it has a juicy middle before finishing fairly flat.",US-California-Meritage

That woodiness dominates the palate, where juniper and pine sap meet with crushed espresso bean and graphite in the tightly wound structure.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This bottling is usually among the more opulent, successful white dessert wines in California, and the '07 certainly fits that bill. With 20.1% residual sugar, it's fantastically sweet, yet has enough fruity stuffing, balanced by high acidity, to satisfy. The pineapple, apricot and orange flavors could be somewhat more intense but it's certainly a very delicious dessert wine.",US-California-Riesling

"The nose of this blend of 58% Syrah, 17% Cabernet Franc, 9% Merlot, 8% Malbec and 8% Petite Sirah is a touch funky, with sour blackberry, charcoal and dried meat aromas. Charred blueberry, sour black plum and savory meat flavors show on the palate.",US-California-Red Blend
"Kirsch, brown stem, herb and olive aromas give way to a powerful mouthful of black fruit speckled with savory accents. The finish lingers.",US-Washington-Syrah

Floral notes persist on the palate as well, but are elegantly balanced with soft mineral tones and an invigorating lime acidity. Distinctly elegant, it finishes with a lingering hint of tea leaves.",US-New York-Riesling

"This blend from individual blocks includes 94% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 2% Merlot.

"This estate whose name means four winds is in the Douro Superior, the easternmost part of the Douro region.

"Hits the popular Chardonnay sweet spot right down the middle, with honey, orange, apricot and oak flavors, with a creamy, buttery mouthfeel.",US-California-Chardonnay

Shows cherry, cola, tangerine zest and spicy flavors. Good through 2010 or so.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A classy Pinot Noir that shows the attributes of its vintage and origin.

That method yields a wine with more structure, faint tannins and a noticeable toasty character. Its red fruit is vivid and rich, the wine ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This is an impressive Barolo by a wine company (with superstar consulting enologist Carlo Ferrini at the head of winemaking) that is relatively new to the scene.

"Marimar's first Albariño is unquestionably one of the best ever to hail from California. Made without oak, it's modest in alcohol, giving it a light, transparent mouthfeel that transmits pure, bone dry flavors of peaches, grapefruits and guava, with a touch of Sauvignon Blanc-like gooseberry and enough acidity to make the palate whistle. A real beauty, especially with Asian fusion fare.",US-California-Albariño
"Not really dry, but off-dry to semi-sweet, with pleasant flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, brioche, vanilla and spice. Nice with fresh fruit and sweet country ham.",US-California-Sparkling Blend

"Boysenberry aromas and blackberry jam flavors fill this Bordeaux-style red blend to the brim, while a smooth texture and touch of sweetness make it an easy sipper. A great pairing for spicy Korean barbecue.",US-California-Red Blend
"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this is aromatic, with notes of ripe peach, melon and honeysuckle. It's full bodied, somewhat viscous in feel, carrying considerable alcoholic warmth.",US-Oregon-Viognier
A dry wine with a soft texture that suggests a small amount of residual sugar. It is a fruity wine with apricot and ripe pear flavors and a smooth aftertaste that still leaves plenty of room for acidity. Drink now.,France-Southwest France-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This is a small property under the same ownership as Château Paloumey. It is unusual in the 20% Petit Verdot that goes into the blend. That gives the wine its deep color and rich generous black-plum fruit. Solid and dense, the wine will age well. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A smoky narcissus note is upfront and almost obtrusive, with brooding notes of spiced black fruit and char lurking in the background. The tannins are drying—with the consistency of finely ground sand—and they constrict the flavors a bit. A food wine for sure, it needs to be paired with a slab of rare meat.",US-Virginia-Cabernet Franc
"Structured and firm, this dense wine shows strong tannins, dark black fruits and very ripe flavors. With weight, concentration, it is now mature.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese Red
"Moscato d'Asti is such a wonderfully delicious wine and this expression from the folks at Ceretto offers sweet aromas of honey, peach blossom, white flower and acacia. The soft foaming feels lush and creamy in the mouth and those sweet honey flavors leave a lasting impression.",Italy-Piedmont-Moscato
"Aged for 14 months in stainless steel with lees influence, this Viognier is expressive of peach, flower, mineral and crème fraîche. It doesn't pack the flamboyance that many Viognier's do; instead, it demonstrates poise, bearing medium body and balanced acidity. A minerally tang and a squirt of blood orange accent the finish.",US-Virginia-Viognier
"This is an attractive, soft, fresh wine, with concentration and structure, as well as a light, rounded aftertaste.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Bianco
"Weinert holds its wines back longer than almost any other Argentine winery, hence when you get a blend like this it's mature and ready. This is maderized, with aromas of earth, citrus, tobacco and mushroom. The palate is tight and houses tobacco, mocha, citrus and dried raspberry flavors. If you like aged Rioja, this is for you. The blend is Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This opens with aromas of chocolate, licorice and ripe red berry that carry over to the straightforward, jammy palate along with espresso and a toasted note. Astringent tannins grip the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This solid Barolo opens with aromas of mature dark berry, licorice, clove, chewing tobacco and a whiff of crushed flower. The palate reveals red cherry, strawberry, white pepper and thyme alongside bracing tannins. Drink after 2019.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Made in a style that's lower in alcohol and earthier than your typical Napa Valley Cabernet, this bottling has plenty of complex elegance. The blackberry, tobacco and cedar flavors will pair well with steak. Drink now–2017.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Frankly sweet, with 36 g/l of residual sugar, this Marlborough Riesling shows plenty of guava and citrus fruit alongside hints of tar and petrol. The sugar, combined with tart acids, gives the finish a crisp, lipsmacking quality.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Riesling
"Steely and tight, it has intense acidity, a dense texture and powerful green apple and grapefruit flavors. The wine is still finding its way, suggesting considerable potential for long-term aging. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"A racy, citric undertone and spicy toast beckon on this fun, fresh wine from New York. On the palate, there's an impressive roundness and a touch of butter on the tongue, but a very pretty wave of flowers, minerality and zip keep it light.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Although the plush plum and coffee grind flavors combine seductively with hints of bramble and earth in this rustic, full-bodied wine, pervasive notes of char and a stalky, green character make this wine a bit clunky. Sturdy tannins, combined with black spice and tar drive a long finish.",US-New York-Merlot
"The best of the 2011 Pinots from Bergström, this firm and balanced wine is based upon a solid core of raspberry and cherry fruit. Nicely framing the ripe fruit flavors are streaks of herb, leaf and stem, all in proportion with not a hint of bitterness. A lick of orange peel elevates the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"One of the best sparkling Vouvrays, this 2005 vintage has an extra richness from the year. It has the mineral, chalky edge of Chenin Blanc, but this is rounded out with pear, white peach and sweet almond flavors. Good to drink now, but also worth aging for 2–3 years.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"A blend of Peachy Canyon Estate (67%) and Mustang Springs Ranch (33%) fruit. In this vintage the Peachy Zins seem to lack intensity, but this is a well-balanced effort that shows the best of what is there. Clean, forward fruit, with lots of blueberry and a light, toasty framework. Good wine, but pricey.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This Chardonnay shows a beautiful minerality supported by rich and pronounced flavors of cantaloupe, wood-grilled peaches and smokey roasted almonds. It's medium weight and lush in the mouth, with a long evolving finish. Drink while it's still got some chill to it, as the alcohol is a bit too pronounced after warming too much.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Chardonnay
"Failla reaches into this new appellation within Napa Valley for this vineyard-designated Chard. It's a little heavier and softer than the Chardonnays from Sonoma County usually associated with the winery. Very rich in tropical fruits and pears, while the oak is lavish in vanilla and buttered toast. Drink now.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Whiffs of smoke, spice and nut oil add an alluring maturity to this Riesling. The palate is gorgeously fruity, with loads of concentrated sweet peach, dried apricot and honey flavors, but it's honed and steely, with a long laser-beam finish.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Slightly earthy aromas blow off with aeration to reveal a delightfully balanced wine full of juicy, concentrated peach, lychee and rose water flavors. While intensely floral and a touch sweet on the palate, sunny acidity lends a brisk, easy drinking feel. Drink now.",US-New York-Gewürztraminer
"Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this is a wine to pour with casual meals. It's on the lean side, with raw cherry-berry sensations, soft acidity and angular tannins. Drink soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Hailing from a warm year, this wine is still a brute. Smoky, rubbery aromas of cassis and strawberry vascilate between ripe and candied. This is full-volume, even pushy, on the palate, with blazing acidity and rocky, spicy, peppery berry flavors. Let this rest at least another five years; revisit in 2019–2020.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This balanced, fruity wine has gentle tannins and juicy red fruit flavors. It's fresh with acidity and a floral character that makes it already drinkable.",France-Southwest France-Red Blend
"Slightly sweet, this light, smooth and juicy wine has mild aromatics of citrus fruit and floral notes, and pretty melon and pippin apple flavors.",US-California-Riesling
"Heavy oak greets you on the nose in the form of shoe polish and blackened aromas. This feels ripe, solid and woody, with good structure. Flavors of plum, mint and oak resin turn spicy and minty if given time, while the finish is driven by crisp acidity and plum and raspberry flavors.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"There's an elegant weave to the aromas of this bottling, with soy, dried dill, peppercorns, crushed gravel and a touch of cedar laced throughout the black fruit on the nose. Perfectly rounded black currant, black cassis and black cherry fruits show on the sip, which is leveled by violets and pencil shavings.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Black cherry, cooked fig and prune fruit flavors are set in thick tannins. There's a bitter character similar to dark roasted espresso.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This opens with fruity aromas of plum and black berry, alongside whiffs of tilled earth and spice. It's still a bit closed but the palate reveals black cherry, raisin and clove supported by a tannic backbone. Drink 2015–2021.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"Fresh and blossomy, this elegant medium-bodied rosé offers loads of raspberry fruitiness, but also a deeply mineral spine of chalk and sea breeze. Made predominantly from Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it holds smaller proportions of Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay that lend complexity and nuance.",US-New York-Rosé
"Age has mellowed this potent Port-style wine a bit but hardly tamed it. The dark auburn edge to the otherwise black color hints at its maturity as do the pruny nutty roasted-cherry flavors. It's very full bodied and definitely sweet, but not cloying.",US-California-Red Blend
Moulin's gravelly four-acre Merlot plot offered up plenty of fruit for a ripe and smooth wine. It has tannins that are under the red-berry fruits. Hints of wood aging and ripe fruitiness combine to give a wine with good potential. Drink from 2018.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Hannah is a particular block from the winery's Tualatin Estate, and shows cool-climate fruit flavors of rhubarb and pomegranate. A light dusting of brown spices and toasted walnuts add complexity. Overall, it's a fine effort in a difficult year.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Vineyard-designated Grenache is a rarity in the Northwest. This one is all about subtlety and elegance of expression, with aromas of candied raspberry, thyme, spice and wildflowers leading to a textured, pillowy palate that possesses an ethereal lightness and great length.",US-Oregon-Grenache
"From one of the most famous vineyard slopes in Sancerre, the wine is tight, structured and still young. It has great potential with rich citrus, herbs and green fruit flavors. Along with the tense, mineral texture, the wine has both concentration and aging ability. Drink from 2019.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This Barbera is soft, sweet and simple. It shows the rich tannins of the variety, but isn't ageworthy. Tastes like melted blackberry jam mixed with anise, black pepper and smoke.",US-California-Barbera
"Fresh raspberry and blackberry flavors liven up this juicy wine. A strong note of sweet maple syrup comes out in the aroma and the flavors. It feels soft in texture and medium-bodied, but a sheen of tannin makes the finish dry.",US-California-Red Blend
"Named after the convent of Tomar, a home to the medieval Knights Templar (now a national monument), this is a ripe structured wine that benefits from the Cabernet Sauvignon and Touriga Nacional in the blend. Full and rich and with the ability to age, the wine is serious and full of fruit. Drink now.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
A gentle wine with open and generous soft berry fruits showing through dusty tannins and lively acidity. This is likely to develop relatively fast into a delicious wine.,France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"A densely tannic wine that is showing fine aging potential. It is well endowed with weight, acidity and ripe black currant fruits. With the rich fruit that opens slowly in the mouth, it has a fine combination of sweetness and structure. Age for 5–6 years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The initials refer to the vineyard of Mont Damné, the steepest vineyard in Sancerre. The wine reflects the stony character of the soil, coming through with great intensity. It is powerful, flinty, with a biting citrus character, deliciously taut and intense.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Still closed, this is redolent of the elegant, nutty notes of new French oak which nonetheless complement the ripe but supple cherry fruit. The tannins are superfine and the addition of peppery Zweigelt to this Cabernet-Merlot blend lends spice and verve to the mix. This was made for the long run, so give it some bottle age and allow it to meld into its elegant self. Drink from 2018.",Austria-Burgenland-Red Blend
"Made in large-enough quantities to be widely available, as well as at a rare price point for the appellation, this is a bit of a find. Juicy in red-fruit tones yet supported by drying tannins, this is pleasurably perplexing, with a hint of mint on the nose. Full bodied, it finishes with tobacco and fig. Cellar through 2020.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Bacca Bianca from the vineyards of Tenuta di Budonetto, is a blend of Inzolia, Grecanico and Chardonnay. This wine is slightly muddled aromatically, but it does possess a fresh, zesty mouthfeel.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"Oily and blowsy smelling, with almondy aromas and a pinch of citrus. The palate is heavy and chunky, with sweet, overripe flavors of pineapple and peach. Sweet and stalky on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"Firm and polished, this barrel-fermented wine is just rounded off enough, without damping the bright, almost crunchy fruit. There's a light touch of toast and the structure for further bottle age to improve it. Drink 2017–2025.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"This is dark and brooding, showing earthy aromas of tilled earth, leather and farmyard. The palate is big and ripe, with black fruit, nutmeg and white pepper flavors.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend

"Tart and sharply-defined, this single-vineyard effort offers edgy flavors of melon, apple, pineapple and jicama. The vineyard's signature minerality is evident as well.",US-Washington-Roussanne
"For the price you can't go wrong with a wine like this. It's flowery and fruity, and beyond that it doesn't pretend to be more than it is. There's a natural creaminess to the feel and full melon and white fruit flavors. Proof that some Chardonnays do better without oak.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"From the southernmost part of the appellation comes this very deeply flavored Pinot Noir. It bursts in the mouth with mushu plum sauce and cherry fruit and the most marvelous feral notes of mushrooms, minerals, hung meat, forest spices and herbs. It's quite a tannic wine, giving it a brooding quality. Huge, massive, stunning. Should glidepath through the next 6–8 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Enticing aromas of wisteria and white spring flower rise from the glass on this fragrant sparkler. The crisp dry palate is more restrained, offering yellow apple and lemon zest alongside racy acidity and a vibrant perlage.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Slight spritz and a near-neutral nose lead to a light-bodied, fresh white with hints of spice and that lovely phenolic, yeasty edge of Grüner. Yellow plum comes through on the palate, a hallmark of this vintage.",Austria-Weinviertel-Grüner Veltliner
"Soft, round and very ripe, this is simple and straightforward, with big, chewy tannins and flavors of cola and cinnamon. Bright on the nose, it is full-bodied and heavy in the mouth, and it screams out for hearty heaps of grilled food.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This bright, easygoing red offers aromas of truffle, chopped herb and wild berry. The fresh, easy-drinking palate doles out juicy Marasca cherry, white pepper and star anise alongside racy acidity and pliant tannins. Drink soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Although this is ready to drink now, it offers considerable tannins that are wrapped around layers of blackberries, black currants and cedar. The structure is impressive, so let it breathe in a decanter for an hour or two before serving.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The nose is reminiscent of dried pine cones and miso. It is only on the palate that some fruit appears: Hints of red cherry mix with the same pine notes and are fringed with pleasant bitterness. The palate is light in weight but concentrated. This calls out for food—think game and mushroom dishes. The finish is juicy, refreshing and moreish.",France-Alsace-Pinot Noir
"This soft wine is fruity, spicy and full of juicy red fruits. It offers plenty of acidity as well as a layer of tannins. An easy, open wine, it is ready to drink.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay

"A bitter streak of herbal tea seasons a tight grip of tannin in this mountainous wine, structured and burly in wild sage and black cherry. A smoky undercurrent adds intrigue and savory, meaty notes that should be paired with appropriately hearty fare.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"An inviting touch of cinnamon spices the red-cherry notes on the nose. Ripe red cherry and cinnamon also dominate the juicy palate that has a pleasant tannic grip. There is density on the palate and oodles of fruit, focused by freshness. This juicy, balanced red has a lip-smacking cherry finish.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Zweigelt
"With  this bottling, Kenneth Volk has produced the quintessential cool-climate, unoaked Chardonnay. The grape  variety reveals itself strongly, with classic peach and tropical fruit flavors that are very ripe, almost apricoty. The Santa Maria Valley's chilly climate shows up in brisk, mouthwatering acidity, while the finish is thoroughly dry. Additional richness was provided by sur-lie aging, which brings creamy notes.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The nose on this isn't very expressive, but eventually reveals aromas of cooked fruit and a whiff of barnyard. The palate delivers black pepper and cured meat but the fruit has completely dried up. Fleeting but drying tannins give it an astringent finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A nice, easy Cabernet to drink now, this shows real class in its smooth texture and flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cherries and chocolate, nicely accented by sweet, smoky oak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
A smooth and rounded wine that is full of ripe fruits. It has a hint of steely texture and minerality but the white fruit is the immediately attractive aspect of the wine. Drink this wine now.,France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"There's a slightly pungent note on the bouquet that masks some of the fresh floral and fruity aromas inherent to Prosecco. Certified organic, the wine is fresh, clean and crisp in the mouth.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"This is a substantial, dense Syrah, which runs quickly from berries and cherries right into barrel flavors of chocolate and butterscotch. It's balanced and delicious, but does not have the complexity and more interesting earth/herb notes that the grape is capable of.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This blend, which is mainly Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon, is robust. It's a trattoria or bistro wine, dry, tannic and spicy, with earthy flavors. Drink now with rich foods to tease out the berry fruit.",US-California-Red Blend
"This opens with a breeze of air freshener, tropical oils, green fruits and apricots. Fresh and crisp in feel, it has mild green-fruit flavors that are led by notes of lime and lychee. The finish is creamy, tropical and slightly bitter.",Argentina-Other-Torrontés
"With its pale sunset color and light raspberry flavors, this is a fresh, crisp wine. The tang of lemon zest and acidity is part of the fruitiness without dominating. Drink now.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Here's a bright, linear wine that opens with alluring floral aromas that recall Spanish Broom and acacia, with just a whiff of beeswax. The juicy palate offers grapefruit, exotic fruit and pineapple flavors that are accented by energizing mineral notes.",Italy-Southern Italy-Falanghina
"Perhaps this rating will seem conservative in time, but for now this wine shows a bit too much oak-derived toast and vanilla, giving it an air of superficial attractiveness. Cracked pepper, cassis and mixed berries mingle easily on the palate, but seem to fade on the finish. Drink now, or hold another 4–5 years and see what direction things go.",France-Rhône Valley-Syrah
"This 80-20 blend of Sangiovese and Syrah from coastal Tuscany opens with bright fruit, a somewhat lean texture and delivers lively berry notes of wild strawberry and white cherry. A good value, the wine would pair well with pizza or pasta.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Sweet vanilla oak gives this full-bodied, tropical wine its signature, a luscious taste of fruit-forward approachability that risks becoming overdone. From Vine Hill Ridge Vineyard in the heart of the appellation, it exhibits the power and warmth of the vintage.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A rounded perfumed wine with just a hint of sweetness. It is rich, with flavors of honey and peach. Acidity gives the right balance and adds to the structure. Screwcap.",France-Southwest France-Gros Manseng

"This is an attractive, round wine. The ripe red-fruit character is balanced by a tangy, zesty lemon texture that gives freshness plus a touch of tannic structure. Very dry and spicy in the mouth, it will be good with food.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Somebody was carried away with wood here. The wine is totally dominated by flavors of burnt wood— even the 50% new wood was too much in 2007. That said, the fruit could increase in weight and black berry flavors. But not just yet—in another three to four years.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Whiffs of earth and mushroom against a backdrop of intensely aromatic red cherry, fresh herb and spice hint to the future of this bold, complex Bordeaux blend. The palate is juicy with fruit, but shaded with rustic layers of autumn leaves and wet soil, along with a bracing cranberry acidity. It's quite nice now, but should improve further through 2019.",US-New York-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine is clean, fresh and fruity. It is medium sweet, with a bright candy-pink color and light acidity. Drink now.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Rosé
"Almost completely clear and crystalline as ice-cold water, this wine from a Santa Lucia Highlands-based producer shows apple blossoms, Asian pear flesh and white rocks on the clean, fresh nose. It's focused and tight on the palate, suggesting apple and pear peels with pomelo pith.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"Initially this needs a lot of air, so swirl the glass. A simple, fruit-driven, unadulterated Zweigelt, this offers fresh red cherry fruit and a light, slightly rustic body. It makes a lovely picnic wine or accompaniment to cold meats. Drink this honest wine while it's young and fresh.",Austria-Burgenland-Zweigelt
"This is mostly Syrah, with 10% each Grenache and Mourvèdre. Fat and beefy, it starts with a scent of fresh carpaccio around dense black cherry fruit. Lush and generous, with notes of both fruit and barrel, it adds streaks of coffee and cacao that wind through a long and beautifully defined finish.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"While the wood flavors are prominent, they don't mask the ripe berry fruits in this Merlot-dominant blend. Blaye sister-brother team of Marie-Pierre et Pierre-Charles Dartier produced a wine with a rich character. It is full of wood spice, hints of mint and acidity. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Sourced from Kilikanoon's home region of Clare, this is a lush, creamy-textured Shiraz of chocolaty richness, balanced by notes of black olive, plum and mocha.

"From the only estate in Sonoma County growing the variety, this full-bodied white was aged in a combination of neutral French oak and stainless steel.

"This is a big, sweetly oaked wine notable for its ripe flavors and sheer opulence. It's distinctly Californian in the massive, rather jammy blackberries, cherries and raspberries, and shows good balance in the richness of tannins and savory acidity. Delicious as it is, it's all primary fruit now. Give it 2–3 years to mellow.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Good and smooth, with complex Napa tannins and flavors of black currants and cedar along with a firm earthy minerality that must come from the soil. A bit tannic and distant, though. Needs some time. Better after 2011, but not a longterm ager.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The lift of heady aroma precedes the pear-fruited and herbal tisane-scented nose. The palate is gentle and has that same herbal softness. The fruit is rich with residual sweetness and characterized as ripe pear. This is balanced by zesty, pleasantly bitter citrus. The effect is of harmonious, gentle and generous balance. This mature Pinot Gris is now perfectly à point. Its flavors linger long and pleasantly.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"This tightly wound wine offers firm purple fruit flavors, along with a touch of sweet berries. There's ample acidity and a slightly chalky finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A blend of 60% Sangiovese, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot, this opens with delicate aromas of black cherry jam and baking spice. The round, accessible palate offers prune and a hint of vanilla alongside rather evolved tannins. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Richly textured and full-bodied, a wine to drink now with fine steaks and chops. Almost sweet, it's opulent in cherry and raspberry jam flavors, with a decadent hint of chocolate. But it's fully dry.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Quite oaky and soft, with minty, shoe polish and lemony aromas on top of big, ripe, sweet fruit scents. The palate is sticky and leans up against medicinal, while the flavors of blackberry and plum have a mild candied, baked note to them. Just doesn't have the balance and touch of a fine Cabernet.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Red Blend
"Dried stone fruit, McIntosh apple and lemon blossom aromas lead the nose on this richly textured dessert wine. On the palate, notes of cinnamon, toasted almond and mineral add depth to candied nectarine zest and Linden honey. Refreshing acidity balances this out.",Italy-Southern Italy-Fiano
"92-94 Barrel sample. Impressively powerful wine, smothered in ripe fruit, with a velvet texture over solid tannins. Fine concentration along with great fruit.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Notes of clove, toasted nut and spicy, juniper-infused bresaola open the bouquet of this hearty effort. It sports a bright, polished, savory mouthfeel, with a distant touch of sweetness.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"A surprisingly mature-colored wine, with flavors that are of herbs, dark tannins as well as more juicy beets and dark black cherries. There is firm concentration, but the wine should be drunk now.",Austria-Burgenland-Zweigelt
"A delicious Merlot, drily tannic and rich in blackberries, cherries and chocolate. Nearly as good as the winery's much more expensive Reserve. Great with grilled steak with sautéed mushrooms.",US-California-Merlot
"Your basic everyday Zinfandel, with candied raspberry and cherry fruit, toast and pepper flavors, as well as a streak of green unripeness.",US-California-Zinfandel

"Luc de Conti's quest for perfection in wood aging white wines reaches its apogee here, a pure Sauvignon Blanc. The ripe spice, quince and lemon flavors mingle together in a powerful wine that keeps surprising elegance. Age for another year for final integration.",France-Southwest France-Sauvignon Blanc
"This recently released 2002 is still showing its youth, with a firm, mineral edge to it. But it does have the right refreshingly crisp character, along with intense fruits, and acidity that just powers right through. Wait 3–4 years.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"Faury has crafted a wonderfully quaffable Old World Syrah in '05, with scents of violets, cracked pepper and ripe blackberries, modest tannins and a crisp, clean finish. Drink now-2012. Imported by Kermit Lynch Wine Merchant.",France-Rhône Valley-Syrah
"This wine is 56% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 19% Cabernet Franc. It's aromatically brooding, with notes of high-toned dried herbs and dark cherries. The flavors are textured and palate-coating, with firm tannins backing them up. Just a baby now, it has a long life in front of it. Enjoy after 2021.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"It begins with classic brut aromas of citrus, peach and strawberry, with oak, smoke and yeast shadings. But it’s surprisingly sweet. Well made and clean, with crisp acidity and nice restraint to the fruit. But those expecting a drier wine will be disappointed.",US-New York-Champagne Blend
"This is big and strongly flavored. It has a ton of ripe, zingy apricot, mango and orange flavors wrapped into a buttery, creamy texture.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Aromas of toast, coconut and oak-driven spice lead the nose and carry over to the palate along with licorice and a confectionary note. This lacks fruit richness while raspy tannins leave an astringent finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Less jammy and forward than the '04 Elevage, but more closed and tannic than the winery's regular 2005 Cabernet, this Bordeaux blend really needs time to show its stuff. It has obviously deep and impressive currant and blackberry flavors, but the tannins are significant. Hold until at least 2010.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Full bodied, rich and carrying a bit of residual sugar, this is a fine example of the variety's potential in Marlborough. Smoky, grilled-pear notes add hints of honey and melon on the palate, where despite its richness, the wine soars into a long, velvety finish. Drink now–2020, at least.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Gris
"Beychevelle's style privileges elegance over weight, and such is the case with the 2010. It's a pure-fruited, ripe and lightly tannic wine, emphasizing a blackberry note. This will evolve relatively quickly, reaching a peak in approximately eight years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a gorgeous Cabernet Sauvignon from Sicily with intense aromas of black pepper, exotic spice, green curry leaves and chocolate fudge. It has depth and personality and would pair with succulent cuts of beef.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A firm, somewhat muscular wine, blending in 16% Merlot and aged in neutral oak barrels. Leaf and truffle notes abound, with the distinctively acidic underpinning of Sangiovese. Light strawberry-cherry fruit gently fades through a clean finish.",US-Washington-Sangiovese
"Smooth and velvety, this powerfully structured wine opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, mature plum, game, leather and just a hint of barnyard. The ripe palate doles out layers juicy blackberry, black cherry, tobacco, nutmeg and ground black pepper alongside big, velvety tannins. Hold for complexity. Drink 2018–2035.",Italy-Central Italy-Sagrantino
"Trefethen has been on a roll the last few years, producing some of Napa's most spectacular Cabernets. This bottling, which contains minor quantities of Petit Verdot and Merlot, spent 28 months in new French oak barrels. The fruit is incredibly ripe and intense, with flavors of black currants and chocolate-covered cherries. As hard as the tannins are, they must have been even more aggressive two or three years ago, so kudos to Trefethen for holding the bottle back for five years. This beauty is just now beginning its long journey. Drink now–2020.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This single vineyard wine has delicious white fruit and lime flavors. Tangy with acidity and a touch of crisp minerality, it's ready for summer drinking.",France-France Other-Jacquère
A very minty old vine Zin from organically farmed grapes that tastes of not-quite-ripe strawberry jam and is otherwise smooth and peppery.,US-California-Zinfandel
"This concentrated Merlot is blended with smaller percentages of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Syrah. Dense in black licorice and toasty oak, the fruit character is dominated by red plum and berry aromas and flavors.",US-California-Merlot
"A slightly reduced aroma unfurls from the glass, begging for more time to air before unfolding with structured layers of olive, sage and pomegranate. The acid-driven structure is noticeably lean and layered.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"There's a funky, leathery smell to this wine that's disturbing, and whatever is responsible is tamping down the flavors. It's muted in fruit, although the oak stands out. Okay with a good decant, but not going anywhere.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot, this opens with aromas of sun-baked earth, ripe plum, blue flower and a whiff of oak-driven spice. The firm palate delivers dried black cherry, anise, coconut, mocha and grilled sage alongside dusty tannins that leave a slightly astringent finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Showing the brisk acidity of this cool coastal appellation, MacMurray's '05 Pinot is bright in red and black cherry, raspberry, cola, licorice, vanilla and smoky oak flavors. The wine isn't an ager, but it's a rich, fairly complex wine to drink now. Easy to find, with 25,000 cases produced.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This vineyard is best known for its Merlot but this Cabernet keeps pace. It brings a mixture of fruit and barrel aromas of vanilla, blackberry, coffee, licorice and herbs. Flavors are sweet and rich, with coffee lingering on the finish.",US-Oregon-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Still young and nervous, this opens with aromas of resin, pressed rose petal, dark berry and a whiff of coffee. The tightly packed palate offers a ripe black cherry core backed up by notes of sage and anise. It's still tense, with youthfully assertive tannins that need to loosen up. Drink 2018–2025.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Hot, soft and uninteresting. It's not a bad wine, being clean and somewhat dry, but that softness results in a serious absence of structure, and there's not enough fruity essence to compensate.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Gorgeous and smooth, this elegant, 10-year-old red boasts aromas of new leather, tilled soil and pipe tobacco. The polished and structured palate delivers creamy black cherry, star anise and clove framed in refined tannins. It's a remarkable performance for what was an extremely hot vintage. Best through 2023.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Crushed violet, red berry, mint and menthol aromas lead the nose. The firm palate offers dried red cherry, raw strawberry, licorice, white pepper and sage alongside grippy tannins that leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unclench then enjoy before the remaining fruit fades.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
Here's a clean expression of Barbera with sweet cherry and blackberry aromas followed by notes of cinnamon and crushed clove. The grape's naturally sharp acidity has been tamed thanks to 12 months of oak aging.,Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"It's difficult to name favorites amidst this vintage of Huber's Pinot Noirs, but the Schlossberg is distinct for its plump, ripe fruit. The palate penetrates with bright red-cherry flavor, yet maintains composure. A vibrant vein of acidity trails through the finish.",Germany-Baden-Spätburgunder
"Very fresh and fruity, this wine from the north end of the Côte de Nuits has tight acidity and plenty of raspberry fruit, fragrant and perfumed. It should be ready to drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Made from certified organic fruit, this impressively dark and tannic bottling is essentially the second wine of Huia. Dark cherries and vanilla finish firm. Drink it now with grilled meats, or hold it until 2018–2019 and see how it develops in the cellar.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"A blend of Sangiovese, Merlot, Syrah and other grapes, this features aromas of bright berry, spice and violet. The vibrant, easy-drinking palate offers black cherry, red currant and black pepper alongside supple tannins and fresh acidity.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Cherry-vanilla cola aromas meet sweet brown spice notes on the nose. Medium-bodied on the palate, with nice roundness, sweet cherry and darker shades of plum carry to a clean vanilla finish.",US-Virginia-Meritage
"Almost indistinguishable from its companion Horse Heaven Vineyard bottling, the Columbia Valley Sauvignon Blanc also clocks in at a modest 12.5% alcohol. It offers light, succinct, pure varietal flavors, on the cool side with green apple, peavine, and a bracing minerality.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine boasts a lovely, creamy texture and citrusy freshness enhanced by deep concentration. Along with the citrus you'll find apple, pear and melon fruitiness. This is an irresistible summer sipper.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"This is an architectural wine, very classical in its structure like so many of the top wines of 2010. It's powered by ripe tannins and beautiful black currant fruits. While the wine is gorgeously ripe, it also has a powerful dark and structured character. For long-term aging.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"It's a ripe wood-aged wine, showing a full body, dark plum flavors and generous tannins. It is maturing well, giving plenty of ripe fruits along with spice and a solid tannic aftertaste.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Raspingly dry and fierce in tannins, this Merlot is quite different from other Bordeaux-style red wines from Oakville that are ripe and lush. Doesn't offer much reward now due to the astringency, but has a solid core of blackberries. Hard to know if the fruit will outlast the tannins.",US-California-Merlot
"Scents of pine pitch, tomato, smashed kalamata olive and wild berry combine for a clove-soaked punch experience. Spice hits the palate hard, with oregano, thyme, sagebrush and more pine, set against strong tannins as well. Lay this one down for additional development and maturity, and try after 2018.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Intense flavors of mango, melon and apricot lead on this lively but rich dessert. The palate is bursting with flavor but layered spice softens and adds depth. The sweetness is enhanced by a pretty floral character that lingers through the finish. Imported by Wine Emporium.",Canada-Ontario-Riesling
"Aromas of spice cake, dark plum, black tea and dried red rose characterize this austere Aglianico del Vulture. The wine has impressive thickness and succulence but also offers ethereal notes of tar, resin and old spice. Pair it with lamb couscous or any meat dish with curry or cumin seasonings.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico

"This is technically dry, but rich in sweet flavor—like a gingerbread cookie. There's also a lot of tangerine and pear fruit. The acidity is just fine, giving the richness a bracing quality. Try pairing this with a lightly sugared fruit tart, although it should also go with a vast range of foods, especially Asian fare.",US-California-Gewürztraminer
"Here's a luminous red that opens with red berry, sun-baked soil and Mediterranean herb aromas. It's medium-bodied and approachable, delivering wild cherry, star anise and clove flavors, supported by polished tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Golden in color, with a nose of gardenia, green herb and lychee. This feels solid, but it's softening, with adequate grip despite no overt acidity. It tastes peachy and oily. Drink immediately.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Torrontés
"Welcoming bubblegum, key lime, grass and cement aromas check many Sauvignon Blanc boxes in this widely available and reliable bottling. The palate leads with decent structure, but then ripeness prevails, with peach and more bubblegum notes.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Peach and pear flavors give a rich feel to this warm wine. It has vanilla and cream flavors, with a citrus character that cuts through the ripeness on the finish. Ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A blend of Grenache (65%), Mourvèdre (25%) and Syrah, this suggests peppery spices, stewed raspberries, game and high-toned spices. The palate is the star, full bodied, textured and richly flavored. An orange peel accent leads to a warm finish.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"On the nose, high-toned pineapple and tropical fruit dominate Casa Larga's Gewürz. The palate is refreshing but simple with lots of apple juice flavors laced with a hint of wax and jasmine blossoms.",US-New York-Gewürztraminer
"There are some elegant floral highlights in the nose, leading into a fairly substantial mouthful of mixed citrus, apricot and peach fruit. Bigger than most Oregon Pinot Blancs, this has a round, fruity flavor with a hint of sweetness.",US-Oregon-Pinot Blanc
"Alluring scents of orchard fruit, nut and lemon drop lead the nose on this blend of Pinot Bianco, Friulano and Malvasia. The bright palate shows chopped herb, yellow apple, herb and mineral alongside vibrant acidity. A hint of almond signals the finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend
"Posh fruit aromas, gentle and ripe flavors and a very polished texture make this wine more fun to drink now than its big sister, the Ferrington single-vineyard Pinot. Delicious red cherry, cinnamon and cedar threads weave a complex and layered flavor, with a good underpinning of fine-grained tannins.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Vanilla, toast and stone-fruit aromas are followed by light, elegantly styled flavors that show persistence. It comes off as a bit faint but what's there is pleasing.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"This opens with white flower, yellow stone fruit and honeydew melon aromas. The fruity sensations carry over to the palate, with a tangerine zest note and tangy acidity that leads to a juicy finish.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
Maple and sweet spice aromas are followed by medium-bodied fruit and barrel flavors. Baking-spice flavors linger on the finish. The oak stands out.,US-Washington-Tempranillo
"Strong in oak and ripe fruit, this tastes overworked. It's dominated by buttered toast, butterscotch and pineapple jam flavors. It will satisfy legions of Chardonnay lovers who like this popular style.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Intensely mineral in character, with a real feel for the stony soil, this is a tight, taut wine that reveals layers of fresh pink grapefruit and green plum flavors along with sufficient ripeness to give a rounder aftertaste. But the wine does need 3–4 years' aging at least. Screwcap.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"This polished, structured white opens with intense aromas of yellow peach, passion fruit, dried hay and crushed tomato vine. The linear, vibrant palate delivers juicy nectarine, creamy white peach and green melon. It's balanced, with refreshing acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"This is a soft, muddled and somewhat green wine, with sizable tannins and an earthy element of wet tobacco that will require strongly flavored food to enjoy.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"An ambitious blend of Merlot, Tempranillo, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, grown mainly on Atlas Peak. It's bone dry and locked down in tannins and acidity, offering little relief, but there's a potent core of blackberries and black currants that yearns to bust through. Clearly well grown, it could be an ager, but predictions are risky.",US-California-Red Blend
"This structured wine has a strong mineral element. With black-currant and berry flavors, it is firm and still young. Swathes of rich fruit are sustained by solid tannins. Drink from late 2017.",Portugal-Dão-Portuguese Red
"This Roero Riserva boasts a light, elegant appearance with defined aromas of citrus zest, pressed flowers and wild blueberries. The tight, drying tannins would pair well with aged cheese or creamy sauces.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
The volatiles are quite amped on this wine. It makes it a struggle to get at the tart black cherry flavors.,US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A softly earthy tone is all the nose gives away. The palate is brisk, neutral and has both freshness and a slightly bitter edge. Drink soon.",France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"Picking up just a tad of spice from the 2% Syrah addition, this offers aromas of freshly tanned leather, blackberry jam and mint-laced coffee. The palate is all about gripping tannins, cigar ash and tart cherry skins, proving quite extracted but certain to improve with a bit of patience and mellowing.",US-California-Mourvèdre
"Swathes of freshly cut herbs and blossom perfume zesty grapefruit and honeydew flavors in this dry, deftly balanced wine. Bracing acidity invigorates and amplifies its crystalline demeanor, extending a long, mineral finish. It drinks well now, but should improve through 2025.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Produced by vintner Fernando Campagnola, this shows a touch of apple skin as well as aromas of raspberry, currant and sweet tobacco. The finish is sweet and succulent, with a hint of candied almond on the close.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This wine is made from grapes grown at the Hop Kiln Vineyard in the Russian River Valley, a project of BR Cohn winemaker Tom Montgomery and winemaker Melissa Smith. It's Chardonnay-like in its grasp of green apple and generosity of toasted oak, medium bodied with a burst of ripe peach.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"Multicastas, or many grape varieties, holds a blend of five grapes. It's a young, fruity wine that has ripe tannins and a soft texture, but still manages a dry core. It would be good to drink now for its fruit, but will be better from 2016.",Portugal-Península de Setúbal-Portuguese Red
"Firm and tart, this is a rather light, earthy, herbal take on the grape. Its blueberry and blue plum suggestions are bound in an unyielding frame, with a whiff of rubber ball on the nose.",US-Oregon-Syrah
"This is a nice Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now with ethnic fare, from Mexican to Vietnamese and Ethiopian. Its acidic citrus flavors will brighten and heighten richly sauced chicken dishes, .",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is Drouhan's second vintage of handling the vines, wines and marketing in partnership with the Hospices de Belleville charity. This open generous wine is packed with ripe red fruit and given shape by light tannins. There is a fresh crisp aftertaste that gives the wine a great lift.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Aromas of leafy underbrush, steeped prune and a whiff of dark kitchen spice lead the nose. The dense palate offers dried black cherry, raisin and licorice alongside tightly packed, drying tannins.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Espresso, toast, new leather, menthol and French oak aromas take center stage. The firm palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and sage alongside tightly knit fine-grained tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Mushroom aromas signify the maturity of this wine. It is now smooth, ripe and rich, while also very dry. Firm tannins are integrated, allowing plenty of room for the black fruits to register. There is no need further to age this juicy wine.",France-Southwest France-Tannat
"This herbal, lightly earthy wine coveys aromas like thyme and parsley, but takes several minutes to open up. Flavors are subtle and citrusy and the texture smooth, with medium body.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Mild and approachable up front, with apple, banana and tropical fruit aromas. Feels fresh and about average, with sweet, candied flavors of mango and melon. Turns slightly bitter and pithy on the finish.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Chardonnay
"Stalky berry and leather aromas settle on rustic and rubbery. This has a staunch, acidic feel and stalky, bushy flavors of plum and berry. Chocolate flavors rise up on a rubbery, slightly harsh finish. The blend holds 70% Garnacha and 30% Carignan.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"This is a crisp and deliciously tangy wine from a single parcel. Full of lemon and fresh apple flavors, it is bright with acidity. Produced from vines over 35 years old, it has a good concentration of fruit and ripeness. Drink from 2016.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"The vintage has given a rich wine, one that is still young. Over the wood notes are ripe yellow fruits, orange marmalade and intense acidity. Age this concentrated wine for 2–3 years.",France-Southwest France-Petit Manseng
"A smoky, charred oak aroma leads the nose of this full-bodied, high-octane and appropriately tannic wine, and vivid, peppery notes jazz up its solid fruit flavors.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Even tasted blind, this wine comes across as a bit warm. The 15% alcohol imparts a thick, rich consistency in the mouth, while the flavors stay true to the site, showing notes of ripe peaches, citrus and hints of home heating oil. It's certainly impressive, but the alcohol shows through a bit on the finish, suggesting near-term consumption.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Aged partly in concrete vats and partly in oak, this shows concentrated sensations of ripe plum, sour cherry and raspberry layered with espresso notes. Pair this with grilled vegetables or spicy cheeses.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This wine is more structured, tannic and textural than many, and shows the sophisticated personality of a dry wine that still has plenty of ripe flavors. It smells and tastes like wild blackberries dusted with cinnamon. Drink now through 2020.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Earthy aromas of underbrush, tobacco leaf, truffle and red berries take center stage in this intense blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo/Colorino. The palate delivers succulent black cherry, mint and menthol sprinkled with toasted notes and espresso. It has structure and finesse alongside gripping, tongue-drying tannins.

"Big, tight and tannic, this is a full-fledged dinner wine that needs to pair with a nice caloric veal shank or lasagna. It's made with 80% Syrah, so the color is almost black, the aromas are spicy and smoky and the flavors feature black cherry, espresso and dark chocolate. The texture is both mouth filling and a bit astringent due to hefty tannins.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"The storied Carneros producer dips a toe into Oregon with this new release. It's got ample herbal aromatics and bright, brambly berry fruit, with cinnamon-stick highlights. Quite young and tight, it has a few rough edges to be smoothed out with additional bottle age. This will drink best from 2020–2025.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
The nose is reticent but reveals glimpses of passion fruit and peach. These are intensified by honeyed richness on the concentrated palate. Flavors are luscious and round but tangy notes of grapefruit zest give tension and ease to this richness. The finish is all about freshness despite being medium sweet. The peach lasts and lasts.,France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Quite a success for a California Sangiovese. It's dry and silky, with light tannins and a good crunch of acidity to brighten the cherry pie, anise and pepper flavors.",US-California-Sangiovese
"This lower alcohol-style wine from the biodynamic-minded producer shows cranberry, orange rinds, chaparral scrub, dried oregano and a mix of green and kalamata olives on the nose. It's very savvy on the palate, with minced parsley, olive tapenade, cracked peppercorns and caper berries, all framed by mouth-watering acidity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant mixture with 11% Cabernet Franc, 3% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec, this powerfully generous wine has a thread of classic black olive and dried herb that provides a restrained edge. Tightly woven tannin and oak give added strength and structure.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Noticeably herbal, this Cabernet, a good deal at its price point, is rich and the right call for midweek pizza or other casual fare.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This unoaked Chardonnay shows admirable weight on the palate, but slightly one-dimensional, citrusy flavors. Clean and correct on the finish; drink now.",Australia-Australia Other-Chardonnay
"Made with Sangiovese and 3% Cabernet Sauvignon, it opens with aromas of plum, berry, spice, leather and a hint of toast. The palate holds fleshy black cherry accented with notes of cinnamon and clove alongside aggressive, dusty tannins that overwhelm the finish. It closes on a drying note.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This wine is made in a full-throttle style, with aromas of toast, melted butter, spice and vanilla—the latter from the 100% new American oak aging. It's creamy in feel, with citrus and stone-fruit flavors on the finish. The barrel influence is a bit obvious but it's hard to deny its appeal.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Total fruity freshness emanates from the glass: fresh Conference pear, lemon zest and a riper notion of yellow mirabelle plum. This is utterly appetizing. The palate adds a dimension of pepper and a broader notion of yeast in the texture. This blooms with fruit and finishes on clean lemon zest and white pepper.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"The perfumed scent of ripe, red-cheeked Mirabelle plums is joined by some lovely bitter notes of fir honey. The palate shows the typical 2014 freshness, adding passion fruit, pear peel, honeycomb and grapefruit pith to this aromatic tableau. In between, seams of pepper and honeysuckle are highlighted by bright, zesty acidity. The wine offers an irresistible contradiction of structure and enthusiasm.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
This attractively crisp wine packed with red berry fruits is light and lively. It offers plenty of acidity along with a touch of pepper and cinnamon. Drink now.,France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"No doubt: This is a beautiful wine. The blend pairs Pinot Nero (80%) with Chardonnay and the end result is rich, deep and penetrating. You'll recognize tones of ripe peach, pink rose, pomegranate and freshly baked baguette.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sparkling Blend
"Dão's local Alfrocheiro grape gives the intense color to this wine that also has Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz. The combination is a powerful, rich wine offering solid tannins and equally full black fruits. The wood aging is still showing strongly, so this wine needs to age. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Dão-Portuguese Red
"This likable wine smells sweet and plummy. It tastes smooth, juicy and fruity, as red cherry and black-plum flavors spill over the palate. Pleasantly medium bodied, it's moderate in tannins.",US-California-Carignane

"The wine comes from a small strip of a half acre in the center of this famed grand cru, part of the Olivier Leflaive family domaine. It is laden with toast flavors from the wood fermentation as well as intense fruit, green plums and crisp apples which are given extra richness by apricots. Concentrated and densely textured the wine will develop so well. Drink from 2022.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Here's a well-balanced Vernaccia with good fruit freshness backed by a dense, creamy consistency and good crispness. It also offers mineral and herbal notes and would pair well with salmon or swordfish.",Italy-Tuscany-Vernaccia

"As the name makes clear, this wine is made from a head-pruned, older block of very unlikely Syrah at the estate property, as seductive as rare. Plum, black cherry, leather and black pepper jump from the glass, slowly and with purpose, around a core of burly tannin and intensely floral aromatics. This is a great wine.",US-California-Syrah
"Snappy black raspberry and fresh plum combine for an almost effervescent experience on the nose, which also benefits from smoked beef and carnation aromas. The palate is also very energetic with black-plum and orange-juice flavors, finishing with strong acidity. This will last for years, but needs at least another year to fully integrate.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"If you like yours big and burly, then this might be the right wine for you. Applesauce and lemon meringue pie aromas lead the way toward a palate full of lemon, pineapple, tangerine and vanilla. The finish is stony and leaves a custard-like impression. It's clearly from the barrel-fermented school, but for some that may be fine. For others, however, it will feel overoaked and ponderous on the tongue.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"A hard, tough, tannic and acidic wine. Not showing much charm, because the cherry-berry flavors, while dry, are swamped with astringency. Zinfandel and Teroldego.",US-California-Red Blend
"Well-balanced, ripe and toasty, it has all the elements in the right place. It's rich, packed with spice, apricot and red apple fruits given a creamy texture by the wood aging. The wine could benefit by waiting until 2015, although it's delicious now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Stone flint and smoke join a lovely combination of superripe orange and juicy mandarin. The palate focuses even more on these luscious juicy citrus flavors. It gets direction from gentle but definite lemon freshness. With a little air, an earthier aspect grounds this beautifully and gives a three-dimensional picture of aroma, flavor and texture with immense and intense length.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"Bouscassé is the home estate of Alain Brumont, who also owns Château Montus. The wine may be six years old, but it is still dark and very firm. Dense tannins still show strongly over the tarry black fruits. Just wait and this wine will reveal its richness and smoothness while never losing concentration. Drink from 2018.",France-Southwest France-Red Blend
"Still very young with its tannins dominant, this will nevertheless be a richly fruity wine as it develops. The black fruits are all there, along with licorice and bitter chocolate. Final acidity brings a lift to the dense texture.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"A nicely made and easy to like kind of young Ribera red with clean, bold blackberry aromas and flavors that fit the wine's big, tannic structure. Composed on the back palate and beefy on the finish. Perfect for grilled meats. Drink now through 2012.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Ayala specializes in dry Champagnes and this is their extreme example. It has the right amount of bottle age to soften the intense acidity and bring in some toastiness and fruit. It can be drunk now, but a few more months in bottle would make it even better.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Weighty and dry, Albariño is a rare sight in Sonoma. This one is well worth seeking, savory in nutty almond and a taste of grilled peach. Mouth quenching, it'll pair well with spicy Thai shrimp.",US-California-Albariño
"This Tempranillo's red berry jam and oak aromas lean savory and saucy. On the palate, lip-smacking, tomato-like acidity sends a jolt through plum, currant and oak spice flavors, the oak lingering on the finish. Drink over the next 15 years.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Nutty almond aromas open this wine, along with a wave of white flower and herb scents. Light in color, it's exuberant with crisp acidity and delicate apricot and peach flavors, finishing clean and focused.",US-California-Viognier
"A freshly perfumed wine, very flowery, structured with minerality and freshened by yellow peaches, dried apricots and tight acidity. To drink now, but could age a few more months in bottle.",Austria-Kamptal-Riesling
"Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, this reserve comes from a three-acre block of an estate vineyard. Dark, fleshy plum and soft, supple tannins give it a fruit-tinged structure and lushness, alongside plenty of full-bodied chocolate, tobacco and a hint of mint.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The aromas are light, with mineral, crushed flowers, savory notes, smoked meat, black pepper and embers. The palate is restrained and pretty in style, showing a sense of balance that runs from head to tail, with plenty of length on the finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Ripe and fruity, this is a full-bodied, intense wine. It has citrus acidity as well as more tropical fruits, laden with wood. The whole is much more than the sum of the parts, giving a full, ripe and complex wine that will age.",Portugal-Dão-Encruzado
"This is a perfumed wine with violet aromas and a fragrant character. It has soft plum and cherry flavors, its acidity shaped by ripe fruits. There is a touch of structure that provides a fine finish.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"One can make the argument that in 2005, Martinet Bru, Mas Martinet's “second” wine, is every bit as good and quite a bit more approachable than Clos Martinet. This wine is entirely solid and free of holes. It shows deep, ripe cassis and berry flavors along with chocolaty richness and accents of sage and herbs. Drink now through 2012. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Lifted notes of Conference pear blended with creamy, balmy aloe vera create an intriguing, friendly and inviting nose, while a pleasantly bitter edge suggests some grapefruit zest. The palate is zingy, sprightly and fresh, almost belying the concentrated power at its base. Texturally this is a pleasure too, with a wonderfully ripe phenolic edge.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"The wine comes from vineyards on the plateau above the village of Vouvray. It is a ripe, lemon and honey-flavored wine with balanced acidity that creates a clean, crisp, perfumed and fruity aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"This fresh, simple white smells of white wild flower and yellow stone fruit. The zesty palate offers lime and Bosc pear alongside tangy acidity that leads to a clean finish.",Italy-Central Italy-Verdicchio
"Made with 80% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot and 10% Canaiolo, this opens with subtle aromas of blue flower and baking spice. On the fresh palate, teeth-coating tannins support wild cherry and white pepper. Drink through 2016.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"A fine effort, with an inviting swirl of earthy components. Citrus, spice, earth, compost, coffee grounds and cinnamon comprise this detailed, aromatic wine. It sits squarely in the classic mold of the better Walla Walla Syrahs.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Fresh cracked peppercorn, dense black and purple fruit and a cedar tone carry through the nose of this lavish yet nuanced bottling from a South Coast winery that practices extended aging before release. The elderberry fruit is hung on a strong tannic structure, bolstered by woody cigar box, incense, juniper and espresso flavors.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Kiwi, peach and pineapple mark this blend of 93% Sauvignon Blanc and 7% Sémillon, providing a tropical character and personality. Medium in body and weight, it finishes moderately influenced by oak and a touch of vanilla cream.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Powerful, very rich and very concentrated, this epitomizes the opulent style of Cos d'Estournel. A sense of extraction is overwhelmed by the huge, ripe fruit. It shows velvet texture at first, but then the tannins come on strongly, leaving a wine that will age over many years. Drink from 2022.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"With an abundance of deep black-cherry, molasses and leather aromas, this is dynamite in terms of intensity and concentration. In the mouth, it's smooth and stylish, with a tight black-fruit core and a suave finish. Built like a house with a very dark interior; it'll be alive and kicking through 2008.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Very dry and rather sharp in fruit-skin acidity, with a tart bite to the cherries, cola and licorice. A good, rustic wine for drinking now.",US-California-G-S-M
"Aromas of Sherry and barrel resin are all you get from this wood-fermented, oxidized number. While neither foul nor severe, the all-wood nature of this is overly dominant and not pleasant enough to stand on its own.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"In a medium sweet style, the wine has a light prickle and fine citrus acidity to balance the soft freshness. It is a refreshing wine, totally drinkable immediately.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White
"This well-made wine is powered by lush red and black fruits and berries. The acids keep it lively and fresh, tannins are polished and the outstanding fruit is a real joy. It's unfiltered and aged in French oak, 50% new.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This opens with a blast of berry fruit and a note of spice. It feels bouncy, full and healthy, with black fruits and dark spices comprising the flavor profile. The finish is short, but fruity and clean.",Spain-Central Spain-Tempranillo
"Muscular tannins nearly mask raspberry and cherry notes in this structured red. The juicy palate leads to a fairly long, earthy finish. Drink with pepperoni and sausage pizza.",Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto
"This dry wine has an appealing fruit character, light spiciness and a firm grip of tannin. It will pair well with roast birds or grilled sausages.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Shows a rich blend of citrus and stone fruits on the nose and on the palate, easily combining grapefruit, passion fruit and nectarines into a cohesive package. Finishes long, with tangy, lip-smacking acids that beg you to give this wine some time in the cellar. It's tasty now, but should be better in 2005.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend
"Passion fruit and melon vie for attention on the bouquet with grassy, vegetal, herbaceous scents. In the mouth, citrus and dry Asian pear flavors intermingle with additional grassy, asparagus tones. The acids on the back end are intense, so the tang and zip on the finish is powerful. The biggest problem here is a persistent vegetal quality that won't let up.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"This fruity fizz majors on the aroma of freshly cut Golden Delicious apples, while the body is very light, slightly tart and pleasantly dry. The mousse is rather frothy but if refreshment is what you are after, this is your ticket.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"Pineapple, sulfur and matchstick, and finally some woody toast steer the bouquet. The palate is big and blowsy, with toasty baked apple and pineapple flavors. Finishes sweet, with honey and a sprinkle of white pepper. Yet another sweet, resiny, basic Chardonnay from Chile.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"Soft and simple, with herb-infused blackberry, cherry, cola, beef jerky and pepper flavors. Finishes dry and nicely spicy, but needs greater structure, especially at this price.",US-California-Syrah
"Time has not tamed this in-your-face, oaky, high-octane Syrah, which on the label says it's also known as “rasta red.” The wine is very tannic, smelling of earth and tar and sticky caramel and could use a touch more fruitiness to give it a lift. Do not attempt to drink without a sauce-slathered side of beef.",US-California-Syrah
"Fonseca uses its Guimaraens brand in years when there is no general vintage declaration. Even so, the wine has all the broad, ripe and generous character that is so typical of Fonseca. It is packed with rich black fruits that are enveloped by the structured tannins and never-too-sweet character. It obviously needs to age; drink from 2025.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Crisp and sturdy at this young stage, with a lot of green on the nose: apple, onion, melon, even celery. For a Maule Valley SB, this one manages to maintain freshness and liveliness. There's give and take between the wine's acidity and body, with apple, green herb and talc for flavors. Finishes clean and chalky.",Chile-Maule Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
Smoky notes of mesquite and teriyaki are blended nicely with delicate berry notes and a drying mineral feel. This is a classic and subdued Nebbiolo that would pair with veal scallopini enhanced by a drop of truffle oil.,Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This unusual blend marries Grenache, Pinot Noir and Malbec—in other words, Rhône, Burgundy and Bordeaux. None of the three is dominant, and the result is a pretty wine, with light raspberry fruit, and highlights of toast and coffee.",US-Oregon-Red Blend
"A savory, masculine nose of black currant, cloves and spice lead into flavors of black fruit, spiced sausage and toast in this sexy Cabernet. Flavors are meaty, spicy but soft. Balanced but has a plucky, spicy backbone. Pair with lamb, steak, savory dishes.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A very pretty and polished Pinot Noir, soft, silky and delicious, and lovely for drinking now. It shows raspberry, cherry, vanilla and cinnamon flavors, with a kiss of rose petal.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Plump tannins and ripe black cherry mark this wine, the structure and savory components also standing out. The finish carries a suggestion of cinnamon spice.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"There is some good bottle age with this nonvintage Brut. The wine is soft, just toasty, with almond and spicy pear flavors. In the mouth, it is quite tight, a crisp, but one-dimensional wine, with a well-balanced aftertaste.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This shows the problems of overripe fruit that plagued many 2009s. It is soft, giving the impression of sweetness, with the structure vastly understated. Juicy and fruity, this is ready to drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Vibrant and bright with wild berry and white cherry, this expression of Sangiovese (with small percentages of Canaiolo, Colorino and Malvasia Nera) shows the trademark acidity you can expect of this region.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This 90% Sangiovese, 5% Merlot and 5% Colorino blend opens with aromas that recall forest floor, dark berry and a whiff of toast. On the palate, notes of ground pepper, anise and cocoa accent a core of black cherry while firm, fine-grained tannins provide support. Drink through 2017.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Fragrant, tender notes of ripe Conference pear on the nose are met with fresh grapefruit zest on the palate ,which also conveys scented citrus foliage. It's a balanced, elegant Riesling with a dry finish.",France-Alsace-Riesling
The reserve version of this wine has extra richness and concentration. Solid tannins are filled out with ripe juicy blackberry fruits and perfumed acidity. The wine is concentrated and could age for a few more months. Drink from 2017.,Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This is a light, compact Roero Riserva (made with Nebbiolo grapes) that shows drying tannins and sharp aromas of wild berry, citrus zest and white almond.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Neutral up front except for green apple and mineral aromas. Feels quite good and healthy, with juicy acids pushing fresh bell pepper, lime and white peach flavors. Short but fresh and citrusy on the finish.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Now winemaker for Swanson, Robin Ackhurst excels here in this tiny production of his own wine, which exhibits exotic plum and juicy blackberry. A 100% varietal offering, it has a girth of structured tannin and toasty oak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"For a 100% Chardonnay, this is remarkably complex. It shows orange, lime, vanilla, toast and sourdough flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. The mousse is very refined, giving it a mouthfeel of pure silk. Try giving it 5–6 years in the cellar.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Aromas of mesquite, smoke, strawberry, freesia and herbs are followed by quite light fruit flavors. The concentration seems wanting.",US-Washington-Pinot Noir
"Chalky, intensely mineral aromas stand out in contrast to the plush, intensely fruity palate of this Cabernet Franc rosé. Slightly off dry in style, its black plum and cherry flavors are voluptuously rich and ripe, accented by fresh cranberry acidity.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"Melon, citrus and herb notes are well balanced in this pleasing, refreshing, light wine. Bright and fresh to the end, it's perfect for summer quaffing.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aged for 30 months in French and American oak (90% new), this wine brings pleasing notes of café au lait, pencil lead, cashew and woodspice. Rich coffee and chocolate flavors are backed by a silky feel, with the wood playing prominent role.",US-Washington-Merlot
"From a replanted single vineyard, single clone site, the first vintage since that replanting in 2009, there's a youthful awkwardness still at play here, though the wine is quite juicy in black cherry and a lingering suggestion of soy. The oak and tannin are fairly firm and pronounced.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of vanilla, coconut and wood spice lead to wood-filled flavors. The barrel notes are in complete control.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Impressively juicy waves of cranberry and black tea underlie a light, earthy and ethereal wine from a well-known vineyard known for its meticulous farming. Dried herbs and roses add to the complexity and savory nature of this beauty.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a fruity wine, full of red-berry flavors and with some smoky tannins in the background. It is balanced between the wood aging and the berry and red-cherry fruitiness. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of grilled herb, dark spice and mature black-skinned fruit lead the nose. The ripe, generous palate doles out succulent black cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and nutmeg alongside round, velvety tannins. Drink through 2020.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Medium-weight, with a touch of apparent sweetness, this tart-apple and lime-scented wine should prove versatile at the table. Pair it with anything from wursts and kraut to Thai dishes.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Riesling
"Yeasty aromas give way to a ripe, plump palate. Varietally typical phenolic richness is kept in check by acidity.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"There's an initial intense citrus character to this wine, a product of its youth. But then the freshness is enriched by the pear and green apple flavors, lifted by lively acidity. There are some almond and peach flavors to give an exotic touch to this superb wine that could age for a decade or more.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Old vines in the quinta have produced a fine wine from a great Douro year. The tannins, although softened, are still there giving licorice flavors while supporting powerful black fruits. The only downside to this otherwise important wine is the touch of pepper that comes from the alcohol. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This beloved annual bottling by Randall Grahm blends 39% Mourvèdre, 33% Grenache, 26% Syrah and 2% Cinsaut to create a very savory, Old World-style expression, with aromas of roasted game, pencil shavings, dried red fruits and blood. The palate is very iron-rich and rustic, with uncrushed black peppercorns and raw and dried meat flavors.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is young of course, but the creamy richness makes it attractive even at this early stage. As it fills out, the more complex acidity and mineral texture will come forward. Drink now for the fruit, or wait until 2016 for a more complex wine.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"The spicy aroma and burnt toast character of this young wine reflects its strong wood aging. The black fruit is right behind though, likely to break through the dry surface over the next few months. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Raisiny aromas lack freshness and lift. Following that lead, this Cabernet feels stewy and heavy, with questionable balance. Herbal flavors of stewed plum and tomato finish chunky and choppy.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend comes with a deep, minerally aroma as well as with lush black-fruit, herb and spice notes. The feel is plump and smooth, while the core flavors are of blackberry, tobacco, raw oak and spice. It's predominantly round and ripe, but there's more than enough crispness and tannic bite to keep things framed.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Red Blend
"Smoked red-cherry and pomegranate-juice aromas show on the sip of this appellation blend. The palate shows fruit punch with touches of lavender and vanilla, which tastes good altogether, even though it is not very complex.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A firm and solid wine, tightly packed with tannins, black berry fruits and a dense structure. Laurence is Laurence Helfrich whose family owns the chateau. The wine could age for several years, but will be ready to drink in 2014.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is bulky on the nose, with meaty, rubbery aromas. It feels more snappy and acidic on the tongue, with zesty acids pushing tomato, red plum and herb flavors. Long and steady on the finish, with additional tomato-based tang.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"Feathery, lifted notes of citrus, lemon zest and leaf announce a lightness of touch. Some topnotes of chamomile tisane swing alongside. The palate is fresh, taut, dry and light-footed. Deeper notions of fruit are still just hinted at, a core of fruit that still takes time before it is unlocked. Purity and elegance mark this one out.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Serious spice, black currant and herb flavors combine with firm tannins to produce a wine that is both structured and age worthy. Made from grapes sourced from the Deutschkreutz region of central Burgenland, this should be kept for another year. Screwcap.",Austria-Burgenland-Blaufränkisch
"This is basically the same as Gloria's brut, only they added some Muscat and made it a little sweeter. With sugared raspberry, lime, orange and brioche flavors, made brisk with acidity, it will satisfy those who like some plumpness in their sparkling wines.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"This is a beautiful Sauvignon Blanc that has the aromatic intensity and crispness expected from the best expressions of the variety. Background tones of citrus, herb and spicy ginger add personality and overall momentum.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a ripe, wood-aged wine that shows the richer side of Meursault. It's generous with ripe yellow fruits, but balanced and complemented by crisp acidity and hints of toastiness. A fine wine with impeccable structure, it will age well, so drink from 2015.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"The results of a partnership between Golan Heights Winery's Chief Winemaker Victor Schoenfeld and world-renowned winemaker and consultant Zelma Long, Rom (meaning “summit” in Hebrew) is a reference and tribute to the culmination of their relationship. The inaugural effort is a gorgeous wine composed of 37% Syrah, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon and 29% Merlot aged in French oak for 21 months. The result is a powerful, lush and concentrated wine loaded with black raspberry, blueberry, thin mint cookies and savory spice. Full weight with forward tannins and medium acidity, this is an Old World wine with a New World attitude.",Israel-Galilee-Red Blend
"Inky black in color, this is the top wine from Apegadas, a big, chunky wine that is characterized by dark tannins, bold berry fruits, sweet plums, but also a serious, more austere character to allow it to age. The final fruit is richly juicy. Age 3–4 years.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Mildly pickled red-fruit aromas fail to convey freshness or ripeness, and so it's no surprise that the core flavors are a bit herbal and briney. Decent mouthfeel helps it along, while the finish is short and borders on medicinal.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Toasty oak kicks off the nose of this bottling, and then come touches of vanilla, lemon cookie, flint, buttered toast and almost marshmallow. Flavors are quite smoky, with roasted almond and sea salt, but the grippy texture is the most intriguing part.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A deep pink or coral color, strong fruit and herb aromas and equally strong, dry fruit flavors call for something rich and spicy to pair with, like sausage and mustard or pulled pork sandwiches.",US-California-Rosé
"This is aged four years prior to release, which proves a benefit here, as it helps tame the spicy wild-berry flavors. The aromatics offer an olfactory tapestry of orange peel, violets, sandalwood, cherry cola and more. It's balanced and sophisticated, offering many subtle pleasures.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Brisk acidity contributes just what this jammy wine needs. The white peach, tangerine, Meyer lemon and oak flavors have a honeyed sweetness that would be cloying without that tart finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The charity Hospices of Belleville owns the land as part of its foundation, with the wines being made by Beaune negociant Joseph Drouhin. This wine is attractively fruity and soft. With its red-cherry and lightly spiced flavors, which are cut with acidity, it has a fine balanced texture, finishing with bright red-fruit acidity. Drink now.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Juicy ripe blackberry and raspberry form the basis of this brambly, fruit-forward Zin that offers a low output of tannin and oak presence. Refined on the palate, it finishes with a swat of wild licorice and dried herb.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Very broad but also complete and elegant aromas show on this bottling, including Asian pear, yellow apple, Meyer lemon, wet stone and a touch of browned butter. The mouthfeel is very tense though not overly sharp in acidity, with lemon and key lime citrus. That tension holds deep into the sip.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A vibrantly aromatic wine, with notes of petrol, marmalade, citrus and flowers. It's rich and honeyed, with a lightly smoky, lingering finish.",Canada-Ontario-Riesling
"A noteworthy effort made in widely available commercial quantities, Guigal's '07 CdR Blanc offers scents of pineapple and pear, flavors that include hints of white chocolate, a reasonably rich mouthfeel and a long, dry, concentrated finish with just a hint of honey.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style White Blend
"Despite this estate remaining among the top echelon of New Zealand Riesling producers, Framingham's Pinot Noir is solid but unexciting. It's plump and medium bodied, and it offers modest cherry fruit and a touch of bitterness on the finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"The core aromas of blackberry and dark cherry are detailed with touches of catnip, black tea and mocha. Medium in body, this wine has bright acidity and fine, chalky tannins that add grip to the succulent dark-berry flavor. The elegant 12.6% alcohol makes this wine extra food friendly.",US-Virginia-Cabernet Franc
"Production volume is up, but the concentration does not match the excellent 2014 edition of this reserve-level wine. There are modestly ripe melon and green apple flavors, along with a touch of buttered toast.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Popcorn, mustard, pickle brine and a heavy blast of oak create a barrel-driven bouquet. This is acidic and juicy on the palate, but also resiny. Flavors of briny citrus, nectarine and raw oak finish long and woody, with a cidery aftertaste.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
Light volatile aromas distract from this blend of Seven Hills (75%) and Les Collines vineyards. The fruit flavors seem a bit leaner than expected and also somewhat dried out.,US-Washington-Syrah
"Tarry, gritty, spicy plum aromas are common for Carmenère. This contains some Malbec, and the wine feels wide, grabby and a bit lush. Foxy, gamy, herbal berry and olive flavors finish spicy, with notes of oregano and basil.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"This was picked at the same time as the regular Viognier, but fermentation was stopped, leaving it as a sweet wine (about 4.8% r.s.). The fruit is laced with honey, lime and apricot; it's delicious without being cloying.",US-Washington-Viognier
"This is a dusty, earthy wine that has structure rather than fruit. It is tough in tannins that give a dry character to the wine. There is the potential for juiciness as the wine opens up, so wait before drinking. It will be best after 2017.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"The Barrel Select is given 26 months in 100% new oak, and it shows in both the nose and the mouth. Smoke and char are not accents here; they are the main event. The fruit flavors are simple cherry/berry, and thin out rather quickly in the finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Fruit dominates this bright, ripe wine. Cherries, red berries and a sprig of rosemary give freshness and fruitiness. The structure comes through with firm tannins that lie behind all this deliciousness.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
Jammy plum and currant flavors turn roasted in the glass. Typical notes of plum and berry support a steady palate.,Chile-Curicó Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, French oak, clove and a whiff of aromatic herb lift out of the glass. The structured palate offers black cherry, cinnamon, licorice, menthol and chopped mint alongside vibrant acidity and youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins that grip the finish. Give this time to fully develop and unwind. Drink 2020–2029.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"This crisp, lively red shows off the herbal notes of Provence—what the French call garrigue—and tart cherry fruit. It's less ripe than many Côtes du Rhône wines, but bright and mouthwatering. Drink now–2020.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"From the cooler Oak Knoll region of southern Napa, a wine with berry-cherry flavors and silky tannins. Yet it feels coarse and heavy, with a density and dullness Pinot Noir should not have. Suggests once again the unsuitability of Napa Valley for Pinot Noir.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Wood-aged wine, showing both spice and ripe tropical fruits. Mango and pineapple combine with vanilla and coconut milk to give a full, rich wine, though with Sauvignon Blanc's fresh acidity. Age for 2–3 years.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a good Cab for drinking with everyday fare, like burgers or tacos. It's softly tannic and sweet with blackberries, cherries and toasty oak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"With gentle tannins and juicy red fruits this is a ripe wine that is developing fast. It is beginning to get secondary flavors: mushrooms with undergrowth aromas. The fruit is still there, of course, giving red berry and acidity. Drink this wine soon, certainly from late 2017.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Alberto Longo is a rising star in the Puglia region and this fragrant Falanghina is a good example of his talent - especially considering that Puglia is primarily known for its reds. Aromas of exotic fruit, almond, Golden Delicious apple and pear are backed by thicker structure due to the region's sunny climate. Care has been taken to safeguard the variety's floral nuances and clean acidity.",Italy-Southern Italy-Falanghina
Emidio Pepe is an iconic leader of the organic and natural wine movement in Italy. This meaty Montepulciano d'Abruzzo shows some aromas of rubber and Band-Aid followed by polished cherry fruit. A soft and velvety mouthfeel is followed by cured meat and bresaola.,Italy-Central Italy-Montepulciano

"Dried-fruit flavors of prune and raisin lend a very ripe, dense richness to this high-powered full-bodied wine. It has good supportive acidity and tannins to balance out the extreme ripeness.",US-California-Red Blend
"In this generous interpretation of Nuits Saint-Georges, ripe berry fruits burst through the typical dry tannins. It has plenty of red-fruit flavors, a generous texture and structure. Drink this already attractive wine from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
Reserved aromas of kiwi and banana lead to dry lightly styled grapefruit flavors. The concentration doesn't seem all there.,US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine comes from a vineyard, created in 1894, in which the vines are planted against walls to get the maximum reflected heat. It is a majestic wine—a smooth wave, opulent and rich with intense acidity and just a hint of spice. The wine is just ready to drink, although it will be even more impressive from 2018.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"Kumeu River is one of New Zealand's most consistent producers of Chardonnay. This bottling boasts slightly austere aromas of wet stone, struck flint and woodsmoke, then delivers white peach and pineapple flavors on the palate. It's medium in body, with a slightly creamy texture and a moderately long finish.",New Zealand-Kumeu-Chardonnay
"Crushed stone notes lend complexity to blossom and honey aromas on this powerful yet delicately framed Riesling. The palate bursts with sweet, summery peaches, but quivers nervously with touches of lime and lemon acidity. It's delicious now for it's fruity exuberance, but those honeyed mineral tones should deepen deliciously from 2020 on.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"This is Langetwins's first vintage of Malbec from estate vineyards and it leaves a bit to be desired. Flat and a tad watery, it's a one-dimensional quaff.",US-California-Malbec
"For a fresh and fruity wine that tastes real and of the place, we recommend this Tempranillo-Cabernet blend. It is floral and just the slightest bit touched by oak. The palate is sweet, ripe and creamy, with strawberry and raspberry flavors holding on until the last drop. Good value from Campo de Borja, Spain.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon

"The intense herbaceous aroma is softened on the palate by the wine's lemon-curd flavor and smooth texture. Rich with intense fruitiness, this has notes of black currant and pink grapefruit, with bright acidity on the finish.",France-Southwest France-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This wine is herbal, prickly and roasted, singing the Salta tune of oddness and earthiness. It feels medium to full in the mouth, with a roasted dark-berry flavor and plenty of herb and pimiento tones. Finishes deep but salty, with notes of roasted red pepper and stew. A blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Argentina-Other-Red Blend
"This concentrated wine offers warm-climate aromas of stewed plum and scorched earth. The dense palate offers prune, baked black cherry, nutmeg and clove alongside velvety tannins. It's already accessible so drink soon to capture the remaining fruit flavors.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Very fine and high-toned, a Cabernet that shows real class and pedigree. Entirely drinkable now for its soft, lush tannins and elaborately detailed blackberry, black cherry, anise, carob and cedar flavors that last long through a spicy finish. Should age well through 2015.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This late-harvest Gewürztraminer boasts hints of dried apricot on the nose to go along with scents of pineapple and spice. It's a gingery-peppery spice note that persists through the palate and onto the finish, joined by ripe pear flavors. Because it's not that sweet or concentrated, this would be a good candidate to pair with foie gras or cheese rather than a true dessert.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"While there are wood aromas and wood flavors, the wine is equally about ripe fruit and generous tannins. It has spice, red-berry fruits and a rounded structure. It will age well, giving a rich wine from 2022.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This rich and full-bodied wine is a great candidate for aging. Stash it away in a cool place until at least 2018 when its slightly rough and drying tannins should begin to mellow and let all the ripe fruit and complex spice flavors come out. It's blended with a touch of Mourvèdre for a spicy, earthy accent.",US-California-Syrah
"This opens with aromas of blue and red flower, underbrush and mature, dark-skinned berry. The tense palate offers black cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise tobacco and mocha alongside firm, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. A note of chopped herb closes the finish. Drink 2018–2028.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Velvety and plush on the palate, this classic Cabernet offers firm, youthful tannins and full-bodied concentration of dense black fruit. Cedar, dried herb and tobacco scents frame its core, broadcasting a burning intensity and sanguine chewiness. Cellar and enjoy best 2023–2033.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Leather and cigar box rise to the fore of this smoky wine, accented in coconut, black pepper and cedar. Dusty on the palate, it hails from a Calistoga-based vineyard site, prime location for the variety. It becomes more intense in black pepper and brambly blackberry and plum as it finishes, lean enough to invite more sips.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Rustic, gritty berry aromas come with notes of plastic, oak grain and grass. This is raw, chewy and tannic in feel, with roasted, spicy berry flavors that run low on ripeness. A salt-and-pepper finish includes herbal berry flavors and sticky tannins.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This opens with earthy aromas of underbrush, game, scorched earth, sweat and ripe dark fruit. The chewy palate delivers juicy wild cherry, star anise and grilled herb framed in solid tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
Le Grillaie offers easy fruit tones of cherry and blackberry with touches of cola and licorice at the back. This simple red white would pair well with a heaping plate of pasta and meat sauce.,Italy-Central Italy-Sangiovese
"The lifted, pure scent of damask rose after rain hits you first. It is then joined by riper notions of Mirabelle but always with fresh, airy lift. While the palate weighs this down with perceptible sweetness, the aromas rise unfettered. This is a beautiful wine singing with rose and orange aromatics that persist with a lingering perfume.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Though this is their appellation blend, Mikey Giugni and Michael Brughelli don't hold back, offering elegant aromas of rose petals, purple flowers, rich pomegranate fruit, rusty strawberries and light vanilla on the nose. The palate begins with a light cranberry-raspberry flavor that deepens into tart mulberry before showing dried rose petals, uncrushed clove and a lava-rock minerality.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is rounded, rich, missing some acidity but with the compensation of ripe yellow fruits layered with pineapple and spice from wood. With all its sweetness, it is not for aging.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"From a dry-farmed vineyard planted more than 50 years ago, this 100% varietal wine is highlighted in compost, leather and graphite.

"Sweaty, raw, sour aromas are harsh. The palate is flat and chunky in feel, with pithy grapefruit, nettle and bitter green flavors. Pyrazines and bitterness ride roughshod on the finish.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Chardonnay
"Freshness characterizes the nose: green pear, ivy leaves and citrus notes play on nose and palate. This is light footed, easy drinking and charming. Drink soon while flavors are fresh.",Austria-Burgenland-Grüner Veltliner
"Animating, grassy, citrussy freshness sings on the nose. The palate bursts with fresh, juicy pear fruit. This is slender but full of drive and flavor. Perhaps the little angels depicted on the label helped to make this wine as light-footed and joyous as it is? It certainly will put a smile on the face of every lover of Grüner.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"This special edition has been made to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the familiar Graham's Six Grapes reserve Ruby. Selected from old vines in the Graham's vineyards, it is dense and impressively ripe. Concentrated fruit dominates, cut with acidity as well as a dark texture. Rounded and rich, it's made to drink now. The label with symbols of six grapes was taken from original ledger entries—the Graham code for the highest of six possible classifications for wine destined to be vintage Port.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Straightforward apple and lime flavors are simple and stony. Lemony acidity gives the palate snap and purpose, while flavors of kiwi, orange, lime and lemon finish tangy, with length and vitality. Drink now.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"This Dijon clone fruit, barrel fermented and aged on the lees, delivers a wine of exceptional concentration and intensity. Deeply fruity, with a lush mix of apple, pear and peach, it also brings flashy barrel flavors and impressive length. The persistent, tightly wound finish bodes well for further aging. Drink now through 2028.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"This simple, bright Dolcetto is packed tight with plump fruit tones, spice, leather and a touch of moist pipe tobacco. It's a thick, dense wine that offers loads of mature blackberry and cherry on the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto
"This sweet, luscious Riesling shows an incredible array of fruit character, ranging from pineapple to kumquat and superripe melon. So intensely fruity, it manages to hide whatever minerality might lie underneath, so if rocks are your thing, let this one age a good long time; otherwise, it's delicious now.",Germany-Pfalz-Riesling
"This is such an elegant wine that has all the structure of the vintage. Surrounding the tannins, the wine is sweet and ripe, with smokiness from the wood. It's powerful, elegant and sophisticated with a strong sense of poise. The tannins promise long-term aging.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Sweet oak tones come to the forefront of this bright Barbera d'Alba and add tones of vanilla, chocolate and cinnamon spice. There is enough fruit here, however, to balance out the wood tones and the wine is smooth and rich in the mouth.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"Quinta do Carmo, formerly owned by the Rothschild family of Château Lafite, is now part of the Bacalhâo group. Perfumed and fruity, this leaps from the glass with fresh, crisp lemon and pear flavors and light minerality. Drink now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese White
Here's a pleasantly fresh and fruit-forward Barbera d'Asti with notes of wild berry and blackberry backed by a delicate touch of vanilla spice and bitter chocolate. Aromas of smoked bacon fill in the rear and give the wine a long-lasting and penetrating finish.,Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"What a great red wine, just about perfect for steak. It's dry, full-bodied and tannic, with big, ripe blackberry and blueberry flavors. A little rustic, yes, but terrific for drinking now, and easily one of the best California Malbecs ever. And look at that price.",US-California-Malbec
"Winemaker Matt Dicey has crafted a winner, seamlessly combining aromas and flavors of toast, cherry, smoke and dried herbs into a relatively full-bodied, muscular wine. Although firm, it's approachable now, as the finish fades elegantly into dusty tannins laced with mocha and berries. Drink now–2020.",New Zealand-Central Otago-Pinot Noir
"This wine offers most things one wants in the variety, from an opening hit of cinnamon spice and toasted oak with an overlaying of juicy blackberry, licorice and mocha. Undoubtedly ripe and bold, it was aged in American oak for 20 months, only one-quarter of it new.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Structured, this offers earthy aromas of ripe berry, game, leather and anise. On the palate, notes of licorice, white pepper, clove and grilled herb add depth to the black cherry core. Firm tannins and nervy acidity provide an age-worthy framework. Drink 2020–2035.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This tangy wine has attractive acidity and a tightly coiled mineral texture. Apple and lemon flavors shoot right through the bright, crisp texture. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Grapes grown at high altitude give the cool feel to this crisp wine. A light touch of oak is revealed in the vanilla flavor that is finely integrated into the citrus and apple fruit. The wine is fruity, ready to drink young.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"Quelat is Ventisquero's highest-reaching SB, but it seems narrow and ultra tight, with match stick on the nose and not a ton of fruit. As it unwinds, more aromas and flavors come out; but always is it slightly vegetal. Alongside that dominant “green” character, look for pineapple and plenty of acidity.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This estate-grown wine honors the historical vineyard that brought the Napa Valley worldwide attention for Cabernet. It offers both complexity and elegance, as well as an herbal underbrush accented by tobacco. Chocolate, caramel and coffee add to the intrigue around smooth, velvety tannins.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Yakima Valley bottling highlights fresh herbs and sharp, juicy pear and apple fruit flavors. The vivid fruit is racy and tightly defined, and seems to gather strength and focus as it sits in the mouth. A splendid effort that really sets the standard for Washington Pinot Gris.",US-Washington-Pinot Gris
"A hearty blend of 76% Zinfandel and 24% Petite Sirah, this bottling packs a wallop of cinnamon-stick on the nose as well as strawberry puree, licorice and black pepper. Clove, allspice, and nutmeg arise immediately on the sip, backed by baked plum and bay leaf notes.",US-California-Red Blend
"This companion to the winery's “Right Blend” is two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, the rest an even mix of Merlot and Cab Franc. It's still a little stiff, lightly leathery, and shows a streak of green in the finish. But inside is some good Red Mountain material. A good decanting helps to open it up.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This two-acre site dates back to 1975; this is only the fourth time that Ponzi has offered it as a designate. Muscular and authoritative, it is still compact and somewhat unyielding. Dark cherry and cassis fruit is packed with iron filings, coffee grounds and black licorice. Winemaker Luisa Ponzi does her usual excellent job of putting the polish on outstanding fruit. Give it another decade and it will show its best.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"La Chablisienne owns the major part of the Grenouilles Grand Cru, centered on a winery called Château Grenouilles. This wine is powerful and still very young. It has weight and structure along with ripe, generous fruits that are typical of this vineyard. Touched by vanilla from wood aging, it is balancing out now. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"The bouquet of yellow rose, apricot, pear and cantaloupe is delightful. On the palate it's creamy and rich, and it should pair well with shrimp risotto.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Bianco
"This Cabernet Sauvignon also blends in Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, combining for a straightforward red wine experience offering blackberry and raspberry juiciness. Plenty of toasty character tinged by tobacco is provided by the oak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Doussot is a producer in the Aube region in southern Champagne, which explains the high alcohol for Champagne. However the wine still has all the crisp, mineral character of Champagne, broadened out with pineapple and ripe orange flavors. It's a youthful wine, showing tight acidity and that would soften and round in 3–4 more years.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Powerful wine. It has intense berries, a definite edge of black plum skins, spicy tannins and big black berry fruits. This is serious stuff, but the fruit is always there, a big burst of flavor followed by bright acidity.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"A good wine, grape-wise, with sharply etched, pure fruity flavors of citrus, fig and sweet tobacco. Acidity is fresh and juicy, and the wine is fully dry. Barrel fermented, it is super-oaky, maybe too much so, from the charry aromas to the woody flavors.",US-California-Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc
"Creamy, rich and loaded with apricot and peach, this would pair well with creamy vegetable risotto.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Chardonnay
"Solid as a boulder and concentrated on the bouquet, with a mix of floral, fine perfume and blackberry aromas. Feels lush, complete and easygoing, with blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Graceful and composed on the back end.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This is a supple, spicy wine, with a core of black cherry fruit. It's complemented with lighter flavors of cola, earth and coffee. At first it seems to fade a little too quickly, but with some breathing time the finish expands and brings in notes of cracker and toast.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Here's a reserve that really does merit its special designation. Made from 90-year-old vines that likely contain varieties other than Zinfandel, the wine is rich and complex. Delivers all the wild, brambly Zin quality you want, with tiers of blackberries, cherries, cassis, cherry liqueur, tobacco, vanilla and peppery spice flavors that go on and on in the finish. This is an exceptionally well-balanced Zin that's best in its flashy youth.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Fragrant in leather, lavender and licorice, this full-bodied Amador blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre and is fine, tannic and clearly born of mountain air. The finish tastes of very ripe fruit.",US-California-G-S-M
"Grilled beef, slathered in BBQ sauce, will soften and sweeten this hearty red from the Sierra Foothills. By itself, it's tannic and hard-edged. Shows rich flavors of black currants, cassis, raisins and dark chocolate.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"This opens with aromas of oak, espresso, mocha and plum. The firm palate offers oak extract, chocolate, licorice and black cherry alongside drying wood tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Red cherries and rose-petal extract waft into the plush nose on this bottling, which also discloses fresh acidity. The palate offers sour cherries, red bricks, chopped marjoram and cooked beef flavors.",US-California-Sangiovese
"Gritty and harsh, with tart acidity framing flavors of sour cherry candy and cola.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is the third year McCrea has made an Elerding Chardonnay, fermented on wild yeasts in stainless tanks, then aged sur lie in fairly neutral oak. Complex, textured and loaded with banana and butterscotch flavors, it's a rich wine that retains enough elegance to go down easily with food.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"The nose of this Gewürztraminer abounds in shades of blossom, ripe melon, berries and peach. By contrast, the palate is a bit earthier, showing more mineral tones than fruit. Full bodied and lavishly textured, it finishes with a touch of heat and tea-toned astringency.",US-New York-Gewürztraminer
Pellehaut likes blends and this wine has seven varieties. The result brings out more of the cool herbal character of Colombard and Sauvignon Blanc and less of the riper flavors of Chardonnay. That makes for a surprisingly attractive spice and asparagus flavored wine that has lines of acidity and tightly crisp citrus fruit flavors. Drink now.,France-Southwest France-White Blend
"This blend of 81% Cabernet Sauvignon is softened by 19% Merlot, providing a sanguine experience marred by ponderously huge tannins that make the fruit almost impenetrable. Once pierced, expect currant, cedar and leather.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Vibrant and easy-drinking, this delivers intense aromas and flavors of crushed strawberry, ground white pepper, clove and mineral backed up by a note of orange peel. Thanks to fresh acidity and smooth, supple tannins, it's made to be drunk young.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Frappato
"Mainly from Castelão with a little Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a ripe, full-bodied and complex wine. Tannins shoot through the solid black fruits, while acidity laces the texture. Flavors of chocolate, spice and final freshness promising short-term aging. Drink from 2015.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
"Aromas of diner-style hash brown potatoes figure into the mix here, a touch unsettling, as is the menthol and smoke.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Quite a delicious, rich and opulent wine. It shows Paso Robles softness and accessibility, with deep, long-lasting flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate, olives and cedar. Fully ready now.",US-California-Red Blend
"Saracina makes dazzling white wines, but this intense red is outstanding too. Dark fruits like blackberry mingle with bright raspberry in this hefty, substantial wine that's full bodied and handsomely tannic. It's dry, very textural in the mouth and concentrated well enough for a lingering finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Showing excellent varietal character, this light, textural, delicately spicy white wine is finished at just 12.8% alcohol, yet remains quite dry. There is a pleasing saltiness to the mouthfeel, almost like an Albariño, and the finish is crisp and nicely detailed.",US-Washington-Grüner Veltliner
"The interesting mix of aromas, ranging from fresh manure to cinnamon and cherries, gives way on the palate to the surprisingly unripe flavor of tart cranberries. The acidity is biting, making for a sinewy mouthful.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"There are beautiful fruit tones here that recall a fresh fruit salad with green apple, kiwi and thin slices of banana. You'll love the intensity and persistence of this wine and its long, sweet fruit flavors.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"The lifted, lemony scent promises purity and poise, while the palate delivers what nature provided: pure, crunchy fruit and the flavor of stone. This is dry and clean-cut in its traditional style, with potential to develop.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Beronia has blended modern and traditional touches to create a fine gran reserva with spice, vanilla, coconut, tobacco and dried berry aromas. The palate offers ripe tannins and kick, while the flavor profile is earthy, with mocha, coffee, chocolate and dried berry flavors. A long, lightly toasted and chocolaty finish provides a fitting end to an excellent wine. Best from 2015–2022.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Upfront aromas of cocoa, vanilla, sawdust and savory herb are followed by flavors of plum, cherry and barrel spice. The oak and fruit play equal roles, with the flavors a bit dialed back.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Carneros isn't ideal for Cabernet, as it's too cool. Even in this hot vintage, Truchard's '04 bottling has an unripe, vegetal streak beside the cassis, chocolate and new oak flavors.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This strange, floral-smelling Chard seems more like Gewürztraminer. It's creamy and cloying in the mouth, with spicy, sweet flavors of anise and lychee. It's particular and unique, but not very good.",Spain-Northern Spain-Chardonnay
"From the vineyard on the slope above Château Pavie, this is a beautiful, juicy and ripe wine. It has a mineral character with great swathes of black-currant fruit. This is a very fine wine, well delineated, ripe and with a delicious red-currant aftertaste. Drink from 2026.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Shy, timid notes of white peach and tropical fruit are offset by hints of vanilla and nutty biscuit. It feels medium to full bodied, but this lacks intensity and concentration overall. A touch of spice on the midpalate adds interest.",US-Virginia-Chardonnay
"Merlot leads the pack in this blend of six Bordeaux varieties with a dash of Syrah (5%). The fruit is taken from five different vineyards across Washington and Idaho. It has notes of candied cherry, licorice and ash, with tart flavors and dry, astringent tannins.",US-America-Red Blend
"At 98 years of age, the vineyard certainly qualifies as old vine, which isn't the case with all wines so labeled. Who really knows what varieties actually constitute these ancient vineyards, but this wine is certainly rich in Zinfandel character. The wild raspberry and cherry fruits have a briary edge, suggesting the tartness of Dr. Pepper cola, the nettles of summer chamomile and the savoriness of green peppercorn. There's little question that the wine will age well, but there's no reason not to drink it now, with proper decanting.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This has delicate aromas of chopped herb and red berry. The no-frills diluted palate offers suggestions of unripe cherry, orange peel and a touch of mint alongside brisk acidity and grainy, fleeting tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Here's a caramel and red fruit-flavored wine that is soft and round. It is light and bright, with a light prickle on the tongue as well as a tangy, orange peel texture. Screwcap.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Rosé
"A savory rather than fruity blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache, this bottling offers black pepper, anise and light violet alongside boysenberry and elderberry fruit on the nose. The palate tightens up into underripe cherry, thyme, marjoram and bay leaf, with very dry elderberry fruit tones.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Fresh pear and lemon aromas are brightened with hints of white florals on this brisk, medium-bodied wine. Off dry in style, it's juicy on the palate with concentrated white peach flavors accented with honey and tea notes. It's an elegant yet easy quaffer at a very reasonable price.",US-New York-Riesling
"Basic apple and vanilla bean aromas carry the nose to a plump, round palate with tropical flavors and banana. Feels peachy and tastes yeasty and sweet on the finish. Highly regular as a whole.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"At first glance it may seem a little saucy, but as it gains its legs this aged Yecla wine shows solid plum, berry and cassis aromas and flavors along with a lively, healthy palate. It's incredibly smooth in the mouth, and definitely ready to go. Spice and chocolate are the finishing touches to what amounts to a nice, warm-climate Mourvèdre. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, Imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"Compared to Montecastro's higher-end 2009s, this smells stalky and leathery, with herbal shadings accenting familiar black-fruit aromas. The palate feels grabby, while the flavors suggest charred leather, stalky berry and clove. The lasting impression is of a gamy, slightly hot wine that's good but has its weaknesses.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
Earth and spice make for a nice entry and flavor profile into this wine. However it becomes thin and somewhat diluted on the palate.,US-California-Pinot Noir
"Crisp cherry and plum aromas are gritty. This Malbec shows wiry acidity but the palate is still a touch soupy. Salty plum and oak spice flavors include notes of clove and pepper. As a whole, this is oaky and fairly heavy.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
This California-made Oregon Pinot captures a sense of the particular terroir of Chehalem Mountains fruit. Wild strawberries are laced with peppery spice and a streak of cola. Good penetration and texture.,US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"From vines planted in 1976, this aromatic wine shows the depth that old vines can bring. Strawberry, cola, butter (from 14 months in 50% new French oak), wild cherry and more come into focus, and although delicate, they last and last on the palate. The finish is spectacular.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A very light and flowery nose starts the package rolling, followed by light candied raspberry on the palate. Features a smooth texture throughout, with the slightest notes of cherry cough drops and fruit punch. A simple, straightforward wine that goes down easy.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This had quite an evolved nose, suggesting bitter almond and vanilla, as much as pear and dried orange rind. The palate is dry and expressive, fluid but precisely drawn showing great depth of flavor and concentration. An intriguing nuttiness makes for a long dry finish.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"Take a hot year like 2009 and combine it with a hot region like Toro and what you get is this rich, ribald wine. Heavy aromas of raisin and blackberry suggest maximum ripeness. A beefy, saturated palate houses dark flavors of prune, chocolate and baked plum, while the finish is dark, toasty, chewy and a pure reflection of the Toro region. Drink through 2018.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro
"Ripe and fruity, this is a finely balanced, already delicious wine. The tannins promise some aging potential, bringing a dry core to the rich blackberry fruit. It's firm, yet layered with fine juiciness. A forward wine that will still develop well.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"91-93. Barrel sample. A smooth, rounded wine, this shows opulence with its rich blackberry fruit.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This much-admired vineyard brings exotic scents of ripe black-cherry fruit soaked in Asian spices. The wine is compact and powerful, with strong tannins and a light whiff of tar. Drink 2018 through 2026.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This is wonderfully complex and aromatic, with scents ranging from baking spices and savory beef to mixed berries. That swirl of seeming contradictions continues on the palate, backed by luxurious, supple tannins that linger softly on the finish. Drink now–2025.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Roasted and leathery smelling, with aromas of brick dust, root beer and exotic spices. Feels grabby and astringent, with boistrous tannins. It tastes toasty and black, with baked berry flavors and tons of chocolate and spice. It feels a bit choppy on the finish, with an espresso-like aftertaste.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"A soft wood- and almond-flavored wine. It misses fresh fruit, instead offering a rounded, ripe character that suggests it is not for aging.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"While there is no wood aging in this wine there is some good concentration and richness making it full-bodied, with ripe citrus and minerality. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese White
"Charred and burnt-smelling, and those aromas are overpowering although not necessarily bad. Feels big and tannic, with bite to go with dark flavors of bitter coffee, roasted black plum and wild berry. The charred, burnt character that controls the bouquet returns with a fury on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Named after the rare Douro golden oriole bird (which obviously likes to eat figs), this is a bright, fruity wine with light tannins that give it a delicious fresh, red fruit character. It has a smoky edge from wood aging, finely balanced and ready to drink now.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Here's an enticing Vino Nobile offering aromas of underbrush, tobacco leaf, ripe cherry and spice. The palate delivers succulent black cherry, plum, cinnamon and nutmeg along with velvety tannins. Although it shows the warmth of the vintage, it still retains elegance and class. Delicatio Wines, Golden Vines.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Marc Beyer has succeeded well, with a crisp, mineral style of wine that can marry well with so many fish and seafood dishes.",France-Alsace-Riesling

"Fruity wine, light, elegant with a touch of minerality, it shows a fine balance of green fruits and its spice. The wine is all about freshness, crispness, a touch of minerality to give texture. At the end, the fragrant acidity shines. Screwcap.",Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
"This affordably priced bottling is quite solid for the cost, showing deep black cherry, blueberry, cedar shavings, tobacco leaf and ash, cocoa and slight bay leaf on the nose. Chalky tannins show first on the sip, and then unwind to offer blackberry fruit, woody pencil shavings and a decent density.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Concentrated, intense aromas of graphite, blackberry, spice and earth notes set up a rich palate that's registering at max ripeness. Gigantic blackberry, baked black plum and toasted flavors finish dark and lush. This blend of Cabernet, Petit Verdot and Syrah is a big-wine lover's dream come true. Drink through 2023.",Spain-Central Spain-Red Blend
"Slightly dusty, herbal notes distract from pleasant peach and strawberry flavors in this dry rosé made from Pinot Noir along with a splash of Chardonnay. It's delicate in concentration but refreshing on the palate.",US-New York-Rosé
"Beautiful focus and bright complexity characterize this northern Italian blend of Riesling, Pinot Bianco and Sauvignon. Soft layers of stone fruit, citrus and melon give the wine momentum. Enosi would pair with creamy risotto di scampi.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend
"An unusually dark color, even for this notoriously black varietal, makes this powerful wine stand out from the first glance. Full bodied, it piles on the flavor and layers of tannic texture in a bold but pleasing way. Rich, concentrated blackberry, dark chocolate, wood smoke and baking-spice notes fill the mouth and linger on the long finish. It will be best after 2020.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"This is a taut, dense and minerally wine that's packed with as much tannin as black currant fruit. The structure and layers of acidity demand long-term aging.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
Light aromas of herbs and citrus lead to fleshy fruit flavors with a lightly spritzy feel. Pair it with baked chicken.,US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"Another outstanding value from Three Rivers, this powerfully-built wine mixes ripe berry and plum fruit with polished, astringent tannins. It opens well, but really hits its stride on the back palate, with the balance and concentration to age. That said, it's drinking awfully well right now.",US-Washington-Merlot
"This young Chianti Classico is still a bit closed, but it reveals cherry and raspberry sensations along with black- and white-pepper notes. It's still tightly knit but it should should open up well after one or two more years bottle aging.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Light red in color and quite cloudy in the glass, this appellation blend boasts sweet-and-sour spice on the nose, along with kalamata olive, sagebrush, tangy fig and raspberry jam aromas. Its underripe red fruit and piquant olive character on the palate will please those who enjoy the style but turn off those who don't.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"This is dark in color and compact on the nose, with can't-miss aromas of herbal berry, mint, rootiness and chocolate. The palate feels good and fresh, with oak-based flavors of berry fruits that smack down with firm tannins in front of an oaky, medium-long finish.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Pickled and nutty on the nose, the palate brings little nuance in briny, savory flavors of cidery apples.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend

"The first such bottling from the producer's 75-acre ranch on Westside Road, this impressive white is crisp in acidity with a fullness of body, both lengthy and complex.

"Very rich in blackberries and cassis, with an herbal grounding of sage and tobacco and a dusting of freshly crushed black pepper. You'll find hard-edged tannins and some sharpness to the mouthfeel.

"Named after the Lyre style of vine training, this wine comes from the far north of Burgundy, close to Chablis. It is soft, smooth and creamy, with a light minerality and perfumed acidity. It is just right to drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Very tannic and concentrated, this is a dry wine with a chunky structure and a dark, firm feel. Plum skin and black currant notes are behind the scenes; this wine needs at least three more years of aging.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This blend of Sangiovese and Canaiolo offers a nose of berry fruit and light almond shadings backed by an easy, informal mouthfeel. Pair this fruit-driven red with pasta or pizza.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Fragrant and polished, this radiant wine offers enticing scents of elderflower, yellow peach and aromatic herb. The elegantly structured palate delivers apricot, nectarine zest and a hint of white pepper, all framed in vibrant acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Kerner
"This wine is a near equal split between three varieties: Gerenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre. Mesmerizing aromas of red cherry, plum, wood spice and herb are followed by quite tart elegant fruit flavors. It shows a lot of finesse but still needs some time to stretch its legs.",US-Washington-G-S-M
"Fruity and earthy, with sly, narrow flavors of blackberry and chocolate. This has the ripeness and power that one would expect from a high-end Malbec, but also a bit more finesse and natural “redness” than many heavyweights from Argentina. Hints of herbs, pine, lemon peel and mocha grace the structured finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Spicy plum and berry aromas are slightly earthy and on the money. This feels full and plump, but well balanced. Spicy dry plum and berry flavors are limited but focused, while this offers a vanilla note on a finish that fades out slow and easy. Drink through 2019.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Aromas of wood shop, espresso and licorice lead the nose. The firm palate delivers oak extract, licorice, clove, dried black cherry and sage alongside tightly-knit, drying tannins. It has structure but not much fruit richness remains.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A whiff of crumbled clay lends an earthen tone to this vibrant lime-edged spätlese. Crisp green plum and grapefruit flavors are juicy and fresh, sweetened by a kiss of honey. It's gossamer light in texture yet lingers with a lacy haze of sweet citrus.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Aromas of citrus, white stone fruit and a vegetal hint suggesting tomato leaf lead the way. The racy palate offers grapefruit, pineapple, fresh white peach and flinty mineral while a pleasantly bitter note closes the finish.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Carricante

"This stellar blend of 66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot is woven together with care, revealing an earthy bouquet of leather and compost. Old World in style, with its light approach and elegant underpinnings, it offers layers of clove, black pepper and graphite flavors within a balanced frame.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This cuvée gets some extra time in 40% new wood, and is bottled unfiltered. Plush blackberry and black cherry fruit flavors, accented with streaks of cola and chocolate, capture your attention. It's a rich tasty forward immediately enjoyable bottle, so go for it now through 2020.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Smells a little jumbled out of the chute, but in no time it rounds into form. The nose turns out to be rich, jammy and convincing, while the palate is robust and features ripe plum and berry flavors. For bold fruit, vigor and drive, this answers the call. It could probably stand to be more elegant and nuanced, but as is it's a fine mix of Carmenère, Cabernet and Syrah.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Red Blend
"Building on 150 years and six generations of winemaking tradition, the winery trends toward a leaner style, with the classic California buttercream aroma cut by tart green apple. In this good everyday sipping wine, flavors that range from pear to barely ripe pineapple prove approachable but not distinctive.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A great price for a wine this rich and spicy. It's busting with ripe tropical fruit, peach, tangerine and pear notes, and spices, too. And it's dry, with just a hint of residual sugar to make the fruit round and forward. Turns really pretty on the polished, spicy finish.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"Fresh and fragrant, this offers aromas of rose and violet with a whiff of woodland berry. The elegant palate delivers bright red cherry, crushed strawberry, clove and peppercorn alongside polished tannins and fresh acidity. Drink through 2020.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"Earthy aromas of underbrush, used leather, violet and game lead the nose while the straightforward palate offers juicy red cherry, clove and a saline note. Supple tannins and fresh acidity give it an approachable framework. Drink 2018–2024.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A sweet style of sparkling wine, with brisk acidity framing orange, lime, vanilla and honey flavors. Nice with wedding cake, at a good price.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"A wine that continues the impressive rise of du Tertre. It is becoming one of the sure values of Margaux, and this 2009 is both ripe and finely balanced. The acidity boosts the rich fruits, sweet tannins and the warm finish.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Fiery and borderline herbaceous aromas are green-leaning, which is surprising considering that 2011 was a warm, dry, highly regarded vintage in Rioja. On the palate, this feels strained, with outsized acidity. Herbal, roasted wild-berry flavors come with a lot of oak and clove, while the finish is fairly tart and herbal.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Beyond a hint of stuck flint on the nose, this offers clean, varietally correct aromas and flavors of white nectarine, grapefruit and gooseberry. It's nicely balanced in the middle of the spectrum, offering a harmonious mix of stone fruit and citrus.",Australia-South Australia-Sauvignon Blanc
"A little sharp and unfocused on the nose, but the palate is simple and juicy, with tangy red-fruit flavors backed by good acidity and solid tannins. Overall it's healthy and ready but sorely missing that one key ingredient: finesse.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This leads with subtle black plum and cooking spice scents. The simple palate shows clove, tobacco and blackberry flavors. Drink soon.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"This simple Merlot has candied flavors of cherries and red licorice, sprinkled with savory spices. The tannins are soft, and an herbal note leads to a fruity finish. Drink up.",US-California-Merlot

"A lovely Cab, polished and refined, and a huge improvement over the winery's 2004 bottling. Shows classic Napa Valley softness and roundness, a wine that seduces the palate. There are complex flavors of black currants, sweet sage and cedar, wrapped into silky, ripe tannins. Delicious now, and should develop for a decade or more.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Stakes out the dry, acidic, minerally side of Pinot Grigio's personality, with citrus fruit and spice flavors and a mouthwatering quality that's exactly what you want in inexpensive bottlings of this variety. Lovely as a cocktail sipper, or with appetizers ranging from puff pastries to bruschetta.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"Something floral and soft hovers above the fruit. There also is the rich hazel presence of fine oak. The fruit is beautifully luminous: very aromatic red cherry is drenched in the soft vanilla of oak. The tannins are silky but dense. White pepper shimmers everywhere, supported by the inherent freshness of the palate. This still needs time. Drink 2020–2030.",Austria-Thermenregion-St. Laurent
"Kudos to Santa Rita for harnessing the inherent qualities of the '07 vintage and applying them to this very nice Carmenère. The wine is bold and loud, but controlled and balanced. It starts with rowdy black fruit and folds in cassis, pepper, bitter chocolate and some smoked meat and olive. Drink now and over the next year or two.",Chile-Rapel Valley-Carmenère

"Stunningly good, this offers off-dry numbers (13g/L) but plenty of high acid tang. Honeysuckle, tart citrus, green apple and honeycomb start it out, and the wine kicks into more and more gears with superb concentration and depth. Lemon verbena and lemon-tea flavors come into the extended finish, with light tannins and superb details. Drink now through 2035.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Heady aromas of citrus and orchard fruit almost jump out of the glass. The savory, medium-bodied palate tastes of ripe pear, mature apple and creamy peach interspersed with energizing mineral notes. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors.",Italy-Southern Italy-Greco
"A crush of mineral notes on the nose lend earthy dimension to this buoyantly ripe, fruity auslese. Layers of sweet mango, pineapple and guava abound on the palate, off set by a spine tingling spray of lime. It's decadent yet balanced, with a long, irresistibly clingy finish. Ready to drink now but it will shine for decades to come.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"This high-octane wine smells like Port, honey and black figs. It tastes very ripe, almost hot, feels quite tannic and heavy, and has a touch of sweetness to redeem it. Enjoy this as an after-dinner drink with chocolate or a cigar.",US-California-Red Blend
"So ripe and lush with fruit, this could only be from California. It assaults the palate with blackberries, cherries and mocha, but with an interesting, earthy green olive note. Oak adds predictable but rich notes of buttered toast. The tannins are soft enough for you to drink this lovely wine now, but you can age it for 6–8 years if you want.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe melon and grapefruit flavors are plush and pristine in this forward off-dry Riesling. Zesty tangerine acidity brightens the midpalate and leads a moderately long, sugar-cookie finish. It's a refreshing, fruity quaffer intended for youthful consumption.",Germany-Pfalz-Riesling
"This intensely golden-colored wine offers aromas of mature apricot, dried fig and clove that carry over to the palate along with candied nectarine zest. It also shows the warmth of alcohol despite the rather modest 13.5% avb.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Moscato
"Grapy aromas seem simple at first, but with time tarry black plum and citrus peel notes emerge. This is very tannic, arguably a bit too much so. Plum, blackberry and chocolate flavors end with a reverb of hard tannins. For best results, give this as much air as possible.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"On first take, this smells murky and baked, but with airing it freshens up. In the mouth, this features hard acidity while the flavor profile leans towards prune, earthy plum and toasty oak. There's heat and roughness to the finish along with woodsy, spicy berry flavors. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Blended with 16% Cabernet Sauvignon and aged in a mixture of French and American oak (50% new), this wine highlights notes of raspberries and cream speckled with oak spices and an herbal edge. The palate is light and elegant in style while still retaining a sense of depth, plushness and balance.",US-Oregon-Merlot

"Less bright and perfumed than La Coterie's Passe Colline bottling, this is still a soft, approachable wine with ample cherry fruit. Hints of leather and white pepper give it a bit of complexity. The blend is 65% Grenache, 25% Syrah and 10% Carignan.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"A strong nose of mint and eucalyptus with just a hint of cherry belies a fruit-driven palate dominated by cherry, cranberry sauce and strawberry. Plush tannins coat the mouth, with cooling herbs re-emerging on the finish.",Bulgaria-Thracian Valley-Red Blend
"Aromas of latex, iodine and stewed berry fruits are challenging. This Cab Franc feels jumbled, chunky and a bit out of shape. Herbal, woody notes ride heavily on top of saucy, lightly green berry flavors. It finishes with green-leaning mint, basil and fennel notes.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Franc
"A mix of strawberry-rhubarb compote, mocha-chocolate and chalky tannins are featured in this 80% Cabernet with smaller amounts of other Bordeaux varieties blended in. Dense and meaty, a powerful jolt of cassis rears its head on the finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This wine's elevated alcohol level (16.2%) gives it plenty of fullness on the palate, and combined with jammy fruit and superripe tannins makes for a slightly sweet palate impression and a creamy texture. It does offer waves of raspberry and blueberry fruit topped by hints of cinnamon and vanilla as well as savory undercurrents of grilled meat and tapenade. Drink now and over the next few years for its exuberant fruit.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz

"This wine is a blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, a whopping 23% Petit Verdot, 7% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc. The aromas leap up from the glass, with notes of garden herb, tar, black cherry and licorice. The flavors are rich and saturated, loaded with black-fruit notes that persist effortlessly on the finish. It shows a fine sense of structure and balance along with a compelling texture. Best after 2024.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A simple, sweet quaff that's surprisingly good, from a winery known more for their wines from French-American hybrids. The peach and superripe apple flavors show a clean, crystalline quality to the fruit.",US-New York-Riesling
"Biodynamically run, Château Tour des Gendres is at the top of the tree in Bergerac. This beautifully fruity wine shows freshness as well as depth of tannins, complex berry and bitter chocolate flavors. It is firm, but as a sign of the vintage, has a light character with final freshness.",France-Southwest France-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Bolder and bigger than most, this wine combines generous fruit flavors with great acidity and structured tannins for a lip-smacking texture. The red cherry and raspberry aromas are intriguing, while the flavors deliver the goods and the finish is firm.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is powerful, ripe and creamily smooth, bearing yellow fruits that dominate the wood aging. It's a rich medley of apricot and yellow peach flavors, laced with citrusy acidity. Full, complex and generous, this is worth aging for over four years.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"The nose of this translucent red is very shy. The palate is exquisitely light with an aromatic touch of conifer on fresh tart red currants. The palate is very dry and light. Try chilling this as you would a rosé. While there is not a lot of body, there is lots of charm. Drink soon.",France-Alsace-Pinot Noir
"This is a classically styled Coonawarra Cab, with ample cassis, cedar and mint wrapped up into a balanced, well-proportioned whole. The Katnook style favors silky tannins over power, making this elegant Cabernet one to drink over the next several years.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The wine is smoky, with black currant-fruits and a core of dry tannins. Those tannins are probably not going anywhere much, so while the fruit and acidity will soften, the wine will always be dry.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This blend of Syrah and Grenache is hard and tough, with stringy, dry tannins and flavors of vegetables and cherry cough syrup. Lots of new French oak does little to make it more palatable.",US-California-Red Blend

"Savory smoked-nut notes juxtapose ripe red cherry and strawberry in this full-bodied rosé. While quite substantial in mouthfeel, it has bright citrus acidity that lends some refreshment on the finish.",US-New York-Rosé

"Benuara—a blend of Nero d'Avola (70%) and Syrah (30%)—is characterized by distinct aromas of soy sauce, root beer and Chinese spice. The wine offers soft, smooth texture and polished tannins, but its Asian profile suggests a pairing with hearty Indian or Thai curries.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"A beautiful Pinot Noir, lilting, refined and utterly delicious.

"If a buttery, oaky, roasty, toasty Viognier is what you seek, Virginia's Tarara Vineyards has it.

The flavors veer toward green apples, Asian pears, Meyer lemons, limes and other juicy, acid-inspired fruits.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Dark purple in color, and very rich on the nose. There's also balancing tart aromatics of rhubarb and bramble. Looks, smells and tastes like a New World/California style of Pinot Noir. It's creamy and oaky in the mouth, but behind that there's ripe, varietal flavors that grow on you as the wine airs out. Maybe too big and brawny for fans of elegant PNs, but plenty good if you like a full-bodied modern wine.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir
"Sourced from the crest of Catherine's block of Dineen Vineyard, this brooding wine brings aromas of dried and fresh herbs, vanilla, orange peel and pencil lead, which need some time to unwind. The cranberry and cherry flavors bring a sense of freshness, with the tannins providing some heft. It needs time to be fully appreciated.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Notshowing much generosity now, pinched by tough tannins that give it a scoury astringency. Deep inside is a molten core of cherries and cola, with complex earth, mushroom and mineral notes. Pretty soft, but dry and focused, and could age well. Try after 2014.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Fresh and fruity with a strong lemon flavor, this is full, crisp and totally bone-dry. It does have some weight and a lemon zest sharpness as well as a ripe texture from aging on the lees. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Melon

"Still a baby, and easy to misunderstand, but this is one serious puppy.  Youthful tannins and acids frame juvenile, primary fruit flavors of blackberries, and oak has been tastefully applied. But the rich core of fruit, and overall balance, urge longterm aging for a good ten years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Direct and appealing with notes of dried herbs, cherry, and toast. It's broad in feel with good depth and structure with dry tannins the only thing holding it back.",US-Washington-Merlot

"This is a big but balanced expression of Cabernet that is ready to drink now. Layers of black cherry, caramel, vanilla, smoke and crushed black rocks show on the lavish nose.

"A fine trio of vineyards—Boushey, Cold Creek and Sagemoor—comprise the blend here. The fruit runs the table from cherry to blackberry to cassis, threaded throughout with fresh herbs and clean earth. Good balance with no heat from the 14.7% alcohol; the tannins are polished and drying, and the finish has a soft, leathery smoothness.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Gritty leathery plum aromas are intense but also low on ripeness and charm. Par for 2013, which was quite cool and rainy, this wine feels racy, with abrasive tannins. Short standard black plum and berry flavors finish with controlled toasty oak notes.",Spain-Northern Spain-Mencía
"Quite full bodied and obviously powerful in flavor, this wine is piled deep and rich with fruit aromas and flavors like ripe blackberries and blueberries plus chocolate and espresso. An impressive, astringent texture adds structure and makes it appetizing to drink, while the tannins seem to help the opulent flavors linger during the aftertaste.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A dark, smoky wine generous in both tannins and ripe, concentrated fruit. Small percentages of Petite Sirah and Merlot were blended in, the Petite Sirah perhaps for color and structure; the Merlot to soften things down a touch.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Riesling is all about good acidity and a clean,  racy mouthfeel. Flavors are fresh but don't speak volumes—think pear skin, plus some grass. Offers nice banana, pear and dust aromas on the nose.",Australia-Western Australia-Riesling

"Stony, minerally aromas show a pinch of toast on top of white peach and apple cider scents. On the palate, this stays on the straight and narrow, with high acidity. Clementine and tangerine flavors finish as stony as the name implies; drink this shellfish-friendly, unique Argentinean Chardonnay through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"Jammy berry and cassis aromas come with a bit of leather and horse hide. This brings it on the palate, but there isn't much finesse to the mix of blackberry and baked plum flavors along with hard tannins. Give this time in the glass and it opens up and mellows out.",Argentina-Other-Malbec

Just fantastic to experience now, and it should easily develop over at least a decade.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lovely whiffs of fresh rose petals come up from the glass, along with apple blossoms and intimations of pale cherry fruit. The wine has some good grip to the tannins, and a hint of clay and earth. More time is needed to knit the different strata firmly together.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"Dense and dark in color, this wine has a black currant flavor. The tannins are ripe and soft, and the texture has a fresh lilt to it from the acidity and fruitiness. Only on the finish do the youthful tannins show, promising medium-term aging.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Coming from the cool 2011 vintage, the aromas of herbs, apple and spice are light. It's medium bodied and creamy in feel with a lemony finish.",US-Washington-Chardonnay

"This floral wine opens as if in a damp but not wet forest, surrounded by ripe, red cherry trees. Likable from the start, it's grippy on the palate, expressively juicy, seductive and refined. Blackberry and dried herb pop on the finish, providing a darker side to the red fruit.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"A bit hard in tannins and stinging in acidity, but the lush, ripe flavors make up for it. Offers waves of black and red cherries, cola, licorice and bacon flavors, accented with sweet, smoky oak. Good now, and should develop for a few years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This bottling from a winery that uses both the highest of technology and most old school of techniques is incredibly subtle at first, but then come waves of mace, mulberry, forest floor and dried shiitake aromas. The palate starts with sharper herbs and spice, from thyme to nutmeg and allspice, and then the purple flower flavors explode like a bouquet in the mouth. Elderflower touches fly into the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"The fruit for this provocatively named bottling is sourced from the lower Waihopai, or “Spy Valley” section of Marlborough.

"At 70% Tempranillo and only 25% Cabernet and Merlot, there's a detectable green core running through the nose and palate. Surrounding that is sizable fruit and oak, the latter of which adds dill to the fray. All in all there's enough body and soul to save the wine, but along the way it's got some issues.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Intensely charred and rubbery, with peanutty aromas that also fold in fresh-laid road tar. Gotta say this is unusual for Maipo and Chilean Cabernet; it's herbal, with a green infiltration.

"Like the name suggests, this Carmenère is opaque purple in color, with earthy, complex aromas of graphite, char and herbal black currant. The palate is, not surprisingly, saturated and dense.

"Sweet, jammy aromas of blueberry and cassis suggest ripeness to the max. For confirmation, the palate is rich, plump, soft and a bit heavy, with prune, baked berry and cassis flavors that end in a chewy, warm, fully ripe finish. Drink this beefy, ripe Malbec now through 2015.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"High in acidity with a voluptuously sleek and supple body, this is a smoothly tamed wine. It's youthful and structured, with a mix of citrus, black cherry and cola. Medium bodied, it's memorably balanced and possesses subtle power.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Always one of Catalonia's more elevated cavas, this version opens with spiced dried apple aromas and a bit of yeast and dough. The palate is both sweet and tangy, with tangerine as the lead fruit. And the finish is consistent and moderately deep. A handsome wine with character. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"The parcel called La Mission in the heart of the Mercurey vineyards is wholly owned by the Devillard family, so they call it a monopoly. It is a wine that effortlessly balances tangerine and lemon flavors with ripe spiced peaches and a tight mineral texture. The wine is still young, still developing, so wait until 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Gritty, tarry aromas of black fruits carry a certain sharpness. The mouthfeel is clampy and narrow, with raw acidity. Flavorwise, this is acid-driven, thus expect racy red-fruit notes with a stalky, burnt offset. The finish is peppery and lean.",Chile-Curicó Valley-Carmenère
"The 2005 Pinot Noir from Honeywood is a dead ringer for—guess what!—the 2004 Pinot Noir from the same winery. Soft entry, herbal and somewhat stemmy mid-palate, tannic, slightly hot finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This ripe and creamy wine offers a good depth of flavor. It has plenty of fresh apple flavors, although the dominant fruits are riper, richer and tangy with orange zest and apricots. To balance all this fruit, the texture is tight with a good streak of minerality to give a crisp aftertaste.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"A recommended Chardonnay that's a step or two up from this country's norm. Vanilla, toast and apple aromas set the stage for lively apple, peach and melon flavors. Honey and toast work the finish, and overall it blends tropical power and sweetness with subtleties and some elegance.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"For many consumers, Guigal remains a reference point for Rhône wines. This Saint-Joseph is a fine example, showcasing black-cherry fruit, earth and leather notes. It's firmly structured, with crisp acids as well, and should drink well for up to a decade or more.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This plump, dry-style Pinot Gris features plenty of fruit, which ranges from apple to pear and through to pineapple. The finish comes with a cool, refreshing note and ample length.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Gris
Cedar and coconut aromas rest comfortably atop ripe black fruit scents. In the mouth this is juicy pure and well structured. Big chocolaty flavors of mixed black fruits show strong notes of charred wood and grilled meat on a toasty chocolaty finish. Drink through 2022.,Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Fleshy, plump aromas of baked apple, melon and barrel smoke set up a honeyed, flat palate. This Viura is melony and mealy tasting, with notes of mushroom, papaya and bitterness on the finish. Overall this is short on flavor and feels creamy and heavy.",Spain-Northern Spain-Viura
"From an estate vineyard, this wine combines 60% Cabernet Sauvignon with 20% Malbec and 20% Petit Verdot. Brick tar, blackberry and smoked meat show first, followed by leather and black pepper. Medium acidity and body weight make way for firm, integrated tannin. If you allow the wine to open over a couple of hours in the glass, it'll share further flavors of chocolate and vanilla.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Acidity and mushroom and earth notes combine to mute the fresh fruits in this Chardonnay. It's rich in apricots, oranges and peaches, enhanced by oak, but has a dry, austere tug that suggests brief cellaring. Drink after 2016.",US-California-Chardonnay
"You can taste the oak and lees influence in this rich, full-bodied Chardonnay. With a creamy mouthfeel, it gets serious on the midpalate, with flavors of buttery peach, orange and nectarine fruit. Outstanding and elegant.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Leathery, scratchy black-fruit aromas are striated and minty, with a note of oak. This Monastrell feels grabby, hefty and on the bold and bulky side. Jammy blackberry flavors come with minty green notes, while this tastes mildly grassy and feels a bit hot on the finish.",Spain-Levante-Monastrell
"A unique blend of Pinot Gris, Muscat, Riesling and Gewürztraminer, it is—as its name suggests—quite floral, along with notes of lychee and white grapefruit. It drinks off dry, with a medium-bodied feel. Citrus and spice flavors carry through the finish.",US-Washington-White Blend
"Firm and focused, this lightly spiced effort supports its tart cherry fruit with ample acidity. Hints of toasted coconut build in the finish. A few more years of bottle age should bring further integration.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"This blend showcases Grenache and Mourvèdre, with small amounts of Syrah, Counoise and Carignan. Raspberry, cherry and chocolate flavors combine with and are enlivened by a dash of white pepper.

"Vibrant black-fruit aromas come across young and vital, with a lot of oak topping. The palate is chunky, with pulpy weight and plenty of body. Blackberry and black currant are the lead flavors, and they are backed by chocolaty oak. This feels meaty and bulky, with tons of fruit-forward heft and power.",Spain-Central Spain-Tempranillo
"With the goal of adding subtle aromatics and structure, this wine was given eight months in 50% new French oak puncheons, with the other 50% in neutral. The wine intrigues as much as refreshes, with crisp acidity and bright sparks of citrus prominent. Medium bodied, it has a complexity of baked apple and pear lurking in the background.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Taurasi can sometimes be a gritty, raw wine with overdone power and heft. But this expression is soft and yielding thanks to its aromas of blackberry, vanilla, black stone and spice. The tannins are rock-solid and hard. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"Foamy, fresh and rather soft, this mouthfilling wine smells subtly like raspberries and cherries. It tastes attractively fruity and has a smooth texture.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Deep, dark and instantly compelling, this powerful wine features black cherry and cassis fruit adorned with clove, citrus, cardamom, nougat and mocha. The chewy tannins and overall tightness suggest that further cellaring will continue to improve it. Drink 2016 through 2030.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Doesn't say so on the label, but this is largely Syrah, with 8% Grenache. It's a well-structured, balanced wine whose high alcohol wears itself well around the blackberries and currants. But it does lack the concentration and drama of previous bottlings, evidence of the difficult 2011 vintage. Ready to drink now.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Young, tart and tight, this displays primary fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, with sharp, lemony acids. Bottle aging through 2017 may help smooth it out further, but it's perfectly drinkable already.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Owned by the Vialard family, this is a very fine wine. While it does have strong wood flavors at this young stage, they are going to be there to support the ripe jammy fruit. The wine from this 111-acre estate is generous and is going to age well. Drink from 2022.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Lucky Failla gets to source grapes from this vineyard that most winemakers would trade their left arm for. It's lush, ripe and amazingly generous in raspberries and cherries, yet retains an elegant balance, as well as fine, mouthwatering acidity. Part of the attraction is low alcohol, which lets the stones and earthy complexities of the wine shine through. This is really a brilliant wine—light, delicate and powerful. If you want to age it for eight years or so, you won't be sorry.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a very interesting wine. It has many different flavor threads that have not quite interwoven. To begin there is a surplus of acid, leaving a chalky sensation that has not yet smoothed out. The fruit flavors are also sharp and tart—red fruits from wild berries to pomegranate to sour cherry. The aromas suggest some light chocolate from the barrel aging, and it shows up in the finish, along with herb and vanilla. So, there's lots going on, but it has not yet come together in a harmonious whole.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Dried fruit aromas of prune, fig and nearly raisin show on the nose of this red, which is enhanced by savory touches of salt, pepper and leather. There is a pleasant rustic quality to the sip, but a strong bitterness reminiscent of bittersweet chocolate, underripe plum skins and coffee grinds arises midpalate and doesn't dissipate.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a serious Kosher Cab. Medium garnet in color with intense aromas of blackberry, dark plum and cherry accented by notes of cigar box and licorice. The mouth offers a similar mélange of flavors, with a full and lush texture and gripping tannins. Long, lingering finish. Enjoy now through 2012.",Israel-Galilee-Cabernet Sauvignon
"From one of California’s coolest growing regions, the grapes nonetheless achieved the ripeness of white peaches, lending those notes to the aromas and flavors. It’s very clean and refreshing. There’s a nice toastiness that carries through to the finish, which is slightly sweet and bitter. To be released Spring 2001.",US-California-Champagne Blend
"Fresh, crisp and fruity, this is a raspberry- and red currant-flavored wine that is featherlight and refreshing. It's a great summer wine.",France-Southwest France-Rosé

"This plummy, dusty red wine is simple and straightforward in its approach to tannin and oak. Offered at a fair price it should please a wide range of palates.",US-California-Red Blend
"This 100% varietal wine is the winery's inaugural Cabernet Sauvignon and hails from the Rocks District. It's boasts all of Cabernet's prototypical aromas, from black currant to tobacco and herb, with a kiss of vanilla from having aged in 50% new French oak. It's soft and palate-coating in mouthfeel yet retains a strong sense of structure, with lightly chewy tannins. A fine interpretation of the variety with a downright dazzling feel.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Right away, this smells smooth and complete, with a proper mix of berry fruit, oak and earthy aromas. This is Salentein winemaker José Galante's personal wine, and it's juicy on the palate and doesn't overreach. Blackberry, boysenberry and salty, meaty notes finish with a persistent dose of salt, which should make this all the more appropriate when served with beef. Drink through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec

Exhibiting the perfect balance of restrained minerality, meaty, smoky spice and full, delicious fruit, the wine ends with studied finesse. Pure class throughout.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Red Blend

"Sweet basic cherry aromas are candied at first and then darker with airing. The palate is bold, juicy, a little aggressive and herbal, with ample berry and plum fruit at the base. Oaky and long on the finish, with a peppery, herbal ending.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"Aromas of blackberry, blue flower and a whiff of aniseed lead the nose. The medium-bodied palate offers ripe black cherry, vanilla, clove, white pepper and grilled herb alongside assertive, tightly knit tannins that leave a rather astringent finish. Drink 2016–2021.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Barely off dry, this wine is rich and very perfumed, hinting at an attractive light oxidation from the wood aging. Almonds, white fruits and a fine, tight texture round it out. It will age, so drink from 2014.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"Bring this down to the cellar and let it sleep for at least 5–6 years. It's super-tannic, giving a hard, angular mouthfeel, even though the blackberry, cherry, currant and cedar flavors are powerful. It just wants to throw some sediment and let that mountain fruit shine.",US-California-Merlot
"A vivid gold color and spice-rack aromas like nutmeg and cardamom add a different twist to this medium-bodied and rather rich-textured wine. Those are probably characteristics from aging with oak, and they enhance the clean, fresh fruit flavors in a good way.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Citrus, confectioner's sugar and papaya are the opening act for this simple but pleasant sparkler. It's light in the mouth, with noticeable sweetness but a kick of lemony acidity at the end leaves you feeling refreshed. Drink soon, preferably while watching the tide come in.",Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"The hard limestone and chalk soil has given this wine its distinctive minerality and wonderful acidity. Rich and juicy, it has intense yellow and green fruits that are laced with lime acidity. The wine has depth with concentrated fruitiness. Drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"A pleasant rose-petal pink in color, this wine by regional sparkling veteran Norm Yost shows red-grapefruit pulp and skin, lime spritz and a shred of bubble gum on the nose, playing both on hedonism and restraint. It's extremely refreshing once sipped, with more lime and pink grapefruit zest.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This medium-bodied red from county-wide sources is herbaceous, offering dry, somewhat green tannin and lingering spiciness of black pepper.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

It's a full-bodied, slightly oily wine, delivering pear, melon and pineapple flavors tinged with cinnamon and brown sugar. Drink now.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style White Blend
"This inky, dense Brunello delivers rich opulence and velvety cherry-berry nuances. Cassis, ripe raspberries and currants are followed by dark chocolate and exotic spice. The wine shows great balance too, especially between acidity and tannin.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Spicy aromas of green tobacco blend with plum and berry notes. This Merlot is drying and tannic on the palate. Leafy flavors are fairly green, with generic black-fruit notes keeping it afloat.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Merlot
"Rossojbleo opens with distinct aromas of oatmeal cookie, Graham cracker and bright red fruit. It's a unique expression, with just enough acidity to keep the plate refreshed.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"This is rich and appealing, vast in flavor and luxurious in texture. It shows Oakville character in its smooth, velvety tannins and overall balance, with ripe blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors. If you can keep from drinking it now, it should hold in the cellar for 10–15 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Crisp acids and finely ground tannins give this young Cab great structure, making it feel balanced and elegant. It's also a very ripe wine, showing lush blackberry, cassis and cherry flavors. The wine is big enough to easily support its significant amount of flashy new oak. Drink now through 2010.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Slightly grassy herbal-leaning plum and berry aromas include a note of pencil shavings. This feels solid and not too heavy. Roasted berry and cassis flavors don't vary or evolve in front of a slightly reedy tasting finish. Drink this maturing, middle-aged Malbec through 2019.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Extra-ordinarily sweet, with fantastic honey, apricot, pineapple, orange marmalade, buttered toast and vanilla cream flavors. What's not to like? Could be more complex, but dazzles for sheer decadence.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon
"An appealing wine with notes of herbs, gooseberry and guava. It's medium-bodied with some residual sugar (1.2 g/L) helping it go down easy.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"Ostensibly a Central Otago producer, Rabbit Ranch sources the fruit for its Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough. The result is a lemony, grapefruity wine, with subdued herbal notes lurking in the background. It's medium in body, with a crisp, citrusy finish. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Mineral aromas of gravel, graphite and crushed slate show on the nose of this bottling, leading into baked black plum and oak notes. It's a refreshing example from an appellation that tends toward richer, jammy styles. The palate offers raspberry and dried thyme flavors, with a touch of eucalyptus.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Dusty in cocoa powder and leather, this is a dusty mountain of a Zin, from old Foothills vines. Soft and racy, enjoy with pizza or creamy lasagna.",US-California-Zinfandel

"From one of the most ocean-adjacent vineyards in the state, this is a swarthy and powerful bottling, showing black plum, violet, olive and coffee touches on the concentrated nose.

"A bit of dust and leather for openers, with short black-fruit flavors and a big wave of tannins on the palate. So expect some grab and choppiness. Despite moderate hardness, there's good dark fruit and limited herbal intrusion.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"While not the most structured vintage of Beaucastel, this is a full-bodied, creamy-textured rendering of Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

"This is extreme Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir, from an Annapolis-area vineyard.

Floral upon entry, the wine proffers subtle yet ample acidity and relatively low alcohol.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"This is an easy, fruity wine made from Grenache. It has a clean, bright character, reflecting its red currant fruitiness and crispness.",France-France Other-Rosé
"There are some overripened notes in this Zin that lift the blackberries into raisins. There's also some heat, making the wine taste higher in alcohol than it is. Drink this strong, heady Zin with barbecue.",US-California-Zinfandel

"One word describes this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend—huge. It's thick and dense in the mouth, with considerable tannins framing ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, currants, green olives, mocha and toasty oak. In need of aging, it should begin to mellow after 2018.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is the most expensive of the winery's new Cabs. It's also the fruitiest and most in need of time in the cellar. Right now, it's a candied blast of blackberries and cherries. The tannins are sweet and chunky, and the oak isn't integrated with everything else. It's awkward. But it should develop for a good 6–8 years, maybe even longer. The score reflects its potential.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a Portuguese classic. Made in a structured style, it is dry with plenty of tannins under the fruit. It is a real food wine, with its black-currant flavors firmly under control. The wine will be ready to drink from late 2017.",Portugal-Alentejo-Portuguese Red
"Aromas of leather, rubber and plastic get this off to a shaky start. The palate has protruding acids and flavors of raspberry, plum and oak resin. An herbal flavor and freshness drive the finish.

"This is a ripe wine that includes Chardonnay and Viognier in its blend. It has yellow fruits that are cut with plenty of acidity. A cool, crisp element reminds that the vineyards are close to the ocean. The wine is ready to drink.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese White
"The aromas are of dark honey—there's almost a roasted quality to them that verges on caramel. The flavors follow in a similar vein, suggesting roasted pineapple and caramelized peach, while the mouthfeel is pleasantly rich and filling.",Germany-Mosel-Saar-Ruwer-Riesling
"A big wine, in the Ledson style, whose power comes at the cost of some elegance. Its dominant note is fruit—ripe and jammy in blackberries and chocolate—as well as sweet oak. Impressive for sheer mass, but would benefit from some restraint.",US-California-Merlot
"An absolutely delicious wine. It's like a fine Pinot Noir in the silky texture, yet deeper and bolder, almost Grenache-like, in the blackberries, cherries and currants, with tangy notes of oranges and vanilla. Dry and richly tannic, this is one of the few Sangioveses that's perfectly ripe and eminently drinkable. Drink now.",US-California-Sangiovese
"This wine is powerful enough to serve with wild boar carpaccio, if there is such a thing, or with blue cheese like a Port. The color is unusually dark and opaque, a stark black with a faintly purple rim. It smells spicy and tastes very concentrated, like blackberry jam, wood smoke and black pepper. The texture is almost thick and drenched with fine tannins while the body is quite full as well.",US-California-Red Blend
"A slight herbal lemon balm note marks the nose of this wine. Its light, dry palate is fresh and thirst-quenching, needing only an ice bucket and a few rays of sunshine.",Austria-Wagram-Grüner Veltliner
"An aromatic wine with abundant notes of ripe white peach, apricot, mineral and flowers. It drinks off dry (10.7 g/L residual sugar) with a pleasing sense of tension between the acid and stone fruit flavors leading to a long, persistent finish.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Smells sort of furry and earthy initially, with notes of graphite and woodspice. Feels narrow and grabby, with pointed acididty framing red plum, cherry and lightly oaky, minty flavors. Fits the definition of good but regular Malbec.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Concentrated, compact aromas of black fruits are generous but also monotonous and low on character. A big, bulky palate is round but offers enough acidic kick to keep everything above water. Baked, flat flavors of black fruits and roasted meat finish smooth but low on pulse. Drink through 2017.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Softly layered, this ripe, bold wine shows a wealth of body and complexity. The ripeness will please for its interwoven notions of Dr Pepper, black-cherry jam and black pepper, its tannins leathery and full of bravado.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Extra Brut on the label indicates that the Champagne is very dry, and this wine is certainly that. But it also benefits from bottle age to soften the vivid acidity. The flavors are moving into a secondary phase, bringing almonds and yeast to the forefront, keeping creamy apple behind. It is ripe and full, definitely for food.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This lightly perfumed wine is crisp and clear. Apple and pear flavors are attractively packaged in fresh acidity and an orange-peel tang. The wine is still young, with its tight aftertaste, so wait until later in 2015 to drink.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese White
"Co-fermented with 10% Petite Sirah, this red certainly impresses. With a fruity entry, it meets a leathery tightness on the midpalate, its mix of cherry and orange confounding expectations of darker expression from the varieties with its rose-tinged aromas. Spicy pepper rounds out the finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"So rich and ripe, it's practically a good group. Blended from Petite Verdot, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it offers waves of cherries, pomegranates and currants, intrigued with herb, mushroom and floral notes, and finishes long and spicy. An interesting, compelling Bordeaux-style wine that's fine to drink now, and should pick up bottle complexities over the next six years.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A subdued nose leads onto a very lively palate dominated by foaming, big and frothy bubbles. There is an edge of bitterness but the fruit flavors are fresh and reminiscent of red apple and forest berries. Drink soon.",France-Alsace-Pinot Noir

"Winemaker Jacques Grange produces relatively small quantities of this blend of 70% Grenache and 10% each of Bourboulenc, Clairette and Viognier. It's moderately weighty, but also refreshing, with bright notes of pineapple, star anise and balsam fir. Drink it over the next six months.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style White Blend
"This is an intense wine, robustly ripe and showy in oak. It tastes of baked apple and vanilla wood.",US-California-Chardonnay

"The aromas of apricot, drizzled honey, lime and pear are followed by off-dry, lightly spritzy stone-fruit flavors that linger.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Knights Valley continues to be a fine spot for this variety, as evidenced by this wine, which is extremely vibrant in grassy lemon zest and melon. A pure expression of the grape, it offers enough oomph to remain consistent and textured, ending with a succulent suggestion of apricot.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Bottled with a trippy-looking label that promotes the brand's spiritual bent, this wine has a nose that conveys elegant eucalyptus, purple flowers, fresh pomegranate, wild mint, sage and pencil shavings. Savory roasting herbs and spice show on the palate, from black pepper to oregano and thyme, then warm up toward cherry pie with black cardamom. It finishes crisp.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This savory blend of 70% Nero d'Avola and 30% Syrah opens with aromas ripe blackberry, sour cherry and wild strawberry that all carry over to the palate alongside hints of black pepper and cocoa. The juicy fruit is balanced by smooth, supple tannins.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"The ample alcohol in this wine imparts a rich slightly syrupy feel to this wine that's not particularly Pinot-like, but still satisfying. Strawberry and raspberry notes carry a hint of tomato leaf, then finish with crisp acids.",Australia-South Australia-Pinot Noir
"A bit on the hot side, reflecting the extra warmth that the Pope Valley region of eastern Napa Valley gets during the summer. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's massively flavored, huge in jammy blackberries, cherries, cassis and dark chocolate. The tannins are considerable, the finish long and ripe. Best to open this wine by 2015 or so.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is fresh, fruity and with an attractive creamy texture. The crisp apple comes from the high-acid Rabigato grape that's softened by Viosinho and Gouveio. That makes for a balanced, light wine that is ready to drink.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White

"This has attractive peach and floral aromas and flavors, medium to full body, and a soft texture that is bolstered slightly by appley acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a delicate sweet Riesling, honeyed and with intense acidity as a foil. The wine is delicate, holding back on its richness with a light touch, and very poised. The wine is destined for aging over at least six years and more. Screwcap.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Riesling
"Whiffs of stem and smoke blow off with aeration, revealing bright lemon and apple notes on this off-dry Riesling. It's refreshingly brisk with acidity, along with a slightly herbaceous tone that lingers.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"The nose of this wine is marked by funky game, moist earth, stewed plum and wet fur aromas. That gamy note follows through to the palate, which is rustic and raisin-inflected with hints of grilled herb and used leather. Grainy tannins leave a raspy finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Coniale is one of those beautifully balanced Italian Cabs that is plush and dense, but elegant and fine at the same time.

"Aged in French oak for 10 months (10% new, 90% second fill), this is a toasty yet balanced selection.

"Winemaker Jesse Katz combines 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc in this blockbuster of a deal, a flavorful, well-crafted wine that impresses in its voluptuous body and spicy seasonings.

"90-92 Barrel sample. Owned by Château Angélus, a soft and gentle wine, wearing its fruit on its sleeve, the tannins light, followed by a juicy texture.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) makes this cuvée for Le Cadeau, and it's a triumph in this vintage. Cherry fruit ripe to the point of syrup hogs the flavor spotlight, but there's cranberry and raspberry too, putting a tangy note into the mix. Root beer and sweet cola elements combine, and there is little doubt that, good as it is already, this is a wine to cellar. Drink now–2028.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Dark, meaty aromas of blackberry, boysenberry, herbs and spice pave the way for a jammy, tannic palate that's jumbled in feel. Blueberry, mint, herb and briny flavors finish blocky, with herbal notes and heat. Drink this big-bodied offering through 2023.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo

"This Harlequin has a faint scent of lemon liqueur that's offset by a white pepper note. The medium-weight palate offers a lemon blossom hint, and it finishes on the short side.",US-Virginia-Chardonnay

Drink this rock-solid specimen now through 2016.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec

"Much improved, with different vineyard sources than in 2004, this strong, varietal Cabernet mixes cassis, black cherry, light herb and hints of moist earth.

The acidity at the end is bright and refreshing.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"Produced at a Domaine that is run by the Arnoux family, the wine has both a rich side and a firm side.

Drink this dense wine from 2020.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This is a very rich Syrah, dramatically layered in blackberry, bitter cherry skin, dark chocolate, grilled prosciutto and pepper flavors.

"Dark, minty and fiery on first take, this folds in aromas of licorice and oaky lemon peel along with spicy berry fruit.

The palate is also down the middle, with earth, wood and dark fruit all present, framed by strong acidity and firm but not overwhelming tannins.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Cignale, or wild boar is one of Tuscany's best expressions of Cabernet Sauvignon. A small percentage of   Merlot is added for softness and flavor and the wine oozes darkness, blackberry and exotic spice at its core. Pair it with game meat or spicy pork sausage.",Italy-Tuscany-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Hayflowers and savory lovage and arugula notes, inflected with piquant lime zest create an irresistibly spicy palate of such lightness and ease, there is a spring in the step of this light but intensely flavoured wine.

"This is a generous mouthful of Cabernet, with just small amounts of Merlot and Carmenère in the blend.

Her 2011, an unusual blend of fruit from Napa Valley and Paso Robles, is a real crowd pleaser.

"Light, pleasant apple aromas are about all this neutral Chardonnay is giving. Its mild palate with just enough acidity carries clean and easy melon flavors. A slightly briny note closes out the lean finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Chardonnay
"A simple but delicious Grüner Veltliner from terraced vineyards above the city of Stein. It's very fresh, but has a full-textured character, with kiwis and some spice. The finish is delicious clear and green. Glass stopper.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"This is very light, in both flavor and body. The aromas are earthy, with a faint suggestion of blackberries, and the mouthfeel is thin. These aren't terrible flaws, but the wine just lacks substance.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Leather, black pepper and fresh compost shock the nose in this at-first fruit-shy, light-bodied endeavor, bright in acidity and a refreshing minerality. Cinnamon and vanilla season the subtle blackberry and raspberry.",US-California-Charbono
"Though not one of the producer's single-vineyard bottlings, this estate blend manages to stun the nose and palate nonetheless. Tart mulberry, Kalamata olive, hibiscus, rose hips, red plum and sandalwood aromas wrestle attention immediately, then the sip delivers bergamot, cedar ash, exotic cranberry and rosemary depth. It delivers an excellent combination of wood, fruit and herb.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Tomato leaf, cut grass and tropical fruit aromas lead the nose on this racy, linear wine. The vibrant, savory palate doles out juicy yellow grapefruit, yellow peach and a mineral note while lively acidity leaves a crisp, clean finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon

"This wine is a blend of Merlot (60%), Cabernet Sauvignon (35%) and Cabernet Franc. Brooding aromas of blackberry, black currant, herb and spice lead to rich ripe hedonistic black-fruit flavors that bring a compelling sense of texture. It's not shy, but for those looking for a big bold ripe wine, this one's for you.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The wine is ripe and soft, with a style that is more towards tropical fruits. So apricots, ripe pears are cut with crisp acidity. The wine is tangy at the end with orange zest flavors. Drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This Cab is nearing the end of its useful life. The raspberry and cherry flavors are starting to pick up a mushroomy note. It's not unpleasant, adding a rich, loamy earthiness to the fruit, but the wine doesn't have much time left.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fermented in a mix of stainless steel barrels and neutral oak barrels, this was fermented with native yeast and given sur lie aging. It went through 100% malolactic fermentation, which has softened the mid-palate, a mix of lemon, grapefruit and Satsuma orange. There are still traces of phenolic bite, but those citrus rind flavors have been well rounded also, though this carries some heat in the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Simple lime and salinic aromas are clean and fresh. The palate is juicy and tight, with lime, apple and dry spice flavors. Finishes balanced and citrusy, with proper length and mouthfeel. A good but regular Cava that's done right for the price.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"As is often the case when a rosé has been made taking the color from the skins rather than the more usual addition of red wine, this perfumed Champagne is dark colored—very pink. The fruit of this dry wine gives a red-currant flavor, with lively acidity and a crisp, tang aftertaste.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This is appealing for its flavors of fresh-sliced Bosch pear, plus a pear-like graininess on the palate. It has some residual sugar, just enough to round out the acids, and overall it's a nicely balanced wine drinking very well right now.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"A powerful wine, showing rich, opulent Chardonnay. The spice and acidity crispen the wine, but leave the powerful fruit in all its glory.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A classic Nebbiolo fragrance of red rose, perfumed berry, baking spice and a whiff of earth emerges on this stunning wine. Firm, polished tannins weave through the elegantly structured palate, effortlessly supporting juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and star anise while bright acidity keeps it fresh. It's still young and needs to unwind before it can fully develop. Drink 2019–2032.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This classy example opens with a very floral nose and almost flower-shop aromas. But it’s not at all sweet on the palate, as tangy lime quickly moves to the fore. Impressively light and elegant, it displays some unusual elements and has a fine bead as well as a supple, herb-tinged finish.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Using fruit sourced from 94-year-old vines, this is a powerful and concentrated wine. It has a serious, complex mix of fruit and tannin, with notes of leather and spice that lend power and density. Age this for at least another year.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Balsam, menthol, spice and black and red berry aromas with hints of mint lead the nose on this wine. The palate offers subtle red cherry, prune, tea and tobacco alongside velvety but rather fleeting tannins. It closes on a drying, astringent note.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Reflecting the cool 2013 harvest, this top Chardonnay is sophisticated and subtle, without the over-the-top power of the previous vintage.

Delicious already, it will likely improve through 2021.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"This is a fruity wine, full of acidity, ripe tannins and just touches of new wood. With the structural weight, it has some potential, leaving a fruity, fresher aftertaste.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Hearty aromas of plum and dried black cherries are bolstered by warm cedar tones, a touch of tar, crushed peppercorns and chopped garden herbs. The palate is complex, with lots of acidity and peppery spice, showing flavors of oregano and marjoram on a base of plum fruit. It's dense with flavors but medium in body, and very lively.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This opens with generous aromatic fullness and brightness, with notes of black cherry, spice, leather and tobacco. The oak notes are still obvious so give this wine five more years of cellar aging.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"This is rounded, soft and textured with spice and pepper. Acidity gives freshness while leaving the wine full in the mouth and generous in character. It's for drinking now.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Here's a southern Italian red with Barolo-like austerity: elegant notes of small berry fruit are seamlessly folded within layers of slate roof, ash, graphite, licorice and fine expressions rendered by volcanic soils and 18 months of oak aging. It really comes alive in the mouth, where the wine delivers power, concentration and a very long-lasting finish. This is Mastroberardino's flagship red.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"This rosé has aromas of toast and walnut. It's bitter and dry, and lacks the fruit richness to balance its lean and astringent sensations.",Italy-Lombardy-Sparkling Blend

"The wine shows interesting oxidation and toast from the Savagnin grape in the blend. It has creamed apple and zesty bitter orange flavors as well as tight, nervy acidity.",France-France Other-Sparkling Blend
"If a rosé can be serious, this is it. Named after the owner, it is a structured, concentrated wine with a dense texture and hints of tannin. It also is fruity, perfumed and refreshing. The edge of pepper does betray the alcohol although that is offset by intense final acidity.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Golden delicious apple and pear aromas open this round, somewhat loosely knit wine. Tastes a bit sweet, and decidedly more ripe than anticipated, even a touch mature. Has a good bead and an orange note on the finish.",US-California-Champagne Blend
"A slip of sour cherry gives zing to this medium-acidity, fruit-forward wine that's both earthy and pinched in toasted oak.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A wide-open, friendly wine, all delicious rich white fruits and tropical flavors. While it may not be ageworthy, it is a pleasure now, an opulent mouthful of Chardonnay.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

Flavors of red plums and berries are boosted with toastiness.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend

"This is the first of 15 estates the Gonfrier family owns throughout Bordeaux. There are strong wood influences here, although the fruit is enough to match up. So ripe pear and apricot flavors go with those toasty characters to give a rich, full-bodied wine. It will be better from late 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Call this Pinot useful, rather than complex or ageable. It's nicely dry, acidic and silky in the mouth, with jammy raspberry, cherry and persimmon flavors. Food pairings range from steak to tuna tartare or a bacon burger.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Weil's standard-label Spätlese shares the same core of minerality that its single-vineyard siblings boast, but in a slightly earthier, more rustic style marked by heady whiffs of pollen, saffron and spice. It's a thirst quencher, light-footed and sheer on the palate, finishing with an exhilarating array grapefruit, lime and tangerine flavors.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling

Tasted twice, with consistent results.",New Zealand-Hawke's Bay-Syrah
"A cool vintage shows through in the lighter style of this Merlot. Strawberry is the dominant fruit flavor, although the time in new oak is what dominates currently. The scent and vanilla flavor of American oak, though accounting just 20% of the barrels, comes across quite powerfully. Give this one another year or two.",US-Washington-Merlot

"There is a high-toned aspect to the otherwise neutral nose that just gives away lemony hints. The palate is sprightly and fresh and reveals a very creamy, fruity, almost tropical core which is cut very pleasantly by fresh, aromatic lemon—this is Chardonnay but not as you know it.

Spiced orange, lemon custard and fresh honeycomb all grace the long, evolving finish. Drink now–2020.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Chardonnay

"This blend of 60% Petit Verdot, 15% Malbec, 15% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon offers a grape-driven nose, boosted by dried black cherry, licorice and baking spice, more playful than brooding. Bright flavors of blackberry and red cherry make for a juicy, tangy wine with decent tannic structure.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is an earthy, somewhat flat wine with herbal berry aromas that fall away in quiet form. A full, grabby palate brings berry, raisin and tobacco flavors, all supported by a modest beam of acidity. A finish of earth, tobacco and mulchy flavors announce that 2009 was indeed a hot vintage in Chile.",Chile-Maule Valley-Red Blend
"This is the brand's first bottling under new ownership, and the result of this blend of Monterey, Sonoma and Santa Barbara county fruit is familiarly ripe—due in part to the inclusion of 10% Merlot, 6% Chardonnay and 2% Syrah.

The tense palate delivers wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice, ground pepper and tobacco alongside a firm backbone of tightly woven, ultrafine tannins.

"Pleasant cherry, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors mark this bone dry Pinot Noir. It's a little harsh in texture, with sharp acids and tannins defining a certain rustic style from California.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This smells like a typical Mosel kabinett, offering up hints of crushed stone and fresh flower-shop greenery. It's styled appropriately, with modest alcohol and a hint of residual sugar. It just lacks the extra flash of fruit and acidity needed to raise it to the next level, leaving it a good if somewhat commercial effort.",Germany-Mosel-Saar-Ruwer-Riesling

Wait to drink this wine for a few more years, at least until 2018.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of wild berry, pressed violet, leather, underbrush and a balsamic note lead the nose.

The warmth of alcohol is evident on the midpalate. Drink 2017–2022.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese

Despite its serious heft, the wine feels comfortable in the mouth. Indisputably an ager, it should begin to mellow after 2018, and continue to offer pleasure for many years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A vineyard-designate since 2007, this wine shows vigor and volatility in the glass, a mix of white pepper, heightened acidity and an underlay of black tea and forest floor.

"Fragrant and soft, this wine carries a gentle floral fragrance—crushed roses—into a midpalate of bright raspberry and cherry. It turns a little leathery in the mouth, astringent but with the cherry flavors persisting, suggesting that further bottle age will soften it and add more textural complexity.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"It's a shame that the producer used too much wood in this difficult vintage. The fruit is delicate, with the black-currant flavors and acidity smothered by a burnt, toasty character that's hard to taste through. It will soften, although the wood will always be there.

"The iconoclastic Emilio Rojo produces this five-grape blend from terraced vineyards located in inland Galicia. The wine is lush, rich and shows barrel characteristics and depth.

"This is dry, silky and enormously complex, with flavors of raspberry, cherry, cola, new oak and spice that satisfy through the long finish. The mountain vineyard concentrated the fruit, yielding savory power. It's a beautiful Pinot Noir to drink now with steaks or lamb chops.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Rich in fruit and oak, but balanced with crisp acidity. It's strongly flavored, brimming with pineapple jam, white peach, apricot, buttered toast and vanilla. Gets the Chardonnay job done with some elegance.",US-California-Chardonnay
"With a healthy 17% Malbec in the mix, this is the producer's top-tier still wine, from a range of vineyard blocks above its winery. Named for one of its founders, Jack Davies, it does him proud, combining spicy clove, cinnamon and black fruit around a fulsome, tannic and concentrated body with structure to age. It finishes with elegance and peppery spice.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This bottling by the respected Silverado winery has been consistent over the years. The 2009 vintage is unsurprisingly quite good and drinkable, with elegance. It's a soft wine, with a creamy mouthfeel framing black cherry, mocha and oak flavors. Ready now.",US-California-Merlot
"Plum, cinnamon, Chinese five spice, egg nog, strawberry compote and sour cherry team up for a memorable nose. The palate proves more straight-ahead and savory, with sandalwood up front and fleshy plum, cooked rhubarb and some strawberry in the background.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"If the modern California style of exceptionally ripe fruit and sweet, smoky oak appeals to you, you'll love this wine. It's an explosion of pineapple jam, tangerine and vanilla cream flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Not very subtle, but flamboyant. Calling all shellfish to the dance floor.",US-California-Chardonnay
"While there is certainly plenty of wood here, the wine has weight and impressive concentration for the year. The tannins are still brooding away, giving a dark firm character to the wine. Blackberry fruits and acidity are there, but still well buried in the tannins.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Basic peach and melon aromas come with lettuce and white pepper accents. The palate runs a little soft and low on acid and bubbles, while the flavor profile is sweet, with lime and apple at the core. A standard, basic Cava.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"A steely mix of raspberries and cherries frames the core fruit with tart citrus. There's a hint of gunmetal, along with tight well-ripened tannins. Solid winemaking all around.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"Effervescent lemon, lime and grapefruit and a flinty edge define this crisp white, aged mostly in stainless steel. A ripe, unctuous finish gives the wine subtle power and voluptuousness.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This abundantly rich wine seems to melt in the mouth like fine dark chocolate. Aromas emphasize fully ripe plums, black cherries and a whiff of spicy oak. Then chocolaty flavors expand quickly on the tongue as they are carried by copious soft tannins. While big in flavor it's modest in body and alcohol.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine highlights heady new-oak tones of spice, vanilla and cedar, yet maintains elegance from nose to finish. Ripe black cherry and plum flavors penetrate on the palate, with a framing of soft tannins and bright cranberry acidity. The finish is long and a touch mineral.",US-New York-Pinot Noir

"Peach blossoms, fresh apricot, light jasmine and a warm white peach cream character show on the nose of this bottling.

"Rugged rustic gritty aromas of roasted plum, saddle leather and baked beans may cause some head scratching. Speaking of scratch, this is scratchy on the palate and a bit weak in the middle. Flavors of stewed berry fruits and rubber finish with grating tannins.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A bit light in aromas, this appellation blend slowly shows dried cranberry, slight raspberry, juniper and wet earth. The clean but simple flavors surround iron, more dried cranberry and a pinch of dried herbs.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot, 13% Petit Verdot and 7% Malbec is warm and inviting on the nose, with baked blueberry, caramel, vanilla and violet touches. The palate continues its purple flavor theme with a core of blueberry fruit, but dried herb and mocha spice provide more complex layers.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"There's extra richness across the palate of perfectly ripened apple, pear and melon fruit. The weight of the wine in the mouth is substantial but maintains a sense of lightness and proportion, and the finish extends out gracefully as long as you can wait for that next sip.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Wakefield (known as Taylors in Australia) was founded in Clare with the goal of producing world-class Cabernet Sauvignon, so it's no surprise this wine is a solid effort. Cassis and black-tea notes are carried easily by the medium body and dusty tannins that turn silkier on the finish. Drink now–2025.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe, rich fruit flavors and a handsome streak of spicy oak make this full-bodied Rhône-style blend luscious and tempting. Great fruit concentration and a nicely viscous texture team up with soft tannins and an almost-sweet finish.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This cuvée is principally from the estate (Appassionata) vineyard. Lush, spicy and spread broadly across the palate, it pleases with strawberry-raspberry fruit, milk chocolate and a dusting of cocoa powder. The wine does seem to lighten up rather quickly at the finish, but further bottle age may fix that.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A rich wine, very balanced with ripe peach flavors enlivened by acidity, orange zest and an edge of spice. The wine is lush while also mineral and will likely develop over the next 3–4 years. The aftertaste is gorgeous and very ripe.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"Incredibly ripe and sweet apricots, candied orange peel, a touch of fresh spearmint and fresh lemon zest all abound on the nose, and are just the first expressions. Balm-like sweetness and clouds of more apricot and peach play on the palate, but electric acidity runs straight through and lends this rich and unctuous TBA the thrilling freshness and streamlined zestiness of candied citrus peel, finishing with long, lip-smacking deliciousness. Unlike treacly sweet TBAs, this has exquisite freshness and is very enlivening, with real citrus lift. Drink from 2016.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling

"This Cab is drinking very dry, tannic and austere in its youth. It really needs time in the cellar to soften and throw some sediment, and allow the heart of black currants and dark chocolate to emerge. Should begin to show interest after 2013.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Has peach, banana and vanilla aromas on the nose; palate shows light yellow fruit, plus a sour peach-pit note, both of which continue through to the finish. Body is medium, with some viscosity.",Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"This is a typically fragrant and fresh Grüner but with great class. It's very ripe and fruity, with acidity that offers a refreshing line of citrus. The Hundsleiten Vineyard's minerality comes through strongly here with a steely texture that finishes the wine with dryness. It's an impressive wine for aging over the next 2–4 years. Screwcap.",Austria-Weinviertel-Grüner Veltliner
"From the sought-after site on Westside Road, this wine delivers a nuanced, elegant expression of juicy red cherry, plum, pomegranate and light, compelling spice.

"Here's a structured Rosso that offers aromas of underbrush, black plum, berry and orange zest. Bright red cherry takes center stage on the palate, while notes of mint, Mediterranean herbs and sweet spices add interest. It's tannic but shy on fresh acidity so enjoy now.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Clean mineral notes blend nicely with fresh berry fruit, red rose and raspberry. This is a simple but genuine wine that would pair with roasted fish or vegetable risotto.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Lagrein
"From the 1904 planting at Puccioni Ranch, this impressive wine packs tons of flavor in a soft, peppery, integrated package of red fruit and baking spice. Though weighty and robust, it has an underlying acidity to lend freshness and vibrancy.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Bold and smoky, this offers tart, tight cherry and brambly berry fruit. The juicy acidity is counterpointed with a certain chalkiness. A whiff of truffle further complements the fruit. It's a sleek wine with surprising power.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A good everyday wine. It's dry, full-bodied and has enough berry-cherry flavors to get by, wrapped into a smooth texture.",US-California-Merlot
"This blends 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Syrah from estate-farmed vineyards, the result a mix of cured meat, charred oak and rich, dark cherry. Full bodied and concentrated, it offers structure amid the ripeness.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"Ripe, baked, raisiny aromas of blackberry, coconut, resiny oak, tomato sauce and herbs set up a racy, high-intensity palate with flavors of berry, fig and blackened spices. The finish is rooty in flavor, with notes of licorice and chocolate offset by sharp residual acidity.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinto Fino

"Creamy notes hover over red apple on the beautifully dry palate. The body is rounded and almost rich, with a touch of bitterness creeping into the autolytic, bready background. This is rounded enough for food and will be very versatile, especially with roast or grilled salmon dishes.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"Producer of one of the first rosé Vinho Verde, Casa do Valle continues to make one of the best. Full of delicious strawberry flavors with great acidity, deliciously fruity.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Rosé
"The delicate opening scents are broom, beeswax and pear. The thin palate is made up of yellow apple skin, dried herb and a hint of almond alongside nervous acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Friulano
"Gentle notes of creaminess and ripe pears signal a soft, creamy wine with lots of texture and body. The rounded body carries some weight and is edged with a bitter marzipan note. All this is countered by fresh acidity, more creamy, nutty notes and a vanilla finish.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"Ripe and fruity, this is a soft cru wine full of cherry and red-berry flavors. It has an acid core firmed up by a smattering of tannins. Mainly though it is a lively, crisp wine that is ready to drink.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Initial sweetness, followed by attractive soft fruit, this is a rich, balanced wine, golden in color. In addition to the richness, there is good fresh acidity, a layer of old wood that adds complexity. Very stylish.",Portugal-Port-Port
Roasted berry aromas are stalky at first but come around. This feels round but only marginally structured. Creamy ripe generic flavors of berry and cherry finish solid with some heat.,Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A very agreeable, satisfying blend of ripe fruit and firm texture makes this full-bodied wine a winner. It has enough concentration to drench the palate with blackberries and linger on the finish with cinnamon accents.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The nose on this bottling is classic for the grape: blackberry, dried lilacs, wet asphalt, beef char and black rocks. The palate is more muddled, with flavors of clay and freshly turned earth, without much spice or fruit to note.",US-California-Syrah
"Big-hearted wine, full of warm and rich fruit. It has a solid core of dusty tannins, black plum fruit flavors and a delicious, chewy, juicy texture. It does have power as well as intense fruitiness. Age for 3–4 years.",France-Southwest France-Malbec-Merlot

"The famed winery comes a bit south to make this earthy, savory wine, with smoked sage, leather, forest floor, cherry and slate on the nose. The palate packs elegantly tart cranberry and pure flavors of sage-smoked wild cherry with the juicy elements of an herb-crusted pork tenderloin roast.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"More orange or lightly blush than straw-hued, this is a fine single-vineyard wine. It's bone-dry, complex and sophisticated, with persistent pear and peach skin flavors, offering more detail and less obvious fruit than most Oregon Pinot Gris.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"This may only weigh in at 12% abv, but the flavors are nicely ripened, ranging from gooseberry and peach to citrus. It's medium in weight, with a refreshing, mouthwatering finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"A rich and luscious wine that has sweet tannins, blackberry fruits and ripe tannins. It's a complex wine, elegant with full fruits, juicy acidity and a strong, firm textured core. Big and full-bodied, this is a wine that can age. It is drinkable now and until 2020.",Portugal-Douro-Touriga Nacional

"This soft wine features attractive citrus and creamed-apple flavors. It is round, full, lightly spicy and presents an easy, immediately drinkable character.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
Strange aromas emanate from this wine. They point to meat and gravy rather than fruit. So it's a shock to find that the wine is all fruitiness and crisp apple and pear acidity. It's a very textured and needs to age. Drink from 2016.,France-France Other-Savagnin
"This Bordeaux-style blend of 25% Merlot, 25% Malbec, 25% Cabernet Franc, 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Petit Verdot greets the nose with purple fruits, cigar box and menthol. The soft palate is saturated with blackberry pie and peppery spice, presented with nicely chalky tannins.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is an easygoing but richly flavored wine that starts with light toast and spice aromas preceding somewhat sweet jammy flavors, a soft texture and medium body. Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon formed the blend.",US-California-Red Blend
"Lifted hints of chamomile and apple peel rise straight from the glass. The palate has the same streamlined citrus focus and just homes in on that sleek dry apple freshness that seem to be a dynamic force at the center of this wine. The flavors are concentrated and totally dominated by utter lemon freshness, tart and vivid to the last. Lovely now but with further potential. Drink now through 2030.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"This wine comes from a selection of parcels on the plateau above the Lot river in Cahors. It's rich and firm, with great wood and spice notes as well as exuberant black plum and berry fruit. With its acidity, still-young tannins and firm texture, it will age. Drink from 2020.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"The Tuenge (tongue-GEE) Vineyard was originally Chehalem Mountain Vineyard, first planted almost 40 years ago. A complex nose of spiced plums and cherries opens into a fruit-laden midpalate, adding blackberries and a thin vein of citrus. Firmly tannic, this precise, sculpted effort brings a refined structure, with just a whiff of volatility.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This is an ideal summer white. It's light but crisp on the bouquet, with whispy pear, apple and citrus aromas. Freshness reigns on the palate despite there being pulpy citrus flavors. Another wave of citrus carries the clear finish to a precise ending. Delicious white wine.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Fat in mouthfeel, waxy and earthy in aroma and packed with apricot and almond flavors, this layered and concentrated wine emphasizes savory notes rather than fruity ones and lushness in texture rather than crispness. Dried meats like prosciutto and salami could make great pairings.",US-California-White Blend
"Mossy, spicy blackberry aromas are more encouraging than what comes after. This is rubbery and astringent, with blackened flavors of licorice and toasted oak.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Pinot Noir offers plenty of varietal pleasure. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with cherry skin, red currant and cola flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Slightly grassy raspberry and plum aromas suggest oyster shell. This is drawing and a bit abrasive, with lightly herbal and generic red-fruit flavors. It's dry in feel and lightly bitter in flavor on the finish.",Spain-Levante-Monastrell
"Full-bodied and heavy in the Loring style, an extracted wine filled with exciting fruit and berry flavors, but lacking the delicacy and finesse you expect from Pinot Noir.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"All tangy fruit, this simple wine is light, with citrus and crisp pear flavors. A touch of honey adds a soft side while keeping its zesty fruit right in place. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Fresh boysenberry aromas are lifted by dried dill, black pepper and black olive on the spice-driven nose of this bottling. Tangy plum and underrripe berry flavors pop on the tense palate, where anise, oregano and marjoram round out the experience.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of broad white fruits provide the backdrop for the sweaty and cheesy overtones. It's medium bodied, with diffuse flavors, but the acidity keeps the palate bright and lifted. It finishes on a soft, soapy note.",US-Virginia-Chardonnay
"A soft touch of lemon and green pear creates an appetizing nose. The palate has a salty tang on its smooth, balanced and fruity body. Easy and light, this is perfect as a refreshing, versatile white.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"This has mocha, game and black-skinned berry aromas. The dense palate evokes cured meat, espresso and prune, framed by grainy, mouth puckering tannins. Drink through 2021.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This opens with aromas that recall white flower, orchard fruit and a light medicinal note. The lean, rather diluted palate offers apple skin, mineral and a hint of bitter almond alongside brisk acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Friulano
"This wine is young, surprisingly fruity at this stage for this normally textured, structured Grand Cru. A pure line of sliced apple and green-plum flavors are shot through with tangy acidity. The fruitiness and intense acidity will pass soon and the wine will develop the proper steely, tight and mineral character. It will drink at its best from 2020.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Sweeter and more medicinal than Morandé's basic Pionero Cab, but more or less on the same quality level. The mouthfeel is solid with slightly rough tannins, while the flavor profile revolves around medicinal cherry and cassis. Finishes similarly.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aloe vera balminess is promised on the zesty, aromatic nose. The palate fulfills this easily: this is supple and flowing, concentrated and fluid. White pepper, grapefruit zest, juicy pear and greenish leafiness all gather around the central seam of freshness. Elegance, poise and total refreshment is the result.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"Fresh aromas of honeysuckle lead to a palate where honey and vanilla come together atop ripe peach. Medium bodied, the texture is unctuous before finishing lean and light.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"A late release for this vintage, it remains tannic and earthy, with muted fruit. Some pretty tobacco scents add interest, though the rather high alcohol still burns on the finish. Drink up.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"This is direct and a bit hot in alcohol, with jammy berry, cherry, currant and oak flavors. It offers good Cabernet pleasure in an everyday sort of way.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Very dry and rather sharp in acidity, this Syrah offers cherry-berry flavors with a hint of herbs and spices. It turns bitter on the finish. Good price, but could use greater richness.",US-California-Syrah
The nose is very restrained: barely an aroma escapes. The palate comes in with shy reticent freshness but reveals a serious vein of grapefruit zestiness underneath. This has ample freshness that needs to be teased out. The finish is dry and clean.,France-Alsace-Riesling
Flavors of apple are spoiled by notes of mud and pondwater on the nose. The palate is bitter and undefined.,France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"Normally the Maipo Valley produces warm, dull Sauvignon Blancs. But this one has more kick and purity of fruit than most. The nose delivers tropical and melon aromas, while the palate is packed with lime, citrus and grapefruit flavors. It's on the big side and a little clingy on the finish, but mostly it gets things right.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Thin to the point of watery, with very modest citrus flavors but mostly herbs and dried hay. Clean enough, but there's nothing going on.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The weak nose offers a bit of sour cherry, raspberry and menthol, but just barely. On the palate, there are rounded red fruit flavors and a light earthiness, but again just faint. That said, it does pair nicely with meatloaf or, assuredly, the Hitching Post restaurant's grilled artichoke.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Red berry, toast and black spice aromas lead the nose, accented by whiffs of espresso. The palate offers licorice, clove, dried cherry and vanilla notes, while a backbone of fine-grained tannins provides support.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese

"Light and earthy, this wine's secret weapon is its sizzling tease of white pepper that explodes quietly on the palate as it develops. Further spiced in forest and pine, it dances along an elegant focus of integrated power and tannin to reveal elements of cranberry, pomegranate and wild strawberry.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Reedy green-leaning aromas of plum and raspberry feed into a creamy palate. This tastes primarily of herbal red-berry fruits that finish oaky, dry and spicy.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A touch of flinty reduction still hangs over the nose, subduing the varietal aromas. But this is only a sign of youth, as is the residual carbon dioxide on the palate. While very young, this holds all it needs for a promising future: A bright core of juicy fruit—think tangerine, tart red apple and ripe yellow pear—as well as the vividly clean and racy freshness of bright lemon. This is concentrated and rather powerful, rapier-like in its cleansing, dry finish but also generous on its fruity midpalate. This is confident and self-assured and stands tall with its powerful structure and body. Leave this to calm down and become itself. Drink 2018–2037.",France-Alsace-Riesling
Zippy acidity drives this dry medium-bodied Riesling. Its fresh green-apple and lime flavors are delicate in concentration but refreshingly crisp. Drink now through 2020.,US-New York-Riesling

"There's a reason why Syrah is on a roll in America, and it's wines like this that make the case. Soft and juicy, it's a mellow, sensual wine, with a taffeta mouthfeel that carries rich flavors of cherry-pie filling, red licorice and vanilla oak that are delicious and worthy of a second glass.",US-California-Syrah

"This is a rich jammy wine. Great black fruits and dark tannins are mixed with touches of chocolate and bitter coffee. It is dense, although with the acidity of the year it has a crispness that contrasts with the richness. Drink this ripe wine from 2026.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Smooth, sweet and savory, this Cabernet has forward flavors of blackberries, black currants, cola and sweet oak. It's an easy wine to drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sourced entirely from the Winter's Hill vineyard, this is a lively mix of raspberry, lime, pineapple and cherry candy. Young and tart, it needs more time to flesh out and show more detail. Currently the baking spice accents from aging in one-third new oak, appealing as they are, stick out a bit. Give this until 2016 or so to bottle age.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
Good fruit concentration and mellow oak accents make a good combo in this full-bodied and plush-textured wine. The aromas resemble cedar and tobacco and flavors suggest ripe plum and raspberry.,US-California-Merlot
"On the nose, aromas of potpourri, herb and maple syrup join a feral note of game. The mouthfeel has a consistency similar to crème de cassis, showing bold flavors but very little structural resistance. The short- to medium-length finish ends with touches of tobacco and autumn leaf.",US-Virginia-Merlot
The touches of wood aging are apparent in the almond and toasty edge to this perfumed wine. Quince and apricot fruit show strongly through the tight dry texture and minerality. It's a wine made to be drunk young with great fruit. Drink now.,France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"Yes, it's gigantic in alcohol. But it's dry, creamy-smooth and softly delicious, with palate-caressing flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants, mocha, cinnamon and pepper. Very nice by itself and will lift up short ribs or BBQ.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Lemon and creamed pear flavors give this open, soft wine attractive fruitiness. The fruit is everything here, with acidity adding a crisp edge to the rounder textures. It is ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This ripe Grenache is full-bodied and fruit-driven, but seems to have the stuffing to last at least 3–4 years. Cherry-berry flavors are punched up by herb and spice shadings that linger on the finish.",Australia-South Australia-Grenache
"Earthy, tart cherry and strawberry paint a pretty picture in this aromatic, inviting wine, a bold, fruity offering accented by luscious streaks of herb. Well-integrated and composed, dustings of cocoa and cola spice build steam on the finish, the overall package just lightly oaked.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Juicy sweet is an apt moniker for this fruity, forward Riesling. The grapey, sugary palate is a bit confected in style, but easy and approachable.",US-New York-Riesling
"Honey, butter, yellow pear, pineapple and vanilla cream show on the supple and soft palate of this bottling—one of the new appellation blends branded under the Nielson name.

"A gigantic Pinot Noir, rich and heady in black cherries, sweet licorice, bacon, mocha and toasty oak flavors, wrapped into firm tannins and brightened with crisp Santa Lucia acidity. It's a dramatic wine, but too young. Give it at least four years for all the parts to begin to come together.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A sweet note of vanilla and cinnamon emerges at first and is soon followed by cherry, coffee and leather. The wine is both soft and silky thanks to its cherry and bright fruit nuances. It also offers zesty freshness on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Dried cherry and raspberry aromas lead to medium-bodied, sweet fruit flavors that seem bit clipped. It doesn't all come together.",US-Washington-Red Blend

Silky on the palate, it shows a refinement of character and robust grasp of dark spicy notes that betray a baked, brooding quality of balanced richness. On the finish is a refreshing seasoning of orange zest.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A superior Syrah for its dryness, firm texture and restrained yet powerful flavors. Feels really fine in the mouth, with complex, rolling tannins that support waves of blackberry, bacon and sandalwood flavors, as well as something floral—violets, perhaps. Distinguished all the way through, it's fine for drinking now with foods like duck, game, steak or roasted chicken.",US-California-Syrah
"Elegant, austere, ethereal and tight in its aromatic delivery, this classic Barolo offers pristine berry tones backed by power and determination. Nebbiolo from Serralunga d'Alba tends to be more structured, dark and intense overall.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A soft but spicy nose starts this flavorful sip from Thorntree. Open, fresh and friendly on the palate, the wine has a simple but elegant character. Pair with poultry, grilled seafood or enjoy every day on its own.",South Africa-Western Cape-Chardonnay
"With so much intensity, botrytis and concentration, this is going to be impressive. It is still very young, at a closed stage, but the ripe currant as well as the honey dominate. Great wine.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"Too sweet, with a sugary, dessert wine taste to the briary berries. Otherwise, it's a clean Zinfandel, with good acidity and tannins.",US-California-Zinfandel
"There's a unique nose on this single-vineyard bottling by Joshua Klapper, with black olives, dried figs, cranberries and wood ash combining into a delicate almond-brittle sensation. The palate is subtle and restrained, all about finessed energy and nuanced texture, opening up into strawberries and cracked black pepper. Great right now but will live through 2025-plus.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a soft, simple and fruity wine. Round and gently boosted by the final acidity, it tastes of pear.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"There is a mere hint of fresh grapefruit on the nose but the palate follows with rounded, fresh but spice-edged mirabelle plums and more gentle citrus. There also are glimpses of fragrant citrus foliage with white pepper breaking through. This is ripe but light, rounded but delicate. A wonderfully zesty lemony finish just lasts and lasts.",Austria-Traisental-Grüner Veltliner
"Balanced acidity and fruit give this Lobre wine its immediate attraction. It has a bright character, the fruit and the acidity in harmony. Drink this ripe wine now.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"Hugh Hamilton's top-of-the-line wine is the Jekyll & Hyde Shiraz-Viognier. In 2007, it's a full-bodied, richly textured wine filled with raspberry, cherry and chocolate aromas and flavors. Based on its somewhat chewy finish, it should last and evolve through at least 2020.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz-Viognier
"This is oaky and resiny on the nose, but not overly so, with pear and apple aromas as well as a streak of saline. On the palate, this offers a good mix of oak resin, fruit pulp and acidity. Flavors of oak spice, white pepper, peach and apple finish fresh but with an oaky aftertaste.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"The wine is firm and still structured. With wood, dense tannins and just the hint of juicy black-currant fruit, it needs time. From 2019, it should be a richer fruitier wine, always with a tannic core.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
This earthy wine presents barnyard flavors over the riper red fruit and licorice flavors. Drink now when the fruit is at its best.,France-Loire Valley-Pinot Noir
"Gushing with bright strawberry and raspberry aromas and flavors, this wine tastes fresh and delicious, lively and fun. It's dry, well balanced, moderately tannic, and has an appetizing, grippy texture.",US-California-Red Blend
"Sourced from Les Collines vineyard, one of Walla Walla's best, this 100% Syrah opens with characteristic scents of smoke and bacon and black cherry. But in the mouth it has a syrupy flavor, somewhat medicinal, and dense tannins.",US-Washington-Syrah
"It's big and brawny, with a very deep color, strong oak aromas, assertive, astringent tannins, ripe blackberry and raspberry vinegar flavors and a spicy, eucalyptus note on the finish.",US-California-Merlot
"Longoria brings a deft touch to this Pinot Grigio. The grapes were briefly fermented in tank, then bottled when the wine was only about four months old. The result is exceptionally fresh and lively, with tangy acidity brightening citrus, lemongrass, vanilla and white pepper flavors.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"This creative blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 15% Tannat, 13% Petit Verdot, 8% Syrah and 1% Petite Sirah offers roasted red-bell pepper, black gravel, black plums, chocolate cake and caramelized beef on the umami-driven nose. The palate is tighter, with elderberries, cranberries and decent tannic grip, proving tasty but not quite as exciting as the nose suggests.",US-California-Claret
"There's a reason few wineries nowadays produce Barbera. It's a boring wine, and just because it comes from as fine a producer as Reverie can't change that fact. The wine is dry, tannic and dull, with unevenly ripened flavors.",US-California-Barbera
"This wine feels full and heavy on the palate. It's sweet and fruity, with an edge of grapefruit zest.",US-California-Moscato
"Very ripe and forward in candied black cherries, violets, cedar and mocha, with plenty of sweet toasty oak. Feels a bit chunky in the mouth. Drink now.",US-California-Merlot
"This wine has a zesty, effervescent aspect that provides a sense of refreshment, built around subdued oak and ripe lemon and lime. Medium in weight and dry, it finishes with a flair of salty brine, like an olive martini.",US-California-Fumé Blanc
"Aromas suggesting yellow stone fruit and acacia flower drift out of the glass. On the creamy palate, delicate hints of beeswax and almond underscore ripe apricot, apple and candied nectarine. Bright acidity lifts the rich flavors.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Made with Sangiovese and Canaiolo, this friendly wine opens with aromas of mature black plum and crushed blue flower. The one-dimensional and forward palate offers black raspberry accented with notes of clove and a hint of white pepper. Pair it with medium-seasoned cheeses or dense Tuscan bean soup.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"The Eyrie reserve is a single vineyard selection from the estate's oldest vines, planted between 1967 and 1973. The longevity of these wines is a proven fact; they evolve (and generally improve) for decades. This is already delicious, smoky, almost ethereal, with truly Burgundian finesse and depth. This wine, as much or more than any other, expresses the potential of Oregon Pinot Noir to approach the majesty of fine Burgundy.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"From one of Franciacorta's leading producers, Gran Cuvée Pas Operé offers an enticing fragrance of acacia flower, white flowers and beeswax. The creamy palate delivers apple, nut, spice, thyme and sage along with fine, persistent effervescence.",Italy-Lombardy-Sparkling Blend
"Grove Mill's 2009 Sauvignon Blanc strikes a pleasant balance between zesty citrus and ripe stone fruit. It's medium-bodied and plump in the mouth, with a crisp, clean finish that invites another sip.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Enticing scents of red berry, baking spice, Mediterranean scrub and a hint of eucalyptus slowly emerge. The elegantly structured palate delivers black cherry, licorice, clove and espresso framed in youthfully austere but refined tannins. It's still young and tightly wound but balanced, with bright acidity. Drink 2020–2028.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"While dry and delicate in body, this intense, penetrating Riesling is lush with sun-drenched peaches. A steely, mineral tone lends gravitas to the midpalate, finishing lean, elegant and bright. Enjoy now for its exuberant youth, but store some away to enjoy as its minerality intensifies from 2020 on.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"This combines Chardonnay, Malvasia Bianca, Sauvignon Blanc and Chenin Blanc in nearly equal parts. A sweet, floral nose of honeysuckle dominates before apricot jam and vanilla flavors enter the scene. Thick and concentrated, it finishes with a dry, crisp lemon note.",US-California-White Blend
"A soft and fruity style of rosé from a small Aube producer, this is ripe with red berry fruit and bright with acidity and orange zest tang. Dominated by Chardonnay, its color coming from still Pinot Noir wine, it's ready to drink now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Soft and ripe green pears play on nose and palate where that textural, phenolic mouthfeel is the main feature, suggesting that this belongs firmly on the table.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
Subdued aromas of black cherry and Asian spice lead the nose while the straightforward palate offers up juicy plum and a hint of cocoa. Round tannins provide the easygoing framework.,Italy-Northeastern Italy-Lagrein
"Two Hands' 2007 Gnarly Dudes is a nicely balanced wine, managing to be full bodied and supple in tannins while still coming in under 15% alcohol. Brown sugar and cinnamon shadings accent the main plum and earth elements, all wrapped up in a long, spicy finish. Drink now-2017.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"This is a medium-bodied, crisp and tangy wine with fresh parsley aromas and lemon and Granny Smith apple flavors. It's well balanced, restrained and will be very versatile with food.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Big, and powerful, this has generous flavors of yellow fruit, pear and integrated spice. It has weight to go with its more fruity character. With wood influence, refreshing acidity and a suggestion of tannin, it will age over the next 2–3 years.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"The wine tastes and feels important. It has great weight and depth. The tannins are extraordinarily thick, but ripe and smoothly sweet. And then there's the fruit, a detonation of blackberries, cherries, blueberries and cassis, not to mention the oak, which seems as fine as oak gets. This superb wine seems like an obvious cellar candidate. It should ride out the decade effortlessly.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This simple blend of 50% Sangiovese, 30% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon opens with aromas of dried black cherry, vanilla and a whiff of coconut. The round, soft palate shows mature black fruit and coffee alongside ripe tannins. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Aromas of ripe yellow fruits announce a wine that has rich fruit flavors of apricots touched by pineapple. It does have the attractive, nervy texture of 2008, along with an important layer of toast.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A beautiful Cab, ripe and lush, that defines the modern style of Oakville. With soft but complex tannins, its flavors are classic Cab, showing cassis and licorice, with a gorgeous overlay of smoky oak. Right up there with the best of them, the grapes were grown from a single vineyard at the Vine Hill Ranch.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"From a grape that's rarely planted in the Central Coast, this bottling shows loads of earthy aromas, from wet soil to crushed gravel, as well as tight blackberry, dried dill and white pepper notes. There's a touch of ripeness to the palate, with tobacco-laced red cherry and blueberry fruit, gravelly minerality and a firm, tannic structure.",US-California-Dolcetto
"Fragrant and refreshing, this savory white opens with delicate scents of white spring flower, orchard fruit and a whisper of crushed herb. The tangy palate delivers white peach, yellow pear and a hint of nectarine that linger on the crisp finish.",Italy-Lombardy-Turbiana
"Based on Petit Verdot, with the other four Bordeaux varieties blended in, this is ripe and rich in blackberries, mocha and oak. It distinguishes itself from Napa Valley—which is the unavoidable comparison—with a pleasurable earthiness and tartness, reflecting the Santa Ynez's cool climate.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"In the increasingly important Dão region, Sobral's top-of-the-range is an impressively rich dense wine. With its great tannins and generous black fruits, it is full of potential. Produced by winemaker Carlos Lucas from a selection of grapes as well as parcels, the wine is concentrated, dark and firm. The acidity gives it great life as well as a juicy character that emphasizes the ripe fruit. The wine is still young, drink from 2019.",Portugal-Dão-Portuguese Red
"A common, country-style wine, rich in cherries, cola and spices, with lusty tannins. It's lush and simple, but will rise to the occasion with a cheeseburger. The blend is Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Graciano.",US-California-Red Blend
"A lean but crisp mouthfeel characterizes this vintage-dated Prosecco Superiore. The wine shows simple tones of white flower, crushed stone and white almond. The effervescence feels tight and clean.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"This is an attractive wine that is given a perfumed lift by the inclusion of Malvasia Fina in the blend. It is fresh and young, emphasizing the crisp character and chalky texture typical of the Douro whites. The wine is cool, fruity and will be better enjoyed from summer of 2016.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"A very beautiful wine that shows the exotic, feral quality of the greatest Pinot Noirs from the Fort Ross area. It's explosive in wild raspberry and cherry flavors, with hints of pine, cola, wintergreen, anise, bacon and smoky, sweet vanillins from oak barrels. A wine of great pedigree, it's showing well now, and should hold for the next six years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Lovely and pure notes of Conference pear hover above a concentrated taut body. This is dry and has a pleasantly bitter pithy edge that seems to draw out the precision of the fruit even more. The palate is streamlined, taut and energetic and the finish is long and impressive with a final flourish of pear and citrus.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"Aromas of beeswax, honeysuckle and broom lead the nose on this juicy white. The concentrated palate offers white peach, apricot and nectarine zest alongside bright acidity.",Italy-Tuscany-Vermentino
"Like most 2012 Marlborough Pinots, this is crisp, with pie cherry fruit leading the way. Hints of campfire and button mushrooms add welcome complexity, ending on a long, mouthwatering note of tart fruit.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"Wiry and volatile aromas of vinegar and saucy berry fruits fail to impress. This Monastrell-Tempranillo blend is hard and tannic, with murky berry flavors that are also a bit weedy. Heat and a lack of ripeness mar the finish.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"With 4% Merlot, this Cab is aged just over two years in French oak and given almost as long in bottle before release. The result is satisfying, a swirl of savory black pepper, espresso, black cherry and tar smoothed out by dry tannins and restrained, toasty oak. The artist featured is Sonoma-based painter Keith Wicks.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of wisteria, young Bartlett pear and citrus lead the nose on this quenching sparkler. The racy, elegant palate offers grapefruit, green apple and lime alongside tangy acidity and an energized perlage. An almond note closes the finish.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"This opens with aromas suggesting weedy forest floor, stewed prune, leather and grilled porcini mushroom. The palate is on the raw side, offering tart sour cherry and a hint of dark cooking spice alongside raspy, grainy tannins that dry out the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"With 7% residual sugar and 11% alcohol, this is a Riesling to enjoy with spicy noodle dishes. Sweetness notwithstanding, it's a substantial wine with grip and definition. Melon and peach flavors roll smoothly into notes of caramel and honey. This is rich and delicious.",US-Washington-Riesling
"This is sourced from several Milbrandt vineyards, and a blend of both barrel (one third) and tank (two thirds) fermented grapes. It's soft and creamy, with melon, green banana and other light tropical fruits. A pleasant, easy-drinking quaffer, it finishes with a lick of vanilla custard.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"This fruity wine is full of bright acidity. Crisp and clean, it shows yellow fruits and a shot of citrus. The aftertaste is lively and bright. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Dark pink in the glass, this bubbly is incredibly foamy throughout the experience. It begins with aromas of strawberry, raspberry, plum and red apple, then explodes with bubbles on the palate, which make it hard to find the sour pomegranate and plum-skin flavors that eventually emerge.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Made with a blend of Mediterranean and Caucasian grape varieties, Jassarte shows a green note of medicinal herb with forest berry and bramble. The wine is tight, bright and nicely acidic on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"At first blush this reserve seems more oaky, more open and more overtly alcoholic than the just-released Leonetti 2008 Merlot and 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon. After many hours of breathing time it fills in with pretty plummy fruit, toast, caramel, whiffs of smoke, cedar and cigar box, and dry tannins.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"One of Chile's most honest producers of varietally correct Pinot is Kingston Family. This lovely, balanced example shows tea, red berry and floral aromas in front of a ripe, clean, racy palate. And finally a light dusting of chocolate and vanilla grace the finish. Ready to drink now.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir
"This is a delicious fruity wine, pink in color and with a swathe of crisp red-currant fruitiness. It is bright with acidity and forward fruit. Drink this attractive wine now.",France-Southwest France-Rosé
"Named after the stones in the vineyard, this tense, dense wine is still young. With steely acidity and a strongly mineral, chalky texture, it needs to age. Stone fruits, acidity and a strongly herbal character are just beginning to integrate. Drink from the end of 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Scents of brambly berry and forest floor mingle with accents of licorice, blackberry and mocha on the nose of this solid wine. It's medium in weight, with fine but slightly gripping tannins that yield a satiny structure around the ripe black-fruit flavors.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Red Blend
"Easy to like this softly appealing Merlot. It's a gentle wine, with a silky texture, and has candied flavors of cherries and raspberries. Pretty good price for a nice Napa Merlot.",US-California-Merlot
"Always aromatic, here the scents of jasmine and honeysuckle are prelude to a dry, yeasty, lightly honeyed wine with lime, orange and golden delicious apple fruit. The penetrating finish carries notes of beeswax and fruit leather.",US-Oregon-Gewürztraminer
"The balance between the firm tannins and ripe fruit works well here. The texture is dense, rough at the edges but with good layers of wood, acidity and dry tannins. The aftertaste has welcome freshness.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"An attractive pale pink wine that has bright red currant fruits, crisp acidity and a lively mousse. It is so fresh, fruity and deliciously crisp and refreshing. The aftertaste is light, bright and full of acidity.",France-Loire Valley-Sparkling Blend
"Here's a simple, correct Ripasso (made with partially air-dried grapes) that offers clean aromas of toasted almond, red berry and exotic spice. It's thin, short but smooth in the mouth so serve this red wine on informal occasions.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Tropical melon and mango notes are wild and effusive on the nose, striking a contrast to a palate that's surprisingly smoky and mineral. Vivacious and zesty on the palate, it's a uniquely composed, enjoyable wine.",US-New York-Riesling
"This is one of the more New Zealand-like Sauvignon Blancs out there, and that's a compliment. The wine is thoroughly dry and very crisp in acidity, with a grassy, lemony, minerally profile that makes it savory. Approximately one-fifth was barrel fermented, adding just the right touch of cream and smoke.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Cab specialist Surh Luchtel has had some years to figure out how to make their Page Nord Syrah, and judging by this '05 bottling, they're right on track. The wine is firmer in structure than the soft '04, but the flavors are no less startling. Blackberries, cherries, currants, chocolate and pepper flood the palate, wrapped into sumptuous tannins. Best now and for a few years.",US-California-Syrah
"Scents of black-skinned berry, violet and chopped herb unfold in the glass while the straightforward palate provides ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry and a suggestion of baking spice. Polished tannins uphold the juicy flavors",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"Grown on Antinori's original property, high on Atlas Peak, although you'd never know it from searching the front or back labels. It's a very fine wine, dry and elegantly constructed, with little of the baby fat over-the-topness that affects some Napa Cabs. Within that firm structure are extraordinarily complex blackberry, black currant and spicy plum flavors. Delicious now despite the firm tannins, and should develop over the next 8–10 years, at least.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"An unusual level of flavor concentration and density of texture make this wine substantive in mouthfeel, intriguing in depth, and a good wine to age for a few years. It has touches of sage and sweet oak in the aroma, plus full-bore flavors of blackberry and black cherry on the palate. With great structure due to firm tannins and acidity, it will be best to drink after 2019.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Cinnamon scents and a touch of reduction signal just how fresh this wine is. The ripeness of 2015 is well controlled here, its freshness preserved. Funkiness on the palate provides additional interest.",Austria-Burgenland-Zweigelt
"Aromas of candy corn, spice and almond butter are followed by full-bodied, tropical-fruit flavors that show a pleasing sense of richness and intensity. It's a delicious example of the variety, with a lingering finish.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Though not terribly complex or exciting, this is a well-made Minervois with soft red fruit and kirsch aromas backed by hints of spice and light floral characters. Approachable tannins and light acidity followed by a short, clean finish make this an easy-to-drink and enjoyable selection.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is mouthfilling but not overly weighty, with a wonderful blend of herbs and spices rounded out by cherries and plums. Intense garrigue notes pick up hints of anise on the long, softly dusty finish. Drink now–2020.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Vines planted between 900 and 1,200 feet above sea level give this cool interpretation of Pinot Noir. The wine is crisp, lightly structured with some tannins and with a delicate cherry and red-berry fruitiness. It will be ready to drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"With rich cherry fruits and a firmer underlying structure, this is a dense wine. It is still fresh and fruity but has also developed a broad, generous feel that gives weight. It is ready to drink.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Owned by art collector Philippe Raoux, who has filled the park of the chateau with impressive sculptures, this estate produces serious and complex wines. This latest release continues in that tradition. It is rich, structured and full of swathes of black fruit. The wine will take time, so wait until 2021.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Dry and sappy, this potent effort is heavily influenced by botanical flavors, to the point of being almost grassy. Dry extract and lemon/lime acidity keep the riper fruit flavors in check, but with ample breathing time the wine fills in with highlights of fresh peaches.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Concentrated, perfumed with aromatic violets and red berries. The wine has a rich character, showing berry fruits and light tannins that offer a rounded style.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Spunky, lively cherry, plum and currant aromas come with a whiff of rubber and Band-Aid. This blend of Tempranillo, Carignan and Grenache is dainty, with mid-level intensity. Oaky, medicinal plum and raspberry flavors run lean and herbal on the finish, and overall this is a light-framed red that's mild in character.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"This wine is an exemplary expression of Touriga Nacional. It has structure, perfumes, rich black-fruit flavors and a serious tannic background. Concentrated and with fine intensity, it needs to age, so drink from 2017.",Portugal-Lisboa-Touriga Nacional
"This rosé is slightly confected on the nose, but boasts ample weight and richness on the palate, along with appealing notes of raspberry, white chocolate and citrus.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"A deft combination of spice, earth and dried fruit hits the nose on this bottling, with aromas of cinnamon, chalk, baked plum, mace and purple flowers. The mineral-driven palate offers lots of rocky flavors, with brick and chipped slate giving depth to wound-up cherry, red apple skin and turned-earth elements.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A little heavy and soft, with jelled raspberry, cola and vanilla flavors. The finish turns sugary.",US-California-Rosé
"Rich in apricot and orange marmalade, crème brûlée and vanilla flavors, this dessert sipper has a soft, honeyed richness. The residual sugar is 14.1%, making it fabulously sweet.",US-California-Gewürztraminer
"Delicate aromas suggest white spring flower and pear. On the linear palate, vibrant acidity balances tart apple and lemon-zest flavors. A light mineral note energizes the finish.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"Fragrances recall acacia, white spring flowers, honey, bread dough and beeswax. The concentrated palate delivers mature yellow apple, toasted walnut, clove, vanilla and pie crust alongside vivacious, persistent effervescence.",Italy-Lombardy-Sparkling Blend
"A bit cheesy and funky, with rhubarb and leather along with baked berry aromas. The palate feels fine, but the flavors are leathery and sort of salty, with touches of pepper and herbs as well. Not as ripe and appealing as what we're looking for from a Rioja reserva.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Toast, coffee, vanilla, dill and other wood spices are far out-front on the aromas. They vie for attention on the palate as well, never seeming to marry with the fruit while still providing enjoyment.",US-Washington-Tempranillo
"This wine ticks all the boxes, but just lacks the excitement and drama to take it to the next level. Smoke and vanilla notes add interest to the juicy, easy-to-drink cassis fruit. There's ample but not too much weight on the palate. Supple tannins. Perhaps it just needs additional cellaring time to warrant the price, although it doesn't come across as needing it in the structural sense.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"With a steady portfolio of above 90-point wines, you can count on Moccagatta for elegant, territory-driven expressions of Nebbiolo. Bric Balin Barbaresco is a beautiful wine with seamless integration of berry, smoke and spice flavors.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Named after the many lighthouses which guide sailors on the French Atlantic coast, this soft and fruity wine is made from 100% Merlot. Crisp, with plenty of red fruit, it's light and ready to drink.",France-France Other-Rosé
"Fresh and fruity, this simple red doles out wild cherry, crushed raspberry and strawberry alongside tang acidity and smooth tannins. This would match well with pizza or light pasta dishes. Drink now.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This opens with a strong sense of oak and sawdust, later giving way to herbal berry aromas. This feels plump and resiny, with slick oak. Flavors of wood resin and pepper are on equal footing with berry flavors, while the finish shows moderate residual heat.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Merlot
"Pretty and fresh, with vibrant, well-defined strawberry fruit on the nose set against a backdrop of white flowers. Turns a bit simple and fleeting in the mouth. Drink up.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Aged in 25% new French oak, the rest of it neutral, this age-worthy Chardonnay shows refreshing restraint, though it retains plenty of fruit. The aromas tend toward faint caramel and a complex web of acidity and brightness accompanies notes of apple and pear, a long finish capping things off.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A white wine made from a red grape, this barely hints at a tawny straw shade. The fruit tastes principally of golden apple and white peach, and it has a pleasing roundness in the mouth, with a light touch of saltine cracker.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Light aromas offer notes of apple and pear. The palate of thhis wine is cleanly made, showing no obvious new-oak impact. It's a straight-down-the-fairway interpretation of this variety.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Really fine for a low-acid vintage, there's an intriguing nose here with white pepper, sandalwood and pine-nut elements. There are mature notes to the apple, toast and pepper flavors, good backbone, and the texture is just lovely. This well-developed example still has youthful elements, and closes with a grapefruit-mineral finish that is both relaxed and complex.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This tastes sweet and hot, which gives the flavors of blackberry and raisin a Port-like character.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Slightly stalky, roasted aromas of earthy plum and berry lean in the direction of compost. This feels light and somewhat hollow, but easy. Stalky, oaky flavors of tree bark and rooty berry fruits carry onto the finish of this slightly herbal crianza.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Still tight and chewy, this lushly-fruited Syrah mixes berry and cherry flavors with earthier, mineral-driven bass notes. It will require a bit more bottle age to unwind and decompress, but it has all of the ingredients of a wine with staying power.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Attractive, soft, white-fruit wine, its pear flavors rounded and gentle. This is a perfect apéritif style, easy with light acidity to cut through the ripe fruit.",France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"While the wine has plenty of juicy fruit, it also has a heavy hand with wood that gives a bitter, spice and pepper character. Densely textured, it's tough for the moment although it will round out. Drink from 2017.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"A touch of caramelized sugar lingers from nose to finish on this brisk wine, melding into layers of white peach, caramel and cream. It's light in body, but the mouthfeel is surprisingly round and rich. The finish is zesty and bright.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"When Russian River Zinfandel succeeds, and this one does, it marries the variety's wild, feral personality to the valley's perfect terroir to produce distinctive wines. Ottimino's 2005 Von Weidlich is very tannic, but classic in presentation, showing blackberry, currant and intense black pepper aromas and flavors. Might tempt you to cellar it, but it's best over the next year for sheer exuberance.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This is a balanced, steely white, showing minimal oak and simple layers of apple, pear and vanilla.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Nice on the nose, this has a leafy note and a mellow red-berry aroma. Bouncy and rubbery feeling, it has easygoing flavors of raspberry and plum. It's candied and rubbery tasting on the finish, but good overall.",Spain-Levante-Tempranillo
"There's a hint of rusticity to the baked red berry aromas in this wine. Vanilla rooibos and brown sugar hover over a red-currant core. The palate is a bit flabby and jammy, with acidity struggling to snap everything into shape.",US-Virginia-Cabernet Franc
"This bracing, precisely crafted wine emphasizes crispness and attractively lean fruit flavors over richness, and it will be great with appetizers and seafood, even raw oysters. It's fresh, clean and inviting.",US-California-Viognier
"Crème caramel and spice aromas are exotically appealing on this bright, full-bodied Chardonnay. Dry in style with zesty acidity and fresh apple flavor, the palate is a bit more subtle than the nose, but makes this a straightforward drinker.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"This wine delivers pretty stone fruit and grapefruit notes, with a hint of honey and blossoms. The palate is light to medium bodied and offers plenty of acidity to balance. A slightly spicy, white pepper note marks the finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"This amped-up vintage of the Merlot-dominated, BFM Bordeaux-style red tops 15% alcohol, but seems a bit contrived. Aggressive vanilla and tobacco flavors cover up the nuanced highlights found in past BFM vintages, and the base of black cherry fruit carries a root beer finish. Not that it isn't a tasty drink—it is—it's just less interesting than before.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"We are big fans of Mauro Sebaste but found this vintage of his base Barolo to be slightly less charged and intense than previous years. You'll get characteristic aromas of wild fruit, cola and spice and the mouthfeel is drying, polished and long-lasting. Give this wine another five to 10 years of cellar aging.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

The supple, silky texture is notable. Best Buy. —S.H.",US-California-Red Blend
"Ultraripe black fruits—berries and cherries, along with raisins—reflect the high alcohol.

"A deeply golden Chardonnay from E & J Gallo's Edna Valley brand, this wine starts with a tightly wound nose, faintly offering tart apple, lemon rind and a slight herbal character. An elegant but brief flavor of perfumed pear washes away quickly without much finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"We need wines like this that are super-dry, ultra-crisp in acidity and sleakly lean. This one's the anti-Chardonnay.

"The H3 Cab comes across as a more tightly defined, sharp-edged version of the Merlot. Same berry flavors, a bit more acid, and a sense that the wine goes deeper into the palate, though with less breadth. It feels taut in the middle, as if needing more bottle age and/or breathing time to flesh out, but the structure is sound and the flavors clean and varietal.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Produced from old vines in Verdigny, this is rich while still totally crisp. Ripe yellow and white fruits, apricots and apples are cut with acidity and a taut, mineral character. While this wine is ready to drink, it will improve for some time, and will be better in 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Oveja Negra consistently produces a very good Cabernet with inky darkness and concentrated aromas of black fruits and toast.

"This is the top wine in the Wine & Soul range from Sandra Tavares da Silva and Jorge Serôdio Borges. It is a great wine in every sense, from its power and density to its grace and style. Allied with the black fruits, there are huge tannins and a dark, brooding character that promises long-term aging. Drink from 2020.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This big, spicy wine is dominated by licorice and heavy toast wood flavors. It is rich and full of black plum skins with only a hint of acidity. The aftertaste is sharp and bitter.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red

"Schramsberg did a good job with this wine, creating a lush sparkler with generous cascading bubbles, firm Pinot fruit and a tight, spicy finish. This is still hard and even a little bitter at the end; more time in the bottle will bring out all the richness locked inside.",US-California-Champagne Blend
"Peach skins, red apple and a touch of slate and iron show on the nose of this rose, which is light in the glass with a tan shade of pink. The flavors are quite light with red apple and nectarine skin, framed by a steely minerality.",US-California-Rosé

"This is the second wine of Château Balestard, and there are suggestions of high extraction and very ripe fruit. It does have balance, however, the black fruits need time to calm down. The acidity is all here, offering freshness to this rich wine.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Wood-aged and ripe, this is a full, generous blend of Alicante Bouschet, Touriga Franca and Touriga Nacional. Full of rounded black fruits and firm tannins, it needs further aging to bring out the full suppleness and richness. Drink from 2019.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red

"Primarily Merlot, with 18% Cabernet Sauvignon (from the Bacchus vineyard) filling out the blend. Lovely aromatics open into a high acid red with raspberries and plums.

"Extraordinarily rich and ripe, just explodes with cherry jam, crushed black raspberries and sweet toasted oak and vanilla flavors. But it's not a simple fruit bomb.

"Made by the top Muscadet producer Christophe Gadais, this is beautifully clean and crisp. It has fragrant fruit flavors of citrus and apple, with a light, dancing character.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"Toasty, buttery and laced with tropical fruit, this is a full-bodied, fully-oaked Chardonnay that manages to pull all that off with grace and aplomb, thanks to healthy acid levels and admirable concentration. Long on the finish; drink now through 2013.",New Zealand-Hawke's Bay-Chardonnay
"This Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc is very easy to drink, if slightly lacking distinctiveness. Melon and fig flavors finish on a slightly grassy note, while the texture is plump and soft.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"This at-first subtle wine shows more complexity with each sip. It has the aroma of toasted baguette slices, then tastes rich and figgy, with pear and almond nuances that linger on the finish due to a nicely viscous texture.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Floral and fresh, but there's more to it than just a simple quaff. Watermelon and berry flavors are carried by a plump, medium-bodied palate, slightly oily texture and a long, mouthwatering finish.",France-Provence-Rosé

Fresh aromas of Meyer lemon and graphite shavings get layered with oak-related scents of toasted coconut flake and ground vanilla. The palate surrounds a core of lemon-lime-laced apple and fleshy ripe pear, with guava skin on the finish. Very easy to drink.",US-California-Chardonnay

"The wine is rich and dense. It has plenty of black fruits although it does suffer from some bitter extraction notes. There is power here, with high toast flavors and a dark, spicy character. The final taste of pepper comes from the high alcohol percentage.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon hails from a three-acre block of the winery's estate. Muted somewhat in terms of fruit, it offers instead ample amounts of smoky oak and herb, the tannins firm and generous.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Cabernet Sauvignon is subtle and restrained on first sniff, but only takes a few swirls to unlock its expressive aromas of blackberry, cassis, brown spice and undergrowth. Medium to full bodied, the palate bears seamless acidity and refined tannins. The finish shows some warmth, but mocha notes linger, creating balance.",US-Virginia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Light and luminous in appearance, this bright Rosso di Montalcino delivers subdued aromas of raspberry, cherry, cola and wet earth. None of these aromas are particularly intense, but they are balanced.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Brisk acidity provides a bracing balance to the ripe pineapple, pear and peach jam flavors, and there's a nice streak of minerality. However, the wine is far too sweet, and is cloying in the sugary finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Villa Prandone Navicchio is a pretty expression of Pecorino from Central Italy with resiny aromas of mature apricot, cola and white peppercorn. There's depth and personality here and the wine offers a unique experience.",Italy-Central Italy-Pecorino
"The numbers represent the grapes within: 75% Merlot, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon and 2% Petit Verdot. High in acidity, it shows a crispness of red berry, its core juicy and easy to like. Integrated oak keeps things simple and round, with leather and tobacco poking their heads on the finish.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Cool, herbal blueberry aromas comes with notes of plastic and wet cement. Hard, blocky and tannic across the palate, this tastes of roasted berry fruits and minty oak. A chewy finish collapses under its own weight and tannins.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
Dark-skinned berry and baking spice aromas lead the nose. The easygoing palate offers juicy black cherry and mocha flavors with a touch of white pepper. Dusty tannins leave a drying finish. Drink through 2021.,Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A powerful, concentrated wine, it has great density and structure. It shows the quality of the vintage, rich and fruity while preserving the elegance and poise that is typical of Chryseia. The result of a partnership between the Symington family and Bruno Prats from Bordeaux, it has a smooth, ripe, black fruit character underpinned by firm tannins. It needs several years to age, so drink from 2017.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This elegant wine puts flavors of apple and citrus with floral highlights into the mix. It gains strength in midpalate, finishing strong with cinnamon, paprika and white pepper.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"This 75-25 blend of Chardonnay and Grillo (aged only in stainless steel) makes a great companion to fresh seafood dishes. The wine offers loads of citrus and pear notes, with a chalky mineral overtone and bright acidity.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"A very shy nose leads onto a fresh palate where frothy bubbles reveal a hint of tart red-currant fruit and fresh citrus. The body is very light and dry, but has a zesty, mouthwatering finish.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"Whispers of tobacco leaf and cherry cola on the nose combine with a palate full of ripe black cherries on Hazlitt's easygoing, everyday Cabernet Franc. Soft tannins accented by woody notes of bramble and dried herbs make for a smooth, earthy finish.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"This impressive Port was made with old vine grapes foot-trodden in open lagares. Opulent, dense and rich with sweet fruit balanced by dry tannins and considerable acidity, it's built to age seriously. Named after Antonia Adelaide Ferreira—a legendary Douro figure from the 19th century whose family still owns the estate—it will be ready to drink from 2028 at the earliest.",Portugal-Port-Port
"The vineyard is one of the youngest at the winery, and the flavors reflect that, with bright, fruity, forward raspberry notes. It's lightly spiked with sweet baking spices, and makes a perfectly delicious choice while waiting for some of the winery's bigger, bolder 2012s to age a bit further.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Lots of acidity gives this Chardonnay a real bite, while the fruit is very ripe, expressive of pineapples, tangerines and Meyer lemons. The result is a flavor of sour yellow candy, enriched with the creaminess of lees and a buttered toast note from the oak barrels. Drink with rich, buttery shellfish entrées.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Earthy and spicy, this is classic cool-climate, coastal Pinot, with a whole-cluster mentality and depth of complex flavor and texture. Tart pomegranate and cranberry combine for a light-hearted approach to the vintage, with herbal accents that reach far across the soulful finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The wine is ripe, still young with its fresh fruits and acidity. The elements are all there to produce a dark and dense wine that has fine structure. It's a complex blend of Alfrocheiro, Syrah and Touriga Nacional, all of which will allow the wine to age over a good few years. Drink this impressive wine from 2017.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
"92–94. Barrel sample. This concentrated wine is packed with new wood as well as dark chocolate flavors. The palate is dense with bitter, extracted coffee flavors, but balanced by lively, lingering acidity.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"A greeting of caramel and honey reveals a touch of barrel reduction in this medium-bodied, generously layered wine. It imparts a ripeness of melon and apple, finishing in a sprinkling of nutmeg.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Made in a big style, this keeps its balance from the aroma through the finish. It has a dark color for what can often be a lighter-colored wine. Aromas recall dark cherries and black pepper, while flavors resemble blackberries. The tannins are firm but the texture is satisfyingly broad and generous.",US-California-Grenache
"Like a fruit juice drink, with sugary pineapple, mango and orange flavors. The acidity is bright, but this Chardonnay is more like a dessert wine than a dry table wine.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Gritty roasted aromas of burnt meat and herbal black fruits set up a grabby palate that feels rough and tannic. Flavors of salty, herbal, roasted berry fruits are strained.",Chile-Maule Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Winemaker Jeff Fink is unleashing a cross-section of clones in 2012, and this take on Pommard offers delicious aromas of berry-laced crème brûlée with bay leaf. There is a bitterness at first on the tannic palate, and it washes out quickly with tart cranberries.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Dark, oaky and smoky for a value wine, this has leather and blackberry aromas. It feels full, chewy and substantive, with dark berry, molasses and mocha notes. Smooth and dense on the finish, with leftover blackberry, coffee and chocolate touches.",Spain-Central Spain-Tempranillo
"Roasted and rubbery on the nose, this has herb and leaf accents. It feels thick, chunky and a bit syrupy, with flavors of herb, mint and roasted blackberry. This turns grittier on the finish, with bacon, hickory and rubbery flavors. A blend of 50% Monastrell and 50% Syrah.",Spain-Levante-Monastrell-Syrah
"Toasted almond, wild berry, plump cherry and wild raspberry open the nose on this Sangiovese, which has the varietal's characteristic freshness as well.",Italy-Central Italy-Sangiovese

"A consistent standout for this winery, the new vintage does not disappoint. Jazzy and jammy red-fruit and spice aromas are followed by rich, plump, beautifully balanced fruit flavors followed by an extended finish. It only ramps up over time. It's a prototype of the variety and about as good as it gets from the state.",US-Washington-Zinfandel
"The wine shows the success of white wines in the 2014 vintage. Initially it has lively acidity and a crisp texture. Then the palate fills out with complex citrus, pineapple and apricot flavors. The aftertaste—juicy and tangy—is already delicious. Drink from 2021.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"From an organically farmed estate vineyard in Chiles Valley operated by the same family for more than 40 years, this 87% Cabernet Sauvignon-13% Merlot has soul and structure, as well a stony minerality that compels. Menthol and tobacco weave between thick layers of dark cherry and plum, complemented on the palate by exotic cardamom and clove. This is one worth cellaring through 2022 or giving an hour or two to open.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Quady North's Flagship is what the owners consider the best lot of wine of the year. Generously slathered in toasty new oak, this very limited (two barrel) reserve from the estate's Frank's Vineyard is not the blockbuster of the previous vintage, but shows exceptional winemaking skills. Black cherry fruit is wrapped in woody tannins, a yin-yang combination that works by dissonance rather than harmony.",US-Oregon-Syrah
"In an oxidative style, this is a wine that is smooth and full of ripe fruit tones. With black plum and berry flavors it has just enough of a tannic edge, with a soft aftertaste.",Portugal-Port-Port
"This late release is an unusual blend of Syrah, Baco Noir, Tempranillo and Dolcetto. All are strengths of the AVA, though rarely blended together. The extra bottle age has smoothed the rough edges, yielding a pleasant-drinking wine with flavors of strawberry preserves, citrus peel, and a touch of malt powder.",US-Oregon-Red Blend
"A blend of two clones (MV6 and 114), this is a floral wine that blends ripe cherries with more savory notes of mushroom and smoke. The oak is wonderfully understated, which allows the fruit complexity to shine and leaves the fruit tannins to glide easily across the palate. Drink now–2025.",Australia-Victoria-Pinot Noir
"The aromas pop, with notes of fresh blueberry pie, sweet herb, dark-roasted coffee and spice. The palate doesn't quite deliver on all those aromas, seeming a bit less bold than the nose suggests. Still, this wine is enjoyable, especially after it has time to open up.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This rounded, ripe SB makes the most of its peach and tropical fruit flavors. Green plums lend structure to this soft wine, but there's a full, crisp aftertaste. Screwcap.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Dark in color, with grassy aromas of sugar beet and raisin, this doesn't smell much like typical Pinot Noir. A heavy palate that pinches shows flavors of cherry and medicinal black plum, while a sweet finish tastes of prune.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir
"This wine has a bright, lively texture and tasty, ripe fruit flavors that don't overdo it. A sense of crispness and tanginess will make it versatile for food pairing.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Light in the mouth and silky, like a Pinot Noir, with cherry and raspberry fruit flavors. A little one-dimensional, but okay now with a nice cheeseburger.",US-California-Mourvèdre
"This wine doesn't fully come together, with a somewhat uncomfortable mixture of grapy aromas, wood and herbs. It's medium bodied with cherry flavors and grainy tannins, trailing toward the finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
The wine is all spice and sweet fruits. It has a honeyed character that gives the wine softness while also showing a dry core. The wine is rounded now and ready to drink.,France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Despite its lighter color, this wine explodes from the glass with a complex, near-endless list of aromas that include sea breeze, crushed flowers, peat, green olive, fire pit, smoked meat, pepper, orange peel and sea salt.

"From a vineyard named for the oceanic deposits found there, this bottling offers blackberry syrup, vanilla, clove and black tea aromas. Like the nose, the palate offers a minty lift to its boysenberry and blackberry fruit. It's framed by strong acidity and soft tannins that build after several sips.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"San Francisco-based winemaker Ed Kurtzman heads to this famed vineyard south of Salinas to create this restrained bottling from a region where power and richness usually reign. Flint, Meyer lemon, honeysuckle and grapefruit aromas show on the nose. The palate offers nectarine, white peach and Asian pear flavor, proving delicate but not shy.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Lots of rich, complex raspberry, cherry, red currant and spice flavors in this dry, silky wine. It's quite well made, although it is a little sharp. Could develop, but seems best opened by 2014.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Claudio Fenocchio's classically crafted Barolos are consistently outstanding even in tough vintages. His flagship Bussia delivers succulent black cherry, truffle, leather and balsamic sensations balanced by big but fine tannins. This is already developing some complexity. Imported by Masciarelli Wine Co, Moonlight Wine Co.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A helluva Cabernet. Extraordinarily rich and opulent in blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, with elaborate oak, yet completely dry, and given balance by firm, hard tannins and a fine cut of acidity. Really impressive now, after decanting, and should develop over the next six years, at the very least.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"At about four years of age, Talbott's '04 tastes overripe. It has the aromas and flavors of a botrytized, late-harvest Chardonnay, brimming with apricot jam and pineapples, except that it's bone dry. With the very high acidity, this makes it unbalanced and not entirely enjoyable. This is a bottling that seems to do better in cooler vintages.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Rich aromas of late summer are here: the ripe peel of yellow pears, luscious peach and yellow Mirabelle plum plus some dried hayflower notes. There is power and depth, along with some alcoholic heat and balancing acidity—beautiful now but it will get even better. Drink until 2020.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"This wine combines opulent, ripe, almost sweet fruit flavors with good, firm tannins in an appealing way. It tastes full-bodied, drenched with blackberries and finds a good balance that makes it appetizing.",US-California-Red Blend
"Vrucara represents a new, exciting page in the story of Sicily's most important indigenous grape, Nero d'Avola. The purity of the fruit comes through loud and clear, and the wine doesn't deliver that bittersweet finish you sometimes get. Instead, it shows cherry, spice and an elegant mineral tone.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"Fresh apple and lemon aromas and fruity but not showy flavors create a very tasty, crisp-textured and well-balanced wine. More nuances come out with each sip, like bits of apricot and lime, and the mouthfeel stays bright and nicely acidic through the finish. An unoaked wine, this includes 4% Viognier.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The style of Piper-Heidsieck's nonvintage Champagne is getting more and more refined. It is drier than in the past while also full of ripe white fruits. There is a tight structure, a hint of toast from bottle age and fresh acidity at the end. Ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"With 12 months in wood, this is a firm wine, with a rustic, funky character that masks the black-currant fruit. The smoky wood contrasts with the acidity while leaving a dry aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Plum, slate and cherry blossoms show on the nose of this wine, grown along the Foxen Canyon corridor. Red fruit and hibiscus highlight the top of the sip, followed by brick minerality, bright acidity and a spice that leans toward anise.",US-California-Sangiovese
"The nose recalls a host of very fresh things: green ferns, wet pebbles and zesty lime peel. The palate adds generous yellow plum fruit and convinces with a spicy, fruity core and quite a bit of alcoholic warmth. Extended, savory length.",Austria-Weinviertel-Grüner Veltliner
"With an over-oaked taste and sugary flavors of peach, pineapple and apricot jam, this Chard is more like a dessert wine.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Leathery, dried cherry fruit flavors are set against streaks of earth, herb and a hint of barnyard. It's soft and eminently accessible, the tannins smooth and supple, with a hint of vanilla.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A light and pristine blend of Verdicchio and Vermentino from Umbria in central Italy, this beautiful wine offers sharp, focused citrus, white flower and stone fruit flavors.",Italy-Central Italy-White Blend
"There is fine acidity here as well as the extra richness from wood aging. The wine has weight, spice and fresh apricot and quince flavors. It is a wine for aging for a couple of years, so drink from 2015.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Produced from old vines in a quinta in the high eastern end of the Douro, in Douro Superior, this wine is aged for 15 months in wood. That has broadened the tannins and given the wine its rich, opulent black fruit character. After four years, it is still young, and should not be touched until 2018.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This luminous, golden Pinot Grigio offers loads of intensity in the form of peach, apricot, honeydew melon and white almond. The mouthfeel is smooth and thick, making this wine particularly well suited to sophisticated pasta dishes such as pumpkin-filled ravioli with crushed walnuts.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"You'd never confuse this with a California Chard. Well, Anderson Valley, maybe. It's a cool-climate wine. Aromas of fresh, cold green apples, with what seems like an overlay of buttery oak. Brilliantly dry and crisp in the mouth. It's all about acidity here; flavors are secondary. Clean as a whistle, edgy, a nervously racy wine that practically cries out for shellfish.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
Imported by Kobrand.,New Zealand-Hawke's Bay-Chardonnay
"From vineyards that surround the winery in San Martin, this wine offers stony aromas of black slate and earth but only the tiniest bit of plum fruit. Dark red-cherry fruits show on the palate along with cedar, and it's rather light in body though with grippy tannins.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"What this 100% Merlot lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in the sheer power of its fruit. It's rich and spicy in black cherry, milk chocolate, red licorice and oak, after being aged for 20 months in 100% new French barrels. With thick but refined tannins, it's drinkable now.",US-California-Merlot
"Sparkling Shiraz is an acquired taste, but this is a good introduction to the genre. Simply put, it's a big, oaky Shiraz with bubbles, bursting with vanilla, blackberry, chocolate and cedar aromas and flavors. Enjoy it over the next few years for its youthful exuberance.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"A blend of 50% Grenache and 50% Cinsault from the 50-year-old Pointe de Diable vineyard, this is a soft and ripe wine. It has light acidity and rich red-berry fruits. It's a wine for apéritif drinking—gentle and fruity at the end (the road to the property is called “End of the World”). Drink now.",France-Provence-Rosé
"An arresting blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (62%), Merlot (27%) and Cabernet Franc, it displays purity with its herb, bay leaf, earth and cherry flavors. The exquisite balance is where this wine really shines, winning over on its elegance, detail and length rather than power. It shows first-class fruit and exceptional winemaking.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Although Chardonnay might not traditionally be Justin's strong suit, this is a ripe and creamy wine, with notes of tropical fruit, citrus and oak throughout.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a big Pinot Noir, with an explosive intensity of cherries and raspberries that is ripe and pure. Oak, of course, is there too, in the form of buttered, smoky toast. However, the wine isn't a mere fruit bomb. It has interesting nuances of earthy things, like mushrooms, nettles and Provençal herbs. The silky texture is an exquisite balance of acids and tannins. This new brand from Hall winery is made by their talented winemaker, Steve Leveque, and it immediately enters the California pantheon of excellent Pinot Noirs.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This rich and creamy vintage wine boasts soft apples, fresh acidity and a fine, tight texture. There's just a hint of toast to round out the palate and add complexity. It could improve with age further, so drink through 2020.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"There's a pretty mineral context here that frames a juicy core of honey, almond and peach. This oak-aged Chardonnay is simple but genuine and would make a good companion to endive salad with blood oranges and black olives.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Chardonnay
"With light vanilla aromas, this is a ripe style of wine despite its low alcohol. An attractive creamy texture gives it a round character, fresh with yellow fruits and orange peel. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"Bright and perky with acidity, along with a delicate, silky mouthfeel, this is a pretty Pinot for drinking now with steak or char-broiled salmon. It has delicious flavors of cherries and pomegranates, along with earthier notes of ripe heirloom tomatoes and sautéed wild mushrooms splashed with Balsamic.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Distinctive scents of chocolate, nougat and lemon cake swirl up from the glass, framing a dive into a tangy wine loaded with red fruits. There's a suggestion of cola, great texture, excellent length, and above all an approachable, yet ageworthy, structure.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Soft aromas of sea shell, stone and mango appear in the bouquet. In the mouth, this is big and clumsy, with cidery flavors that continue onto the finish. Like many 2012 Chilean Chardonnays, this is overly ripe and not in the best balance.",Chile-Curicó Valley-Chardonnay
"This is an upscale Cabernet, rich in black currants, mocha and oak, and framed in sturdy tannins. Shows lots of class despite the statewide California appellation.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a delicious Chardonay. It dances in pear, peach and lemon notes. Balanced and addictive, it's easy to love and not overly complicated at all. Encased in just enough oak to provide texture and weight, this is a great wine for parties or casual dinners, pairable with just about anything.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This generous rosé was whole-cluster pressed, yielding bright, fresh flavors of just-picked strawberries. The flavors are uplifted with a backing of wet stone minerality, and if any wine captures springtime in a bottle, this is it.",US-Oregon-Rosé
"Sage, brush and pencil shavings make for a savory, gravelly experience on the nose and palate of this full-bodied, high-elevation wine. Robustly tannic, it softens in the glass and on the finish in a stream of black pepper and dried herb.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Crede is a top-notch Prosecco Brut (with 10% Pinot Bianco and 5% Verdiso added to the blend for extra structure and crispness respectively) that offers generous fresh fruit tones followed by almond blossom, macadamia nut and Golden Delicious apple. The mouthfeel is streamlined and crisp with a creamy, frothy finish.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"There's three words you need to know to understand this wine: vanilla, vanilla and vanilla. Sure, there are some hints of coffee, and just enough plummy, blackberry fruit to support the heavy-handed oak, but this is Shiraz of a distinct style. If you like lavishly oaked wines, this one is for you.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Forest floor, truffle, new leather, ripe berry and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find in this delicious red. The fresh, chewy palate doles out fleshy black cherry, chopped mint and white pepper notes, while big, round tannins provide structure. It's already enjoyable but will offer years of fine drinking. Enjoy 2018–2024.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Pear-scented, this supple white delivers straight down the line without any annoying frills. The wine is balanced, clean and comes with poised acidity.",Austria-Wagram-Donauland-Grüner Veltliner
"Let this burly, big-boned beauty open to fully enjoy its robust oak and fistfuls of black cherry, the oak showing in terms of toasty, slightly reductive aromas. A smooth texture keeps the wine flowing along a concentrated highway of power and ripeness.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This firm wine has black-currant and red-plum fruit, nicely integrated with the dry core. Ready to drink, although capable of aging a year or two.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"There aren't too many California Pinots lying around at $16. A Pinot made from organic grapes, this has a strawberry note in the foreground, followed by a peppery, spicy undertone. With its weight and depth on the finish, it'll hold up to a range of meals.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"One-third of the wine went through whole-cluster fermentation, giving an edge to a fresh herb and moist earth component. A streak of iron and a touch of licorice surrounds firm cherry fruit. It's a solid effort that fades a bit quickly.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Mesh is a partnership between famed Clare Valley Riesling producer Jeffrey Grosset and the Hill Smith family of Yalumba. The 2012 is a solid effort, relatively light in weight but concentrated in flavor, featuring potent notes of lemon and lime sherbet. Very tart and dry on the finish, it needs either oysters or plenty of time in the cellar.",Australia-South Australia-Riesling
"Not your usual dark and superripe California wine, this is light in color with a brick-brown edge. It smells lightly spicy, almost like salt and pepper, and tastes dry, beefy and also a bit like raspberries and black tea. It's a great change of pace and very interesting to taste.",US-California-Grenache
A beautiful wine that has plenty of weight and also a firm structure of minerality to go with the yellow fruits that are now evolving into more mature flavors. It is by no means at its peak yet. Give it 2–3 years.,France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A perfumed wine, it has a smooth texture contrasting with tight acidity. It's light, fruity and still needs a little time to develop. The soft tannins don't suggest long aging. Drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Candied and thin on the nose, and that's pretty much what follows. The palate is dilute, while the flavors of red fruits are crisp and semisour. Scratchy and tart on the finish as well.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A soft, full-bodied wine, this has touches of caramel and ripe strawberry flavors. It is rounded, smooth and rich, while the acidity adds the essential freshness.",France-Provence-Rosé
"An interesting experiment, this Pinot Gris is fermented on the skins, then aged in neutral oak for six months. It's a pale rose color, and the skin contact has resulted in some quite puckery phenolics. The barrel aging helps round it out, though it remains almost sour, with light, astringent strawberry fruit.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Old vines give extra concentration to this rich wine. With fruitiness, a tight texture and the need to age, it has structure and density. Drink from 2015.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"After spending 20 months in a mix of French and American oak, this full-bodied Shiraz is imbued with seductive notes of vanilla and baking spices. But there are also plenty of plummy fruit and savory undertones of espresso and roasted meat. It's supple enough to drink now, although it should last through at least 2025.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"This is a wine that brings out a soft, tropical character allied to a citrus and a herbaceous element. It's open, attractive and soft, and it's ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Fresh hibiscus, black plum and smashed olallieberry meet with vibrant florality and wide range of dark spice on the nose of this blend of 70% Grenache and 30% Syrah. A pepper-laced structure releases flavors of black cherry, cola and a touch of charcoal on the well-hewn palate.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Tight and tannic, this 99% Cabernet Sauvignon also has 1% Petit Verdot, which provides a faint floral note to the bouquet that is otherwise punctured by ripe swirls of cherry, vanilla and coconut, themes that repeat on the palate. Hard to penetrate fully, the wine needs time to open in the glass to reveal its charms.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Concentrated and generous in sweet red fruit, this is a gangbuster Oakville Merlot for the price. Balanced in fruit, herb and dry tannin, it's a lovable quaff from a well-known vineyard.",US-California-Merlot
"This bottling of one of the Central Coast's most promising white grapes is light and lithe on the nose with apples, lemon zest, lilies and a touch of vanilla bean. The palate is also delicate, showing apple blossoms, sour apple candy and cut pear.",US-California-Grenache Blanc
"A serious wine that needs aging, this is full and ripe while also having a steely edge to it. Very perfumed, floral and strongly textured, this is an impressive wine that does need extended aging. Drink from 2016.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"This succulent wine opens with an intensely spicy nose of white and black pepper accented with ripe berry. The sleek, savory palate delivers juicy black cherry and cooking spice framed in solid but refined tannins. It's made to be enjoyed young and paired with everyday fare.",Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto
"The nose was interesting; earthy with plenty of plummy fruit and a touch of musk. On the palate, with the fruit more muted, the earthiness became more apparent, and what fruit remained thinned out even more as it reached the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"From the gravel soils of northeast Italy, this pure expression of Chardonnay offers bright aromas of papaya, banana, exotic fruit and white peach. There's a touch of spice and almond on the close.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Chardonnay
"This easy-drinking wine has a light spiciness like cinnamon in the aroma, good cherry flavors and a smooth but slightly tangy texture. Not too full bodied, it shows good balance.",US-California-Red Blend
"Moderate in oak and well-structured, this estate-grown wine is subdued and classy, with defined layers of green olive, juicy apple and lemongrass, a tiny hint of jalapeño adding a touch of spice. Food-friendly, it'll complement a versatile range of dishes.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A full blast of very ripe peach hits the nose. The palate adds a touch of lemony freshness and a sweet rose perfume to this, creating an off-dry, floral and fruity swirl across the palate. There is something gentle about this, something charming and friendly. The lemony freshness keeps everything on the bright vivid side. The finish is lasting and off dry.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Fresh and juicy, this wine delivers round, ripe strawberry flavors. Solid tannins don't lose sight of the freshness of the year and balance the rich, jammy aftertaste. The wine, with its attractive fruits, will develop quickly. Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
Crisp pears and apples abound in this light-bodied dry Riesling. It's delicate in concentration but pleasantly lemony. The wine finishes briskly but freshly.,US-New York-Riesling
"A bit brusque and common in texture, with all kinds of edges. But the blackberry, cherry and mint flavors are rich and interesting. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Blackberry and cassis aromas are a touch balsamic but mostly clean. This feels solid and hefty, with slightly overripe black-fruit flavors. A low-acid finish results in flatness.",Chile-Central Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"There is plenty of ripe fruit here. With soft tannins and a generous structure, the wine is rich, full of berry and red-plum flavors and with just enough tannins. Give this fruity wine until 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"91-93. Barrel sample. A bright, fruit-forward wine that already shows its delicious blackberry flavors. It is ripe and juicy, with a layer of finely integrated tannins.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Hooray! A terrific Zin that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg. It’s loaded with personality, with quintessential aromas and flavors of wild berries and spices, and added complexities of roasted coffeebean, anise and white chocolate. Best Buy.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This overtly spicy wine is very intense, with a slight burn on the palate from the pepper flavor. Exotic white fruit and a hint of pomegranate are the flavors. It has a hard, final edge from its alcohol.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Now blossoming, this wine from a generally fruity vintage is delicious to drink. Poised and stylish, it shows integrated black fruit and wood, feeling balanced and almost ready. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Past its sell-by date, with mealy aromas and dull flavors of apple and banana. The feel is flat, the acidity is not there, and the finish is bland and a little bitter.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Sauvignon Blanc
"With just the right weight, this is a warm, rich and ultimately deliciously refreshing wine. Creamed apples, a tangy texture of clean acidity. Good as an aperitif, also with food. Screwcap.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"Both smooth and beautifully fruity, this is a balanced, delicious wine. It is full of wild strawberry flavors, the freshest acidity and a crisp finish with great acidity. It's a good choice with food and as an apéritif.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Aromas of raspberry, black licorice, woodspice, toast and cherry are followed by abundant red- and black-fruit flavors. There's plenty of richness and a finish that won't quit.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"A wine made from dried Moscatel with Sherry characteristics? This is that and more. Aromas of raisin, cinnamon, flowers and caramel are particular for dessert wines. In the mouth, this is fresh and juicy but substantive, with caramel, toffee, coffee and spice flavors running onto a long finish with toffee and chocolate notes. This is ripe and sweet but balanced and delicious.",Spain-Andalucia-Sherry
"Huckleberry, blackberry, coffee and bramble aromas lead to full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors in this wine. It's appealing despite the heavy-handed oak.",US-Washington-Syrah
"In this rich, earthy wine, plum and licorice flavors combine with a core of tough tannins. It is rich, fruity and ready to drink.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This full-bodied red opens with aromas of ripe plum, vanilla, toast and mocha. The chewy palate doles out ripe blackberry, juicy black cherry, licorice, baking spice and a confectionary note alongside velvety tannins. It's already accessible so enjoy soon.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"This eccentric Chard marches to its own beat. It's drier and more acidic than most, and the flavors offer a mélange of peaches, oranges, tropical fruits, Meyer lemons, cashews and white flowers. Yet it's delicious and compelling. Made with full-throttle techniques that include partial barrel fermentation, malolactic fermentation and battonage, it was bottled unfined and unfiltered. The vineyards are Sierra Madre, in the Santa Maria Valley, and Oaks Savannah, in the Santa Ynez Valley.",US-California-Chardonnay
"There isn't much Zin in Washington, but this makes a good case for more. Thick and tannic, it's a meaty, dark wine that includes 25% Petite Sirah. Seventeen months in new American oak has left an indelible whisky-barrel scent. —P.G.",US-Washington-Zinfandel
"In this polished and composed wine, subtle aromas of minerals, plums and spices are followed by a firm, slightly tannic texture that seems to relax with each sip. The flavors resemble plums and black cherries, plus hints of cinnamon, dill and dark chocolate. Save this for an elegant occasion after 2018.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Fairly light aromas of red cherry juice, licorice and dried violets show on the nose, following by a rather light density on the palate as well. Hints of minty cherry and charred wood also arise, as do grippy tannins that vanish quickly.",US-California-Merlot
"Fresh apple and pear aromas are lifted with hints of white flowers and honeydew on this full-bodied, elegantly balanced wine. The palate is slick with a drizzle of cream adding richness to flavors of apple and lemon, but balanced with bright acidity and a brisk saline finish.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"A griottier is an orchard of bitter cherry trees. This is fruity yet lean, with a cherry flavor. It has a hollow center, with more tannins than fruit.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Dense and woody, this blends 58% Cabernet Sauvignon with 18% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Richly layered, it's tannic and robust in oak, allowing a delicate rendering of cassis and red currant to show quietly.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a rich wine, with a texture that's comfortably cushioned by ripe cherry and plum flavors. It's a wine to savor now, full and fruity.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"The tannins are still hard as nails in this five-year-old Cabernet. It's like chewing on sandpaper, but the black currant and cassis flavors are powerful. An old-fashioned wine that could develop over the years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Flat and somewhat disjointed, this wine offers a strong taste of eucalyptus in a light-bodied, simply structured frame.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This blend of 80% Montepulciano and 20% Merlot opens with aromas of berry, mocha and toasted coffee bean. The palate is friendly and forward, with plum and blackberry accompanied by a hint of chocolate.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"A mixed bag of varieties went into this soft and fruity wine. It has gentle tannins that are lifted by acidity and black currant fruitiness. With its lifestyle label (a small Vespa motor scooter), it is obviously meant to be an easy-going ready-to-drink wine. And it succeeds.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese Red
"Pretty astringent in young tannins now, this Syrah has a tough, lockdown quality that suggests aging. You could have it with beef and barbecue, but it really wants three or four years of cellaring to start to mellow and show off the black currants and cherries.",US-California-Syrah
"This wine starts out seemingly reduced, with aromas of sulfur and funk in front of berry and smoke. The palate is lightly styled with grainy tannins. There are good things going on if the reduction blows off.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Soft and thick, this Zin tastes like very ripe, crushed blackberries, mixed into melted chocolate and fancied up with a sprinkling of anise, cassis and black pepper. It's very dry, but the alcohol, which is 17%, makes it finish sweet.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A very nice Pinot. You might call it well-behaved. It's clean, dry and crisp, showing good coastal character in the acid-brightened cherry and pomegranate flavors that are enriched with a little smoky oak.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A very intriguing nose from winemaker Brian Loring is reminiscent of ripe red cherries stewed in a béchamel sauce laced with cinnamon sticks. The palate dives deep into blackberries, black tea, beet juice and all sorts of cherries (red, black and sour), lifted by freshly crushed anise seeds.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"It is rare to find a Müller-Thurgau with such flavor, but Pojer and Sandri have a penchant for getting more than most out of lesser grape varieties. This wine has broad fruit flavors along with a crisply aromatic aftertaste.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Müller-Thurgau
"Loin de l'Oeil and Mauzac are the prime grapes in this attractive and perfumed wine. It is crisp and with a strong citrus streak as well as a more textured mineral edge. The wine is light, refreshing and ready to drink.",France-Southwest France-White Blend
"Very firm and tannic, this gently earthy Merlot-dominated blend also includes 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc. Cranberry and pomegranate red fruits are softened with buttery oak, and the wine shows more polish than in previous vintages.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Reddish in color, with raspberry and other high-toned aromas. The palate is fleshy but clean, with good acidity pushing slightly sweet cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes with sugar and a good mouthfeel. Gets the job done.",Spain-Northern Spain-Rosé
"A wine that balances considerable sweetness against the most exhilarating freshness. It has honey, yellow fruits, orange peel alongside touches of greener plums and herbs. A great aperitif wine.",France-Southwest France-White Blend
"Yes, that is the correct spelling, as shown on the wine's label. A blend of 10% Merlot, 56% Syrah, and 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is dark, plum-colored and dusty with scents of plum and prune. Soft and moving quickly into midlife, it drinks like an older wine, with soft tannins and a hint of supple leather.",US-Oregon-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A soft, simple wine, the tannins set the pace, but the fruit doesn't quite follow. It is relatively light, with some red fruits and good acidity.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"KJ's Mendocino County Zin has both red and black berry fruit flavor and the spiciness one expects from dry-farmed Mendocino County vineyards, though the tannins stick around a bit longer than one might like. Cedar definitely shows up on the finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This opens with aromas of leafy underbrush, mature berry, menthol and anise. The palate offers dried blackberry, raisin and licorice alongside close-grained tannins and brisk acidity.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"The 2011 Estate Selection brings flavors of rhubarb, citrus and tart raspberry, along with suggestions of pine needles and chocolate. It's well structured and proportionate—a good reflection of the vintage and Willamette Valley-style Pinot Noir.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Rich, forward and delicious, this has pineapple and peach jam flavors, with elaborate notes of buttered toast and caramel from the oak aging. It finishes dry.",US-California-Chardonnay
"From the extreme wilds near Annapolis, this vineyard-designate is rapaciously earthy in all the right ways, a taste of its environs, sauvage and demanding. Dark cherry and blueberry exude on the nose and follow through on the palate, in between jolts of baking spice and dried herb. Medium bodied, the wine is on the money right now, but should also do well in the bottle for years to come.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Raspberry and plum aromas set a forceful tone for this tannic, pinchy Malbec. Flavors of plum and mixed berries are generic, while this finishes grapy, tannic and with a note of clove.",Argentina-Other-Malbec
"A selection from the many parcels owned by the producer, this wine comes from the north slopes of the Montagne de Reims. It is a delicious, balanced wine that is 50-50 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, rich and full in the mouth with perfumed acidity and a generous texture. The wine is ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"An amazing wine, massively concentrated in fruit, yet beautifully balanced. Clearly one of the greatest California Syrahs of the vintage. Dry and complex, it shows intricate flavors of blackberries, Canadian bacon, mushu pork sauce, black pepper and smoky cedar flavors. Gorgeous and compelling, but far too young. Drink 2012–2018.",US-California-Syrah
"Surely there is no other Syrah-Tempranillo-Merlot-Dolcetto-Graciano-Petit Verdot-Nebbiolo-Cabernet Franc-Grenache-Muscat-Viognier-Tannat-Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon in the world? What's it taste like? Well, red table wine is as good a description as can be offered. Racy red fruits, mineral, bitter chocolate, good grip, spicy tannins—bring on the burgers.",US-Oregon-Red Blend
"Some overripe raisin flavors give this Zin a bitter taste, although it's totally dry. Shows flavors of chocolate and spicy blackberry jam.",US-California-Zinfandel
"The entry-level wine at the Faulkner family's estate, this is easygoing, ripe and bright, with citrus plus cherry and strawberry flavors. With soft texture and lively acidity, it will be very drinkable on its own.",France-Provence-Rosé
"The chalky soil conveys a cool feeling to this wine. Tight and mineral, it has yellow fruits that show good acidity. Toasty wood gives a juicy aftertaste. It's already delicious, but the wine's cool character will develop further, so drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Pretty whiffs of rose petal and stone fruit mark this fragrant sunny semidry Riesling. Suggesting delicate extractions of apricot and white peach, it's softer and rounder on the palate than Keuka Lake Vineyard's dry Rieslings. The finish is brisk and citrus.",US-New York-Riesling
"A mellow touch of ripe Red Delicious apple hovers on the nose. The palate brims with rich fruit, showing candied pear and dried apple. This richness is countered by a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge and a pure streak of fresh zestiness. A touch of sandalwood and cinnamon adds spice around the edges. While this is attractive now, it will reward cellaring as far more interesting notes of spice and fruit are sure to develop. Drink 2020–2030.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"For such a competitively priced offering, this delivers a lot of complexity. Dried herbs, anise, chocolate and coffee notes add nuance to the raspberry fruit. It's medium bodied and supple, with a lush, lingering finish. Drink now–2020.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"A light, fresh wine, with flavors of crushed strawberries. There is sweetness, softness, and a rounded aftertaste. Screwcap.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir

"This is a 100% varietal, vineyard-designated wine, impressive in its ability to provide lush richness within a balanced context. Dark and thick, it opens with blackberry, mocha and spicy clove flavors. Although syrupy, it maintains freshness on the palate.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
An intensely spicy bouquet with exotic fruit tones and freshly milled white pepper sets the tone for this pretty Pecorino. The mouthfeel is driven by round yellow fruit and apricot.,Italy-Central Italy-Pecorino
"Alpha is a new offering from Market Vineyards, and boosts the flavor meter past the winery's excellent, value-priced Benchmark Merlot. Tightly-structured and showing a barrel-heavy mix of dark, toasted flavors, this complex effort brings lead pencil, clove, charred meat and black fruits into play. Enjoy it with your thick grilled steak, or tuck it away until 2020–2022.",US-Washington-Merlot
"With moderate alcohol, this Pinot is silky and delicate in the mouth, with excellent acidity. Yet it's intense in sunshiney-ripe raspberries and cherries, as well as a hint of mushrooms that will become more pronounced with age. Defines the lighter style of California Pinot, in a gracious, elegant style.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"The aromas of this Chardonnay are zesty and fresh yet rich, with barrel smoke, caramelized pear and vanilla tones. The integration continues on the palate, with a bit of oak followed by apple, white peach, nectarine and lime zest. It's flavorful and enjoyable now.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a pretty impressive wine being offered for an almost unheard-of price, the fruit sourced largely from Russian River Valley and the Sonoma Coast. Cardamom and cinnamon figure in, with a lightness of body and high-toned strawberry and cherry belying an underlying richness that'll satisfy.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"The Ironstone Pressings features enough rough edges at this stage to think it will benefit from a few years of cellaring. The tart cherry notes are angular, the tannins a bit chunky, but tea leaf and spice notes provide ample complexity. Try in 2013.",Australia-South Australia-G-S-M
"This straightforward red opens with aromas suggesting stewed plum, prune and a hint of nutmeg. The jammy, extremely approachable palate offers black cherry, clove and cinnamon alongside rounded tannins. Drink through 2018.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Still young, this is a wine with fruit and acidity that dominate. At the moment, it is about stalky red berry fruits that need to soften into the smoky background. The aftertaste is perfumed and fresh. Let the wine age until 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Cabernet Franc
"While the nose is toasted, raw and spicy, the palate is weighty and legit, with grabby tannins and generic but solid flavors of mixed berries, herbal notes and oak. The finish is savory and slightly barbecued in flavor.",Argentina-Other-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Bold and fruity, this ripe wine has rich black fruits that are still tied to young tannins. A ripeness to the fruit will allow the wine to age, with tannins softening and filling out. Drink from 2017.",France-Provence-Provence red blend

The flavors are well integrated on the sip, with tangy boysenberry, a pinch of sage and crushed black-pepper spice, with a strong acidity that rises in the midpalate.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"There is tons of lively action packed into the nose of this wine, from rosebuds and zesty cherry cola to cinnamon spice and rainbow peppercorns. The texture is relatively light on the sip, and yet grippy tannins and a bursting acidity swim across the palate, showing vibrant iron and red-fruit flavors.",US-California-Grenache
"Smells different than most, with blueberry, carob and exotic sandalwood. Takes a dive on the palate, where it's sweet, syrupy and flat, almost like prune juice. Along those lines, it tastes pruny, with chocolate on the finish. Struggles to achieve balance.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This is a style of wine that offers a blockbuster view of Bordeaux. It is full of dark extracted fruits, brooding tannins, dark plum juice and a burnt feeling that comes from alcohol. In its style, it goes for excess.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A tiny-production wine from a windblown ridge in the Petaluma Gap, Badger Block is earthy and piquant in wild strawberry. Spicy and soft, it's almost velvety on the palate. Persistent in depth and length, the body is generous but balanced, spiked with the scent of fresh-picked rose petals.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"From the Loire Valley's Bourgeois family, this is a firmly built wine from a region known more for its open-knit accessibility. Sturdy beet and black cherry notes seem destined to last, framed by firm tannins. Drink 2015–2020.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir

"This blend is principally Cabernet Sauvignon (48%), Cabernet Franc (23%) and Merlot (20%), with the balance Petit Verdot and Malbec.

"Already beautiful, this comes from an estate that's managed by Louis Jadot in Puligny-Montrachet, always producing fine wines. It's smooth and toasty, although it is already showing ripe yellow fruits and fragrant acidity. Although drinkable now, it really needs to age, so keep until 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Smashed berries, honeyed coffee, leather, beef jerky, cola and black pepper show on the nose of this complex wine by the legendary Hearst family.

"At 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this is a sculpted, perfumed second-vintage red with cranberry as well as cherry fruit and well-integrated oak. What makes this a winner, especially with food, is that the crystalline, racy fruit far outshadows the oak. It's not old-school, but you'd still have to call it a traditional Tuscan wine.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Fresh and fruity, this already-attractive wine offers bright acidity, a lightly herbal edge and a tangy citrus texture. It is ready to drink. The estate is owned by the Perrin family of Château Carbonnieux.",France-Bordeaux-Sauvignon Blanc
"The balance between wood aging and fruit is at its best in this wine. It shows plenty of red fruits filled out with raisins and nutmeg. As a contrast the wood aging has brought out a spicy, almond character. It is fresh, on the dry side for an aged tawny and, of course, ready to drink.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Gentle scents of perfume, wild berry and cedar blend seamlessly on the nose. The palate is more punchy and tight, with heavy extraction creating narrow flavors of blackberry and cassis. A short, sinewy finish limits the wine's breadth.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A tiny-production wine made to honor the legacy of Jimmy Valvano, this Cab is huge, leathery and possibly not for everyone. For those who do like a complexity of funk, this one delivers, with a massive mouthfeel of minerality, finished in black licorice and chocolate.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"The Menzies is Yalumba's top Coonawarra Cabernet, and its quality has improved tremendously over recent vintages. The 2008 is pure and ripe, with great black-cherry and cassis flavors, framed by an elegant vanilla-oak note. It's full bodied and plushly textured without being unstructured, and it should drink well over the next 15 years.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Plum, cassis, floral hints and spicy, charred aromas open this Syrah-led blend. Hailing from a warm year, this feels jammy, dense and full in body. Peppery, chocolaty blackberry flavors end dark and deep, with a strong aftershock of olive and herbal flavors. Drink through 2019.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Red Blend
"There's great personality here thanks to the wine's bright fruit flavors, vibrant color and penetrating balsam notes that add depth and dimension.

The mouthfeel is medium-bodied but firm and showcases the pure fruit characteristics of Sangiovese.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese

"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of black cherry, blue flower and baking spice. The straightforward palate delivers red plum and clove alongside firm tannins. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"One of the nice things about this Pinot Noir is that despite the considerable quantities produced (17,000 cases), it doesn't seem forced in any way. It's medium bodied and silky, with aromas and flavors of maraschino cherries and button mushrooms that leave a pretty, delicate impression behind on the palate.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"This affordable wine impresses in smoky, charred oak and a full, robust profile that it embraces completely. Leather, blackberry and black pepper combine on the palate for power and a lengthy, lasting impression on the finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Heavy and dense, with a soft texture and melted, thick tannins. Lacks structure and vitality, although the blackberry, currant, chocolate and spice flavors are very good.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Plusher and rounder than the Special Reserve bottling, Millbrook's standard label Merlot suggests soft red-cherry flavor accented with cocoa powder, savory mushroom and beetroot. Gentle acidity and fine-grained tannins accentuate its plump juicy feel. Drink now through 2019.",US-New York-Merlot
"Don't let the rather light red color fool you. This is an assertive Zinfandel with an edgy, oaky, smoky character in the aroma and the flavor. It blends powerful, sweet-seeming oak notes with attractive cherry and raspberry flavors, and is very full-bodied.",US-California-Zinfandel
"From the producer's monumental Atlas Peak vineyard, this is a tightly wound, solidly constructed mountain Cab, blended with a handful of Petit Verdot. Tobacco, black tea and a sliver of coconut intermingle around a medium-bodied whole that will benefit from cellaring, through 2021.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A strong blast of tire rubber dominates the nose. In the mouth, this wine feels narrow and tannic. Dark berry flavors are almost burnt tasting and come with a note of dark chocolate, leading to a charred finish.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A first release, this wine offers light suggestions of red apple, herbs and tropical fruit. It's medium bodied yet leaner in style with tart acids but the concentration doesn't seem all there.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc

"Hard to describe the balance and elegance of this Cabernet Franc, although it's pretty hard in tannins. Below that is a fabulous core of blackberry, black cherry and mineral flavors. Rich, complex and dramatic, this is arguably one of the best Cab ernet Francs on the market. Drink now–2017.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"The best of Belle Glos's 2008 Pinots. It's notable for the extreme richness of the raspberries and cherries, which have a jammy intensity with even more succulent notes of vanilla cream and smoky butter. But the finish is dry, while acidity and tannins bring the wine to earth. Delicious now and through 2014.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A rich wine, this has a mineral as well as a fruity character. With a high proportion of Chardonnay in the blend, it is full of orange peel, apple and pink grapefruit flavors that are refreshing, with a crisp kick at the end.

"This is a tremendous, powerful Chardonnay that swamps the mouth with ripe fruit and oak. It detonates with pineapple crème brûlée, peach tart, buttered toast and vanilla flavors, and while it's dry, it has a honey-sweet finish and a crisp, citrus acid tartness. Drink now.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Scents of blackberries, char and smoky herbs lead onto the medium-bodied, streamlined palate, which bears fine, sinewy tannins that lend a crunchy edge.",US-Virginia-Petit Verdot
"A fine Zin that shows its Dry Creek origins in a classic way. It's dry, briary, brambly and heady, with wild forest berry, pine, anise and sweet cedar flavors. Nice now with steak, short ribs or barbecue, and will hold and develop interestingly over the next 6–8 years.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Peach pit and apricot aromas are subdued. The palate is pulpy and fruity, with a light cut of acidity. Pithy flavors of orange and quince end with minor notes of bitterness and greens.",Chile-Central Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"The unusually low finished alcohol suggests grapes picked a bit early. Scents of violets and light flavors of purple plums give way to an herbal midpalate, with streaks of graphite and bitter chocolate. The tannins are stiff and assertive.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A certain faint spiciness hovers over everything, recalling honeysuckle. The textured palate is fresh and equally pepper-spiced. This has freshness and verve, a certain ease and tons of lemony crispness. If you wanted to hold a party to welcome summer, this would be the perfect wine.",France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"A beautiful Sauvignon Blanc that does everything you want with this variety. It's basically dry and crisp in acidity, with polished flavors of lemongrass, pineapple tart, vanilla, buttered toast and steely minerals. Really nice wine at a great price.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"What makes this Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon blend stand out are its pristine balsam notes. Those beautifully pungent aromas are followed by exotic spice, black cherry, maple syrup and tobacco. The wine boasts deep concentration of color and flavors and obvious sophistication. It's a bit thick and sticky in the mouth with heavy wood tones and gritty tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Vanilla, oak spice, tea, berry, olive and herb aromas signal a classic Rioja. Its crisp palate and choppy tannins form the canvas for spicy berry and cassis flavors. More spice powers the finish, which has the fruit to absorb and support the high level of oak. Drink through 2025.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Rich and soft, this has a creamy smooth texture, with notes of toast, ripe apple and quince. There is a good touch of acidity to this attractive, ready to drink wine.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese White

"This bottling from Fintan du Fresne has all the hallmarks of savory, cool-climate Syrah: deep blackberry aromas wrapped in black pepper, rosemary, game and tar. The palate adds pine and boysenberry to the mix, making for a compelling and lively wine.",US-California-Syrah
"With fruit selected from a single-vineyard site, this riserva does a nice job of portraying a fresh cherry flavor within an elaborate framework of oak spice, leather and tobacco notes. The wine is propped up by tight wood-derived tannins, which gives it a firm structure. It could use a few more years of cellar aging",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A best-of-barrels blend from the classic Bordeaux varieties, this wine is delicious. It's not hard for Napa to ripen fruit to blackberry and cherry perfection, or for the winemaker to age the wine in the best oak. What's difficult is to house all this richness in such smooth tannins, with such depth and such a pure finish. A spectacularly good wine to drink now, and it should develop for at least a decade.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Deep and rich in this landmark Oregon vintage, this Pinot Blanc abounds with flavors of buttered pears, toast and vanilla custard. The texture and balance are spot-on, and the wine is flat-out delicious.",US-Oregon-Pinot Blanc
"Deep purple in color, and soupy on the nose, with a strong hint of lemon. The palate is almost astringent due to elevated acidity, thus the balance of this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon-Bonarda blend is sketchy. Tastes more like grape juice than fine wine, with a hollow, tangy finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"So dark the wine stains the glass the instant it's poured, this plush, dense and pure varietal effort pulls together crushed raspberries, ripe cherries, tanned leather, cut tobacco, cedar and spice components. They are well-matched and captivating; the aromas are like sticking your nose into an especially spicy cigar box.",US-Oregon-Malbec
"Bold and juicy, this is a ripe, forward wine. With red berry fruits prominent, it conveys attractive fruitiness. Tannins in the background suggest medium-term aging. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Putting aside the bling of the gold embossed design of the bottle, this Champagne shows the light character of most Piper-Heidsieck wines. However, there is one extra element: the woody, toasty character that provides both maturity and an element of tension. Not for keeping, but a wine that comes in on the serious side of lightness.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"A bit volatile, with a hint of fusil, light herb and cut grass flavors, and fruit that is just ripe enough. Green banana and green apple, with a soft mouthfeel and a gentle fade.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"A single estate run by Joseph Mellot, this produces an impressive ripe style of Sauvignon Blanc, at this stage youthful with exuberant white fruits and grapefruit, and an obvious need to age for 1–2 years.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"A good Cabernet, dry and classic in black cherry, currant, plum jam and cedar flavors. It's a little irregular in the mouth, with cutting acidity, and its future is uncertain. Give it a long decant.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
This wine shows plum and toasted oak sensations with hints of animal and barnyard. The palate offers overripe black fruit flavors along with astringent tannins that cut the finish short.,Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Dry and common, with thinned-down cherry and cola flavors, wrapped into a silky texture. Acidity is high, and the wine tastes a little sour.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Now developing into an impressive, maturing wine, this is rich and complex. It has well integrated tannins that bring out sweet acidity, spice and finely lightly roasted coffee. Ready to drink, it should certainly keep for at least six years and probably more.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A wood-aged Chardonnay from the hills above Soave, this is rich, honeyed from the malolactic fermentation and full of tropical fruit flavors. It is rich and delicious, but also well structured.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Chardonnay
"At this price, you can expect an honest, workmanlike everyday wine, and you get that here—along with other qualities that will surprise you. Not least is the fruit, nicely ripened and finely etched, and the spices that dance on the tongue. It's dry, of course, with fine acidity. What stands out is the depth of flavor.",Chile-Central Valley-Chardonnay
"Chuck Reininger sources the fruit for this wine from what is arguably the best site in the Walla Walla Valley. The wine does not shy away from the herbal aspect for which Carmenère is known, but the stemminess is mitigated thanks to the influence of new French oak. A cherry candy note consolidates the flavors on the medium-long finish.",US-Washington-Carmenère
"The reserve spends 18 months in French oak, and includes a portion of 30-year-old vines in the blend. Raspberry and cherry fruit carries a suggestion of earth, and the alcohol, though moderate, adds some heat to the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Barrel-fermented and pungent, with a whiff of glue, this has a simple mix of mint and wax aromas.",US-Oregon-Viognier
"This cheerful Rosso di Montalcino offers a distinctively oak-driven bouquet of smoke, spice and mesquite followed by a bright ensemble of berry fruit aromas. The wine is soft and slightly sweet on the finish with a burst of cherry and blueberry at the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso

"With chocolate as well as fruit flavors, this is a structured wine. A bitter edge gives the juicy damson fruit a jolt. However, it should develop well to give a ripely textured wine from 2016.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Neutral on the nose to the point of dull and mute. The palate is more wet than complex, and the flavors of apple, candy and toffee are basic at best. For a half-bottle priced at $25, this is underwhelming and far too simple in all facets.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine is rich with smooth ripe fruit that give the impression that it is off dry. In fact, it is the intensity of the fruit that is the driving force behind the wine. With acidity strongly in the background, there is a crisp element to this fine lemon and apricot-flavored wine. Drink from 2019.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"Quite a good Cabernet, virgorous and dry, with an earthy edge of sweet, dried herbs alongside the blackberries and cedar. More elegant and food-friendly than many of the fruitier, high alcohol, oaky Cabs out there.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"With its inky black color and intense, dense aromas of black fruits, leather, spice and herbs, Almirez is a poster child for Toro. The palate is firm but offers cushion, while flavors of toast, wood, roasted berry, cassis and licorice finish long, wild and leathery. Drink through 2019.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro
"Concentrated aromas of honey, golden raisin, date, jasmine and fig are lifted by a nutty walnut component that adds intrigue on the late harvest bottling. The viscous sip grabs hold of attention immediately, with buoyant and bright acidity holding up the honey and raisin flavors.",US-California-Viognier

"Sourced from the O'Shaughnessy Vineyard across from the producer's winery on Oakville Cross Road, this is a youthfully shy wine, firm in integrated and expansive tannin. Tobacco, clove, cedar and cherry interweave themselves flavorfully on the palate, with plenty of length shining through on the finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a crisp, creamy white wine, with lingering acidity that offers a tartness of preserved lemon and stone.",US-California-Chenin Blanc
"Abundantly rich in fruit, this Cabernet shows its California origins in the incredibly ripe blackberry, cherry and chocolate flavors. It's sweet, almost like pie filling, except the finish is thoroughly dry. Thick mountain tannins make for astringency, suggesting ageworthiness. The window of drinkability looks like 2014-2016.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Crushed boysenberry is foremost on the nose and palate, while a rounded, supple but defined structure makes this a winning choice for subtle foods. There is both elegance and length and a lovely, integrated touch of well-handled oaky vanilla.",Austria-Burgenland-Zweigelt
"This appealing, southern Rhône blend is a Châteauneuf-du-Pape style, with lush, forward red fruits and pleasing traces of the estate vineyard's characteristic dusty tannins.",US-Washington-Red Blend

Crisp citrus, stone fruit, pear and honey aromas are delivers in an easy and attractive manner. This is an informal wine that will enhance many of your favorite summer foods.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"Shows some older notes: a bouquet of toasted white bread, cinnamon, brown sugar and smoky yeast, with just the slightest hint of white pepper. Really rich and complex, with supple lime flavors offsetting the earthy impression. Very dry, with an overall excellent palate impression. Should continue to age and grow finer.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Thyme, bay and lavender aromas provide strong regional character to this wine, a blend of 70% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 10% Carignan. Mixed berries form the core of this supple wine, which should be consumed over the next couple of years.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Like many Mornington producers, Kooyong has a relatively short track record (founded 1996). For much of that time, winemaking was under the guidance of Sandro Mosele, including this stunning 2012. It shows Burgundian levels of complexity in its array of smoke, leather, root vegetable and black cherry notes, then backs that all up with a firm-yet-supple texture and tremendous length. Drink now through 2022.",Australia-Victoria-Pinot Noir
"Pretty and polished Pinot, with a light, delicate mouthfeel and good varietal flavors. Offers waves of cola, red licorice, cherry pie and sandalwood. Notable for its attention to detail, and could even develop over the next six years.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Made from vines planted in 1983, this is dry and textural, with crisp and complex lemon, tangerine and orange peel flavors. It's persistent and fleshy, finishing with a touch of minerality.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Aromas of cherry and plum are faint, while flavors of berry skin and citrus pith unfold on the light-weight palate. This is clean and approachable, with a short finish and subtle lingering astringency.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rosé
"Floral aromas are reminiscent of peach blossom and wisteria. The palate delivers green apple, Bartlett pear, passion fruit and a light vein of mineral alongside soft acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Bianco
"A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of red currant, clove and toast. The structured, elegant palate doles out plum, sage and tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017–2022.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"The vines behind this wine were planted in the 1960s and 1970s, qualifying them as old in the Napa Valley. Winemaker Lisa Warner uses native yeast as well as one from Montrachet to craft this muted, nutty Chardonnay. Richly textured it is otherwise awash in high-toned citrus, both lemon and pineapple.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Sturdy and tannic, this offers subtle suggestions of rosewater and cocoa powder around pleasant plum fruit. Drink it over the next two or three years; decanting will help to smooth it out.",US-Oregon-Tempranillo
"Winemaker Justin Mund worked at Laetitia for four years, so he knows the blocks, and picks this one well. The nose shows blackberry fruit but the unique parts are the beef blood and gamy pork aromas. It's sanguine on the palate at first, then opens to Bing cherries and eucalyptus oil.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Sourced from a single block at the top of the vineyard, this seems thin, especially for such a rich vintage. It's characterized by cola and root beer flavors, along with details of fennel, iron and earth.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"In 2012, Pizay made two whites: one labeled Burgundy and this one labeled Beaujolais. This is more in the apéritif style, fresh and fruity, full of apple flavors and with a touch of citrus at the end. It's ready to drink now.",France-Beaujolais-Chardonnay
"Only produced from Grand Cru vineyards, this ripe wine offers yellow fruit flavors cut by dry tangy citrus acidity. It's full in the mouth, with a creamy mousse and attractive freshness. The wine, with its hints of toast as well as fruit, is ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"From the estate vineyard, located in the cobblestone-rich area known as The Rocks, this cellar-worthy effort is complex and riveting. Berries and citrus, juicy and tart, cling to the palate and pull through to a lingering finish. Pure and deep all the way through.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Dr. L has developed into the sort of consistent, large-production wine consumers can depend on when faced with an otherwise unknown array of wines. The 2009 is off dry, with crisp acidity, lime and pineapple flavors and a mouthwatering finish. Drink it over the next year or so.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Here's a savory enjoyable red that opens with fruity aromas of wild berry, pressed blue flower and a whiff of culinary spice. The round juicy palate offers fleshy red cherry, crushed raspberry and a note of star anise alongside chewy tannins. It has an open, sunny charm.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This Roero offers very good intensity of aromas that are characterized by layers of white cherry, wild berry and exotic spice. The wine offers a soft, velvety feel in the mouth although those tight tannins definitely appear on the close.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Coming from one of the state's most esteemed Syrah sites, this wine opens with high-toned aromas of herb, blue fruit and iron, along with light savory accents. The flavors are full, broad and palate coating, showing an exquisite sense of balance and length that kicks it up a notch. Exquisite stuff.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Made with air-dried Passerina grapes in central Italy, this special dessert wine shows characteristic aromas of butterscotch, crème caramel, dried apricot and honey. It's sweet but not too heavy and would pair with dried cookies or sponge cake.",Italy-Central Italy-Passerina
"From Hautvillers, the village where Dom Pérignon worked, this small house has produced this ripe, fruity and well-balanced wine. Some bottle age gives a taste of yeast and toasted bagels as well as fruity apples and crisp pears. The bottle is ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This strikes a good balance between spicy oak, fruitiness and firm texture. It smells lightly spicy from oak barrels, and also fresh like red cherry and sweet plums. Rich and layered in feel, it finishes dry and full bodied. Not overblown, it has just the right mix of elements for the dinner table.",US-California-Meritage
"Perfume partners with great acidity in this wine. The two work in harmony, resulting in a wine that has a soft texture, rich, jammy berry fruits and a backbone of tannins that will allow for aging. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of this medium-bodied, un-oaked wine suggest sliced pears and apples, while the flavors are equally fruity but have a leaner feel. The texture is dry, firm and crisp, making this a great pairing for shellfish and many other dishes.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Fresh and easygoing, this opens with scents of berry, blue flower and a whiff of baking spice. The light-bodied simple palate offers tart cherry, black currant and a hint of espresso alongside soft, not very persistent tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Whiffs of caramel and honey accent sweet yellow apple and pear in this bright, easy going Riesling. Off dry in style, it offers delicate sweetness balanced by fresh acidity and a rounded, creamy mouthfeel. Drink now.",Germany-Rheinhessen-Riesling
"Crunchy acidity marks this Viognier, giving it a palate brightness and making the apricot, tangerine, peach, pear and honeysuckle flavors finish drier than they probably really are. It's an exotic, rich wine that drinks well with Vietnamese fare, or a peanut-starring Cambodian beef or chicken dish.",US-California-Viognier
"This is a concentrated wine with fine tannins and juicy black-plum fruits. It is densely textured, packed with great fruit and developing well. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is an easygoing Chardonnay-based sparkling wine (made in the classic method in which secondary fermentation occurs in the bottle) with pristine aromas of mature fruit and a touch of freshly baked bread. The quality of the effervescence is steady, creamy and tonic.",Italy-Lombardy-Chardonnay
"A solid, structured cru wine with a fine line in tannins and black-cherry fruits. It is dense with a firm, dry core. Surrounding it are ripe fruits and acidity. A wine to keep a few more months, so drink from late 2017.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This is 100% Pinot Gris, given 20 hours of skin contact, resulting in a “Gris de Gris” style of blush wine. It's light and dry, with strong scents and flavors of grapefruit.",US-Washington-Pinot Gris
"A hint of initial sulfur blows off almost completely to leave fresh aromas of stone fruit, melon and honey. This Chardonnay has good natural structure and offers fruit flavors.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Chardonnay
"This shows some aggressive tannins now, and the fruit is a little overripe, suggesting red currants and shrivelled raisins. It's also a touch high in alcohol. The tannins are fine and sturdy, but the wine lacks the balance to age. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Entirely estate-grown, 100% Merlot from old vines, this unfined wine is labeled vegan. Plush, briary, brambly fruit from the 30 year old vineyard brings an extra dimension to the wine, which shows a lovely balance of cranberry, raspberry, pie cherry and baking spice flavors. There's a hint of pastry crust in the finish, which is seamless and long. An absolute delight.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Aromas of espresso, mocha and black-skinned fruit lead the nose. The robust, one-dimensional palate offers black cherry, mint and licorice alongside close-grained tannins and fresh acidity.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A stunner of a rosé, this wine's pale pink hue does little to indicate its action-packed reality. Nectarine, wet stone, and bubble gum occupy the aroma profile, but the flavors are what set it off. Ruby red grapefruit, strawberry shortcake, and a slight lemon chiffon element hammer home this beauty by Sta. Rita Hills-based superstar producer Kris Curran, formerly of both Sea Smoke and Foley. This is versatile enough to handle both seared scallops and grilled babyback pork ribs.",US-California-Grenache
"Cherry and plum aromas come with overt notes of sucking candy and schist. In the mouth, this is grabby, raw and tannic, with mild astringency. Cherry, plum and boysenberry flavors run sweet and candied, while the finish is baked, with loamy weight. Drink through 2019.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"There is a bright but not overdone tropicality to this fresh and inviting wine, which shows lily, Gala apple and pear flesh on the nose and tightens up on gravel and citrus peel. The flavors are broad and easy, with a slight Granny Smith apple sharpness.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This blend is 56% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 22% Merlot, using grapes sourced entirely from this iconic Red Mountain vineyard. Notes of spice and iron interplay with tightly wound berry and cassis fruit. This is a steely, muscular wine, with an underpinning of graphite. History has proven that it will age beautifully.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Pretty dark for a blush, and very strongly flavored. The raspberry flavors veer into framboise, it's that extracted and liqueur-like. So there's nothing shy about it. Unusual and eccentric, but a pretty, flavorful wine. —S.H.",US-California-Grenache
"In the strange world of Champagne, Sec (dry) on the label means a wine that is less dry than Brut. It is more to do with fullness and weight than sugar. This wine bears ripe fruit, flavors of peaches, creamy pears and light nougat and spice character. Pair this with richly sauced foods.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Powerfully dark in color and strong in aromas of blackberry and chocolate, this smooth, sizable wine has big tannins that soften as they go. Black pepper, tobacco and cinnamon round out on the palate, before a lengthy finish of coconut and vanilla.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Mineral-driven and hard on the nose, this features toasty, smoky, chocolaty notes in addition to medicinal berry aromas. It feels juicy but also resiny and creamy, with plum and wood flavors that finish long. This is a ripe, fruity wine with plenty of oak, size and body.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"This light Pinot offers an elegant nose with tart cherry and leathery, earthy accents. It opens to a like palate, but the wine has an essentially lean, even sharp character, with rather high acidity for the thin fruit. Solid winemaking keeps the Pinot Noir character correct here, but the vintage's fruit essentially lacks the desired depth or ripeness.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Salt, chalk and grapefruit-pith aromas make for a judiciously restrained approach on the nose of this wine, which comes from heritage clones. The palate is mineral-driven with white rock flavors as well as green apple and lime-pith notes.",US-California-Chardonnay
"All the Lemelson Pinots in 2014 are strikingly similar—rather light, tart, clean and simple. Cranberry and raspberry fruit, bright and tangy, tells the whole story here. Drink it over the next few years while that freshness remains.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Cocoa, nutmeg and cinnamon aromas, generous and broad fruit flavors like blackberry jam and dried black cherries fill up this full-bodied wine. The silky texture is backed with fine tannins, and a lingering finish that echoes the fruit and chocolaty spices.",US-California-Syrah
"Ripe and juicy, a tremendously flavorful wine with sunshine-filled blackberries, black cherries, plums, licorice and chocolate. The tannins are thick and sticky, like a good Cab should have. Drink now with a grilled steak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Scents of green apple and plum lead the bouquet, with a strong lime-pith note that carries through to the palate. The texture is soft and somewhat flat on the midpalate, but ample acidity and a pleasant astringency help to lift the close. Drink now.",South Africa-Western Cape-Chenin Blanc
"Extremely dark in the glass, this bottling by a founder of the popular Garagiste Festival shows blueberry, black currant, dark chocolate, graphite and soft licorice on the nose. Deep and lavish but not overripe on the palate, flavors of anise, elderberry and black currant hang from a grippy structure bolstered by strong acidity. Drink 2018–2028.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is dry, crisp and nicely detailed, with a persistent, clean and fresh mouthfeel. Notes of cucumber, salad greens and citrus, notably lime and grapefruit, are underscored with appealing minerality. This remains one of the highlights of Chehalem's expansive portfolio.",US-Oregon-Grüner Veltliner
"This ripe, almond- and pear-flavored wine has a fine balancing structure of green fruit skins. It's certainly rich, but it also has elegance, restraining its exuberance through the finishing acidity, which promises 5–7 years' aging.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Cedarville's ode to Priorat, this is a mix of 45% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. The three get along swimmingly, amusingly mixing into a triad of dark blackberry, dark licorice and dark chocolate. The rich texture is on the mark, and the wine provides just the right heft for any spicy, brawny meal.",US-California-Red Blend
"It's enormously ripe and opulent in raspberries, persimmons and Dr. Pepper cola, with lots of toasty oak. The mouthfeel is light and silky, and the acidity is a delight. A fruity sweetness to the core turns dry and spicy on the finish. Drink now–2018.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Very smooth, almost thick, this is a rich wine in flavor and mouthfeel. It practically oozes over the palate, dripping with ripe pineapple, vanilla and cream, and coats every corner of the mouth before lingering through a long finish. It's full bodied, soft and concentrated.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Rugged, rustic, stalky aromas are a bit challenging. In the mouth, this is stout and tough, with hard tannins. Toasty blackberry flavors are mildly stalky and earthy, with peppery bitterness, while a firm, tight, tannic finish tastes of black peppercorn and blackberry. Drink through 2028.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Made with botrytized Grillo grapes, this dessert wine opens with aromas that recall dried peach and citrus zest. The rich, sweet palate offers lemon honey, candied tangerine slices and toasted almond.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Grillo
"This is a bold and expressive but not overly big wine. It smells wonderfully like clove and coriander, and tastes generously focused on classic black cherry and cedar notes. It's full bodied, but has great acidity and a lively layer of tannins to keep it balanced and refreshing.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A toasty touch of brioche joins ripe red and yellow-apple notes on the nose. The palate has even more of that autolytic richness, grounding both tart red apple and ripe lemon notes. Fine and creamy, the mousse highlights the fruit freshness while an earthier, toastier, richer background shimmers through enticingly. This harmonious and complex sparkler majors on beautiful development and pristine freshness. Lovely now, it is certain to develop further. Drink 2017–2025.",England-England-Sparkling Blend
"Spicy and precise, this is a Bordeaux mix, with sharp-edged cassis, black cherry and blackberry fruit, encased in a strong, fortress-like, oak stockade. Clearly a wine to decant, it's got plenty of power and 15.3% alcohol, yet retains a supple mouthfeel and sense of proportion.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Dark and quite oaky for a brand that earned its stripes via balanced wines that overdelivered. This vintage seems much more extracted and rough, with big, burly aromas and then tannins that grab the cheeks. Along the rough and tumble ride there's spice, pepper, blackberry and coffee. This wine pumps it out but is less polished than in the past.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Soulful and smooth, this conveys classic Sangiovese fragrances of ripe black cherry, leather, scorched earth, baking spice and crushed violet. The savory palate doles out ripe wild cherry, cinnamon, grilled herb, tobacco and mineral alongside big, velvety tannins and surprising freshness for the vintage. It's already delicious but will age for years. Drink through 2027. Grand Cru Selections, Oliver McCrum Wines.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"From one of the Russian River's premier Sauvignon Blanc producers, although recent vintages have slipped in quality. The '09 is a good wine, dry and crisp, with citrus, gooseberry and spice flavors. But it's missing the richness of earlier vintages.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Crisp plum and floral aromas rest on rocky base and offer up balsamic notes. This Monastrell-driven blend is full in body, with spicy, herbal, wild-brush flavors accenting core dark plum and berry. A lasting finish is herbal, deep and potent. Drink through 2017.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"Sprightly and clean, with full-throttle fruit and spice and a softly tannic texture. The pepper and wild-berry flavors are distinctive and delicious, and nicely dry. Try with pizza, or pasta with spicy sausages. Best Buy.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Broad notes of white orchard fruit lead onto the light- to medium-bodied palate, which feels easygoing and pliable.",US-Virginia-Chardonnay
"Very closed and tight, this is still a young wine. Its fruitiness, with citrus and pear flavors, is just beginning to develop into something that's rich and full-bodied. With its steely structure and taught acidity, it shouldn't be drunk before 2016.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This has the classic flavors of many Oregon Pinot Noirs, a balanced mix of tangy red fruits, mineral, earth and more than a hint of stem. It's full bodied and detailed, with excellent balance, weaving threads of site and grape into a complex finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Very rich and opulent. You can taste how the grapes had a long season to grow enormously ripe, delivering flavors of pineapples, pears and golden mangoes. Yet the cool vintage also preserved vital acidity. A delightful young Chardonnay for drinking now with upscale fare.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Always one of the top performers in Margaux, this dense and concentrated wine has a bold, ripe character from the plum and berry fruits. It has the weight to develop. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"From a selection of the original vines at this heritage vineyard, which was planted in the early 1970s, this is densely layered with strawberry, raspberry and cherry fruit. Details are well-integrated, bringing light notes of toasted coconut and caramel. The texture and mouthfeel express the little extras that old vines, when handled properly, can deliver.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Classic Sonoma Zinfandel, dry, spicy and elegant, with briary, brambly wild berry, tobacco, leather and pepper flavors. It's dry and rich in dusty tannins, and will hold for a good six years.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Greg La Follette, who made this wine, understands the Van der Kamp vineyard, where this wine comes from, better than anyone. It's a startling wine, rich and full-bodied, yet utterly delicious in youthful appeal. With a fine, dry structure, it offers enormous flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants, mocha, cinnamon and smoky oak, and the finish lasts for a full minute. Expensive, but all the proceeds are for charity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a simple, fruity Champagne, made to be drunk young. With its crisp citrus tang and bright acidity, it is well balanced with the soft dosage. The wine is dominated by Pinot Noir that grows so well in the Côte des Bar.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"With maturity beckoning, this wine already emphasizes its petrol, its herbal fruit character. The aromas of white flowers are there, but the acidity is less fruit, more texture, surrounding toast and lime jelly flavors. Screwcap.",Austria-Kamptal-Riesling
"This fragrant, spicy wine is soft and rounded. It is still developing to give a wine that will be warm and full. It misses something of the essential fruitiness.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This isn't a very complex Merlot, but it is textbook if you're looking for soft fruitiness. It has oak-influenced cherry and blackberry flavors, with hints of violets and fruit tea, and is dry and dusty in tannins. Give it more concentration and it would be a star.",US-California-Merlot
"Here is a carefully aged Barolo Riserva from the Pira cru (also known as La Rocca) with dark concentration backed by rose petal, hickory smoke, root beer, wet stone and moist mineral notes. It's a big, bold and masculine interpretation with an elegant, dusty mouthfeel and polished tannins. Drink now with pork stuffed with wild mushrooms.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This wine seems slightly past peak with aromas of overripe apple, lees and pear. It's lightly sweet with the concentration not seeming all there.",US-Washington-Pinot Gris
"Light and crisp, it offers layers of lemon chiffon and spicy pear. The at-first luxurious mouthfeel evolves smoothly into crisper, citrus-wrapped acidity. This is a sippable, ideal summer wine.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This blend of Grenache and Niellucciu comes from vines that are up to 40 years old. It is a big, bold ripe and juicy wine, bursting with black plum and berry flavors. The wine is fruity enough to drink now, although it should age for at least 10 years.",France-France Other-Red Blend
"Spicy, lemony acidity balances out a classic barrel imprint of oakiness and toast in this medium-bodied, concentrated wine. Silky-smooth on the palate, it rewards patience in the glass and will pair well with rich, creamy foods.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Delicate scents suggesting aromatic herb, citrus blossom and a whiff of orchard fruit come together on this. The palate is round but rather shy, offering notes of mature yellow apple, honey and bitter almond.",Italy-Tuscany-Vernaccia
"Aromas of spiced tomato, clove and rubber gloves don't click or suggest much quality. A cloying, sugary palate with mucky berry flavors is less than stellar, as is a sticky finish that tastes like strawberry jam.",Chile-Central Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of stewed fruit, prune and toast lead the nose. The firm palate is still rather closed but reveals dried black cherry, fig, black pepper, clove and coffee alongside astringent, grainy tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This is an impressive wine from a new producer. It's aromatically expressive in notes of ripe apple, star fruit and pear, with lemon-pith accents. The melon and citrus flavors are rounded, fresh and clean, offering a great balance of acidity.",US-Washington-Grenache Blanc
"A darkly colored red blend that tastes like coffee sweetened with blackberry liqueur and anise. It's a big, rich, thick wine that's rustic, but entirely drinkable with barbecue, burgers, pizza.",US-California-Red Blend
"Subdued aromas of jasmine, hawthorn and citrus lead the nose. The sunny palate offers yellow peach, pineapple and a hint of toasted almond alongside restrained acidity.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Vermentino
"With no oak influence, this Cabernet Franc is chock full of pristine raspberry and cherry notes. It's quite concentrated on the palate with deep, ripe red-fruit flavor, but marked by tart cranberry acidity and a long, lingering finish and just a hint of leafy green notes.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"Roasted, murky and earthy up front, with almost no fruit aromas to latch onto, this breaks up on the palate due to sketchy structure. Saucy, herbal, salty berry flavors finish briny and roasted.",Chile-Maule Valley-Carmenère
"Ripe and structured, this full-bodied red opens with alluring scents of star anise, dark-skinned berry, underbrush, leather and a balsamic note. On the juicy palate, menthol, licorice and baking spice accent a core of black cherry. Noble tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018–2023.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This slender, barely-there wine offers almost weightless lightness, fresh citrus notes and a soft finish of lime zest. It delivers simple, clean refreshment.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"Here's a fleshy, well-proportioned Chianti Classico with bright, jammy notes of cherry and blackberry backed by softer aromas of vanilla and spice. Smooth roundness is capped by firm structure.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"The fact that there is 60% Cabernet Franc in this blend gives the wine a real perfumed attractiveness. It is fruity and light, with a crisp lively character. Red berries and plenty of acidity leave a fresh aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"Gris Pinot Grigio Gris offers a sultry, sophisticated side to what is normally perceived as an easy-drinking white wine variety. This wine opens with aromas of peach, pineapple, white almond and honey. It follows to the mouth with a rich, creamy texture.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"This ripe, all-fruit wine tastes unoaked because a lush blend of apple, peach and pear crowds the aromas, and more of the same fruitiness expands in the flavors. The mouthfeel is especially gentle, and the finish almost sweet.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Big-hearted fruit dominates this smooth wine. The estate, owned by the Tesseron family and close to their other property of Pontet-Canet, is performing well and it shows in this juicy ripe wine, full of generous tannins. The aftertaste shows both acidity and concentration. Drink from 2022.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a tough wine, filled with tannins and missing out on the fruit. Its structure is powerful, dark and dry, packing a punch of the hard texture. There is some juicy fruit, although it is not likely to ever soften the wine completely.",Portugal-Alentejo-Portuguese Red
"A wine that is soft, fragrant and very fruity. There's a touch of spice, pepper as well as tangy lemon zest. Sandgrube 13 is the address of the Krems cooperative. Screwcap.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"This is a red-fruit flavored wine, soft and warm. The wood aging shows as smooth vanilla that balances the soft, open, generous structure. It's a juicy wine that can be enjoyed now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Three vintages into this project, and it seems like Arte de Vivir has found its stride. At this price, finding a good Ribera wine is akin to the proverbial needle in the haystack; so seek out this meaty, ripe number and dig into its plum and berry body that's backed by vanilla, coconut and good tannic structure.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"While the aromas show some promise, they are disappointingly faint for a Gewürztraminer. This wine is an easy quaffer but lacks the palate richness typical of this variety. Crisp acidity and low alcohol (11.7%) make it a good hot weather choice.",US-New York-Gewürztraminer
"A lighter, tightly wound take on the grape, with boysenberry, black pepper and a smoky pork umami character slowly emerging on the nose, this fresh wine will last a while. The even-handed palate shows vanilla and blueberry notes, steadily solving toward a savory though crisp finish.",US-California-Syrah
"This structured, generously full-bodied wine offers deep layers of black raspberry and cinnamon, with an additional length of subtle black pepper and leather. It builds strength toward the finish before finishing surprisingly light and balanced.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Soft and ripe, with fruit flavors that border on raisin and prune, this nicely bottle-aged Merlot is good to go right now. In fact, it could pass for an older wine, or perhaps a nonvintage blend; it's smooth and mature, with good balance and very soft tannins.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Beautifully concentrated and rich, this wine is so dense with black fruit and dark-chocolate flavors that it's almost chewy. Blended from nine grape varieties, it has a wealth of fine-grained tannins and feels velvety in texture, while the powerful, layered flavors linger on the finish.",US-California-Red Blend
"Ripe yellow pear is held in check by citrus zestiness, but rich fruit notions keep breaking though the bracing freshness of this wine. A slender body and fine-tuned phenolics add to the appeal of this balanced white.",Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
"Swathes of bramble, dried herb and toast meander enticingly through this elegant but slightly savory Bordeaux-style blend. Crisp black-cherry and berry flavors are taut and restrained, augmented with refreshing acidity and persistent but fine tannins.",US-New York-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The Tain cooperative's luxury cuvée of Crozes-Hermitage is marked by touches of vanilla and cedar, yet retains some sinewy herbal notes and ample black cherry fruit. It's medium-bodied, well structured and firm, even a bit crisp, on the finish. It's modern and oak-influenced, but well done.",France-Rhône Valley-Syrah
"Buttery and richly oaked, with some apple and pear flavors underneath, this wine is okay—if you're okay with oaky wines. Finishes with a torrent of vanilla flavors.",Italy-Veneto-White Blend
"This is too oaky, with vanilla, buttered toast and butterscotch notes dominating the underlying pineapple and guava flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A 10 month stint in oak has given this rich wine a seriously spicy character supported by dark chocolate and black fruit flavors. Syrah, Castelão and Cabernet Sauvignon give this young wine tannins and a dark texture that needs to soften. Drink after 2016.",Portugal-Península de Setúbal-Portuguese Red
"Ripe Williams pear with grapefruit overtones segues into a creamy, almost buttery rounded palate that nonetheless has the tautness and verve of pure citrus zest. There are mellower tones here, too, of wet earth, pear juice and balm. This shows impressive elegance, length and personality. Drink now until 2025.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"A charred, toasty oak imprint makes way for gunpowder, cedar and pencil in this lush, savory wine, complexly built with wrap-around tannins. Cedar and herb provide a classical component amidst black licorice and coffee.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Quite a solid wine for less than $20, this bottling shows yellow apple, nectarine, peach blossom, sea salt, lemon and a touch of slate on the nose. Buttered-pear flavors show on the fleshy palate, with lemon zest, white peach, more sea salt and hints of nuts and vanilla.",US-California-Chardonnay
Perfumed spice aromas give this wine its toasty character. The wood aging dominates the fruit. The fruit is ripe and will develop. Give this wine until 2024.,France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This is easy to like for its clean, brisk mouthfeel, creaminess and slightly sweet flavors of lime and strawberry. Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it shows real finesse.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"This blend of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino, 8% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Sauvignon offers aromas of underbrush, espresso, mocha and blackberry. On the palate, coffee and vanilla notes back up ripe plum, black cherry and white pepper. Firm, tightly knit tannins give structure but needs time to soften and unwind.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"Black as a moonless night, dense in structure, tannic, bone dry and super-peppery, this Syrah isn't offering much relief right now. In all likelihood it will emerge from its cocoon in a few years to offer a wealth of ripe blackberry, currant and carob fruit.",US-California-Syrah
"This is a full-bodied and intensely fruity wine with jammy aromas and ripe cherry and raspberry flavors. It is smooth textured and has soft tannins, so the effect is easygoing in spite of high alcohol.",US-California-Zinfandel
"For some reason, the winery held the '06 back later than the 2007. Maybe because it was so tannic. Still is, with a biting, palate-shutting astringency made harder by the wine's extreme dryness. But there's a place for tannic, dry Syrahs, and this is a very good one, with precisely measured oak framing deep, impressive blackberry, leather and black pepper flavors.",US-California-Syrah
"A darker, quite savory expression of Black Kite's entire vineyard site in the Deep End of Anderson Valley, this Pinot imparts a touch of cardamom spice and high acidity, with a dryness to the finish that gets a lift from that acid at the end.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This high-end wine has a tenacious hold of earthiness, that exhibits as tomato leaf and dried herb. Full-bodied and densely concentrated, its tannins are smooth and fine, while the texture leans gravelly. Black pepper and leather characteristics are hard to ignore.",US-California-Merlot
"The ripe, spicy strawberry and orange fruitiness of this wine is immediately attractive. It has lively acidity within a rich framework. Drink this refreshing wine now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Rosé
"This perfumed wine offers plenty (perhaps too much) acidity and red fruits, with only light tannins. That makes for a fruity wine, fresh and ready to drink now and until 2018.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This gorgeous wine bursts open with loads of ripe fruit, blackberry, tar, asphalt and pipe tobacco. It's a thick, velvety expression with a high caliber of concentration and intensity that would pair with roast lamb or barbecue pork chops. Age 5–7 more years.",Italy-Central Italy-Montepulciano
"This lovely Montalcino estate delivers a bright, ruby-colored Rosso that is heavily characterized by fresh forest-fruit aromas and bright acids. The wine is streamlined and pristine.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"There's a lot of complex, youthful charm in this Cabernet-based wine, which was grown in both of St. Supery's estate vineyards, Rutherford and Dollarhide. It's very rich and ripe in blackberries, cassis, blueberries and dark chocolate, with a savory spiciness. This really defines the Napa style, and demonstrates the great success of the 2007 vintage.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Among all the 2011 single vineyard Pinots from Ken Wright, the Carter was the most difficult to assess. It showed reductive scents and remained stubbornly closed despite all efforts to give it a chance to open. Tight cranberry and cherry fruit peeked through a hard shell.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This is the winery's first Petit Verdot, and it's a beauty. Firm and muscular, it has plenty of blackberry and black cherry flavors hanging on its tannic bones. The finish shows a smack of dark chocolate, and the overall structure suggests that this will age for 15 years or more.",US-Washington-Petit Verdot
"Everything here is just hinted at: a touch of tropical fruit on the nose, a faint note of nougat on the palate and a spritz of lemon over the biscuity backdrop. There is structure, dryness and backbone, all held in a tight package that has a long-echoing aftertaste.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"Fruit salad aromas, simple apple and pear flavors and a soft texture add up to a pleasant wine. Light bodied, and balanced away from crispness, it is still enjoyable and refreshing.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Dry and hot, with a brittle feeling in the mouth, like chewing on plastic wrap. Shows Lifesaver candy flavors of sour cherries, oranges and raspberries, finished with a hit of tart acidity. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
Ripe orange and plump stone fruits rise from the glass while subtle rose scents hover. The palate is fresh. There is enough acidity and a slightly bitter phenolic edge to frame the peach and orange fruit that is augmented by a little residual sweetness. The finish is off dry. Drink while flavors are fresh.,France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"This vintage of Tenuta di Trinoro's renowned super Tuscan (mostly Merlot with some Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Canernet Sauvignon) is a tad too ripe and mature to score higher. Bold notes of strawberry and blackberry preserves rob the wine of some of its inherent elegance and add a chewy, sticky element to its mouthfeel. Otherwise, you'll get bold tones of tobacco, leather and spice.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This fine and elegant Brunello is accented by plush softness and bright flavors of wild berry, raspberry and sweet almond paste. Thicker tones of espresso and chocolate appear on the close and are carried forth by the wine's velvety richness.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso

"From old vines in a tree-enclosed vineyard on the third terrace above the River Lot, this wine forms part of a range of wines featuring the soils and terraces of the Cahors vineyard. Named in homage to Marguerite de Massaut, a 16th-century owner of the estate, the wine is aged in new wood that gives it a minty character. That is balanced by the rich black-plum and truffle flavor and the intense acidity. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2021.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"There's a lovely sweetness to the fruit, which tastes like ripe, just-picked blackberries. Old vines, 100+ years, deliver sweet, supple, sexy fruit. The wine has very dry tannins, and it might profit from some blending, but with a vineyard this special you have to admire the single-vineyard approach.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A spicy, perfumed blend of Encruzado with Malvasia and Gouveio, the wine comes from 35-year-old vines, simply fermented in stainless steel. It is ripe, packed with fruit and delicious to drink.",Portugal-Dão-Portuguese White
"It's sad that only 5,080 bottles of this wine were produced, as it's truly a stunner. Dark and developed, complex and concentrated, this wine exhibits such superb balance and finesse, with nuanced notes of minerality, scrubland, whole tobacco leaf, black pepper and licorice root all gracing the dark fruit core of the nose and mouth. It's lush and full on the palate, and medium tannins provide a solid structure, making the wine drinkable now or ready to age.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Fragrant and fresh, this structured wine offers aromas of baking spice, woodland berry and a balsamic note. The aromas follow through to the palate, along with sour cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and clove. Solid tannins and fresh acidity provide the backbone.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A medium-weight contender whose fruit struggles to be acknowledged above the oak. There are some dark cherry and cocoa notes, especially on the nose, but in the end the oak rules, through the toasty, medium-length finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Principally Syrah, this includes 15% Grenache and 3% Mourvèdre. Rich and complex, supple and subtle, the mix of red, blue and purple fruits is potent, but also brings a welcome wash of wet stone and a dash of pepper. The focus and intensity are exemplary.",US-Washington-G-S-M
"This is a fruity wine, packed with acidity, red fruits and a soft texture. With its crisp open character it is not a wine for long aging, so drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of baked plum, vanilla, raisin and a confectionary note emerge in the glass. On the palate, notes of ground black pepper and chocolate accent the core of black cherry and raspberry compote alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"This is a pronounced wine, boasting upfront aromas of blackberry, plum and boysenberry that are graced with additional scents of licorice, chicory, black pepper and crushed violet. The palate is bold, with a gripping texture that supports the lush black-fruit flavors. Toasted oak and sweet smoke accents grace the medium-length finish. Drink now–2020.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Pinotage
"A 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this offers aromas of underbrush, cedar, bluish-black fruit, spice and a whiff of scorched earth. On the palate, notes of licorice, tobacco, grilled herbs and menthol accent black currant and dried black cherry. Bracing, raspy tannins provide the framework.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Easy-drinking and varietal, this displays fresh pear fruit cut with pineapple. It's forward and juicy, a wine to drink chilled with picnic foods.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"It's old-gold color says it all. This luscious, liquorous wine has a tangy edge to go alongside the acidity, the raisin fruits and flavors of long wood aging. It's not so much fresh as still very alive and poised. Drink now.",Portugal-Port-Port
"A very herbaceous, fish-friendly wine that wins with its lemon and pink grapefruit flavors. It's aromatic and light, with the fruitiness right up front. Screwcap.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Wiry, herbal aromas of raspberry and plum are slightly stalky. This feels tight, choppy and prickly, but also alert and racy. Flavors of herbal raspberry and plum finish with additional herbal notes, a touch of chocolate and snappy acids.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"With a dark color and full body, this dry, tannic wine is useful at the table with big roasts, barbecue and rich beef and game stews. It has grapy, earthy flavors of blackberries, black licorice and black pepper.",US-California-Red Blend
"This is a light-bodied, very fruity and soft-textured wine that smells like cherries, berries and melons and tastes fresh and a touch sweet. The acidity is low and the bubbles are lively, so it's easy to sip.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Dense and delicious, this opens with aromas of plum cake, tobacco, leather and blackberry. The rich palate delivers crushed black raspberry, mocha and chocolate alongside brooding tannins. Give it time to unwind and fully develop.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Far richer and more concentrated than the winery's regular '05 Pinot, this is a true reserve. It shows the same dryness and silky texture, but the spicy fruit is more intense in cherries and black raspberries, veering into cassis and anisette. Drink now for its extravagent flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine is ripe and packed with yellow-fruit flavors. It is smooth with a touch of butteriness. This is ready to drink, rich with bright acidity at the end.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Rich, lusty aromas of blackberry, graham cracker and coconut are hard-driving in this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot. It's oaky and full of coconut, vanilla, blackberry and toasted marshmallow flavors. Ripe and oaky on the finish, it also offers coffee, mocha and chocolate notes. Drink through 2020.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"This is 89% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot and 3% Syrah. It's toasty to the max, with scents and flavors of coffee and smoke as much as berry and cassis. There is great acid/tannin balance and some additional years of bottle age should help to bring out more of the fruit.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Deep and dense, this smells horsey and leathery, with aromas of earthy berries. The palate feels racy with acidity, and the flavors of berry, cassis, cola and vanilla lead to a sweet, jammy finish, with touches of vanilla and caramel.",Argentina-Other-Red Blend
"Pretty in floral spiciness, this wine is a worthy continuation from the previous vintage, leathery and restrained, more soft red and blue fruit than burly black. Smooth and earthy, the finish is lingering. This food-friendly Petite Sirah is ready to enjoy now with a hearty roast.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"This is a heavily oaked Carmenère, so aromas of caramel, vanilla and licorice share space on the bouquet with stewed, foresty notes. Plump and saturated in feel, this is more mellow and soft than tough or tannic. Roasted blackberry, toast and spicy oak flavors end big and heavily, with leftover oak and herbal notes. Drink through 2018.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"Creamy and textural, this brings on a nice mix of apple, pear and Key lime fruit flavors, fresh and pretty. Just a hint of minerality adds interest to the finish.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"An immediately attractive, quaffable wine with clean, fresh flavors. This is a light, fresh wine designed to go with summer foods.",Italy-Veneto-White Blend

"This is the inaugural release of this wine, which is composed of fruit from Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills vineyards. It's aromatically generous, with appealing notes of sage, dried herb, cassis, dark chocolate, spice, pencil lead and dark fruit. The palate delivers a mouthful of dark-fruit flavors and tannins that are combined to a fine sheen. It shows a beautiful sense of balance capped off by a persistent finish. It drinks well now but is made with the future in mind.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"L'Ecole's Columbia Valley Cabernet is again 100% varietal; the blending magic comes from a mix of excellent vineyards. This is a classy, classic wine, with pinpoint structure and spot-on varietal character. The compact palate is packed with details, and though it's drinking well, it is clearly a wine to cellar for a while longer. Notes of clean earth, clover, herb and light chocolate add depth to a core of black cherry and cassis.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"An easy to drink Pinot for its dryness, exceptionally low alcohol, and cleansing acidity. It has cherry, red plum, cola and herb flavors, framed with sweet, smoky sandalwood. Decant for a while.",US-California-Pinot Noir

The dry edge gives the wine concentration, while the finish brings out black-currant acidity. Drink this fine wine from 2018.",France-Southwest France-Tannat-Cabernet
"This bottling from Brack Mountain Wine Company shows butter, sea salt and caramel on the nose, balanced by tangerine and faint jasmine aromas. The wine is elegant and easy to like, with Meyer lemon and prominent-but-not- overpowering honey butter on the palate, and a pink lemonade touch that carries into the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This wine is a unique in the state blend and features Cinsault (35%), Grenache (35%) and Mourvèdre.

It's a perfect summer wine.",US-Washington-Rosé
"Aromas of French oak, pressed rose, wild berry, mint, new leather and a whiff of truffle slowly unfold in the glass. The lean, evolved palate offers dried black cherry, espresso and toasted oak alongside drying, fleeting tannins that leave an astringent finish. Drink sooner rather than later to catch the remaining fruit.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Rich, dry and tannic, this Syrah has elaborate flavors of dried plums, blackberries, coffee, dark bitter chocolate and black pepper. It's a complex wine, compromised only by the heat of 15.4% alcohol.",US-California-Syrah
"Charred blackberries and deep caramel notes make up the nose of this wine named after the cellar master. Medium in feel, the palate shows a decent roundness, however racing acids cut the midpalate short. Additional black fruit carry the flavors, with black pepper marking the finish.",US-Virginia-Petit Verdot
"This cuvée is the product of a collaboration between Phelps Creek owner Bob Morus and Burgundian winemaker Alexandrine Roy. She has crafted an elegant wine with unusual nuances—hints of bacon fat and butter, lightly woven into the tart, racy pomegranate and raspberry fruit. Elegant and refined, this is as Burgundian as Oregon Pinot ever gets.",US-Oregon-Red Blend
"This grabs attention quickly, with a dark color and potent jam and brown sugar aromas. Next come dazzling strawberry syrup flavors backed by thick tannins and good acidity. The texture is astringent and tight, but the flavors are so full that they meet the tannins half way. Best now through 2019.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This wine is a blend of 60% Syrah from Funk Estate in The Rocks and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon from McClellan Estate. It draws you into the glass with aromas of plum, coffee, huckleberry, black olive and light spices. The feel—plush and palate-coating—is the real star of the show, with persistent blue fruit and coffee flavors on the finish.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"A fine, ripe and soft blend of Duras and Braucol, this is a wine that's made to drink young for its fruit. There is a dry background to the fruitiness although it is the red-fruit flavors and balanced acidity that shine. Drink from early 2018.",France-Southwest France-Red Blend
"This is a Cabernet-dominated Bordeaux blend from a variety of well-respected Yakima Valley vineyards. Despite a little sweatiness in the nose, the wine has some sleek, racy berry flavored fruit. It shows only moderate concentration in the midpalate, with juicy acids and firm tannins. The finish turns watery, a bit dilute, with raspberry and pale red currant notes.",US-Washington-Red Blend

"An elegant, compelling Chardonnay, its fruit accented with lemon, honey and lime. Low cropping of Dijon clone 76 has concentrated the flavors (and the alcohol—a surprising 15.7%) without turning the wine into an overblown fat boy. Nuanced and long, it is one of the most satisfying Chardonnays to come out of Oregon in recent memory.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Echoes of that typical Grüner pepperiness can be divined on nose and palate. Even if this is very light, it offers clean fruit, citrus verve and refreshing zip.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"Soft herbal berry aromas are minty and green. The palate on this young but raisiny Cabernet has a jammy cushion to it, while flavors of green bean, herbs and carob are not distinguished. A creamy feeling but tannic finish is chewy, chunky and weighty.",Argentina-Other-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Enticing oak spices in the aromas and deftly blended fruit, spice and mineral flavors make this wine especially appealing. It's medium bodied, not a monster, and combines ripe black-cherry flavors, moderate tannins, muted acidity and a velvety mouthfeel.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Here's a gorgeous Fiano that portrays the variety's natural fruitiness and structure very well. You'll get melon, pear and honey and the wine tastes chewy and creamy in the mouth. If you don't already know this terrific grape from southern Italy, here is a great introduction to the variety.",Italy-Southern Italy-Fiano
"Still young, this wine has a tight character that needs to open up. Since there is plenty of fruit along with perfumed acidity, it will happen. Tannins and a bitter edge need to be softened, so wait until late 2016 for this wine's potential to really show.",France-Loire Valley-Pinot Noir
"Very light in color, this wine brings appealing aromas of white pepper, smoked meat, orange peel, herb, earth and sauvage. The palate is ethereally light and delicate, showing pleasing nuances, with plenty of floral flavors on the finish.",US-Washington-Grenache

Age for 4–5 years at least.",Austria-Kamptal-Riesling

"Baked mulberry, black cherry and brown spice lead into more nuanced notes of iron, turned earth and carpaccio meatiness on the nose of this blended bottling by Rick Longoria. Dark red-fruit flavors show on the sip, framed by a tannic tension that will steadily reveal more elements in years to come.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Firm cherry and plum aromas filter into a bright, elegant, lifted palate with freshening acidity and body to match. Juicy, lightly spiced core flavors of plum and red currant are draped with a fine oak flavor, and the finish is light, dry, focused and shows modest residual barrel notes.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Pinot Noir

"This certified organic and biodynamic wine has no sulfites added. It offers deep color plus bold black cherry and smoke aromas.

"This brawny wine opens with aromas that recall resin, nail polish remover, prune and nutmeg. The warm, monolithic palate offers dried black fruit steeped in spirits, raisin and licorice alongside assertive tannins. The burn of evident alcohol and lack of fruit richness throws it off balance.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Named after the Laroche winery, L'Obédiencerie, this wine is a selection from the Blanchots Grand Cru vineyard. It is rich, but endowed with a taut minerality that cuts through the ripe green plum and crisp pear flavors. It demands aging. Drink from 2020.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"An enormous Pinot Noir that's rich and ripe in cherries, red currants, licorice, cola and sweet toasty oak, and thoroughly dry on the finish. There's no doubting its layers of complexity, although it's a little warm with alcohol. Could be an ager. Try after 2016.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is quite light and lemony, closer to an Italian Pinot Grigio than to an Oregon Pinot Gris. What it lacks in flesh it compensates for in freshness and vitality; the subtle fruit flavors suggest Asian pear, jicama and cucumber. It would be a lovely match for a light fish such as rainbow trout or Dover sole.",US-Washington-Pinot Gris
"The aromas are bright, with notes of pear, melon and apple. The palate brings dry ale flavors that taper toward the finish.",US-Washington-Grenache Blanc
"A very complete wine, firm but flattering on the palate. A mix of cherry skins, red plums and lovely juiciness all come together in an harmonious whole.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay

"Rich and honeyed on the nose and palate, this is chock-full of superripe tropical fruit notes, spiked with hints of white truffle, black tea and sweet brioche. It's an interesting mélange of yumminess, but there's just a hint of something chemical on the nose and palate that distracts.",US-New York-Vidal Blanc
"Delicate alluring scents suggesting ripe orchard fruit and Spanish broom lead the nose on this subtle elegant white. On the bright balanced palate, notes of beeswax and mineral underscore Bartlett pear and yellow apple. It boasts impressive harmony and freshness for what was an extremely hot vintage.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Juicy in blackberry and dark plum, this is a fruity Primitivo with a backbone of leather, coffee and spice. The finish veers into overripe flavors.",US-California-Primitivo
"This screaming vintage of Secreto is the living definition of pungency. Immediately it hits with fierce gooseberry and nettle aromas along with passion fruit and grapefruit.

"This wine has a great future, offering good acidity, crisp fruitiness and a tangy aftertaste. But in six months it will reveal a richer yellow fruits that will give it a rounded, ripe character. Wait until 2017.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This simplest, freshest and lightest of Chablis styles has a refreshing lemon character, a light touch of melon and crisp acidity. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"This wine's aromas of melon and citrus don't seem entirely varietal. Still, it brings plenty of appeal with zippy, elegant flavors that linger.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"A darker shade of yellow in the glass, this bottling from an Alban clone turns out to be a lighter, more delicate take on Roussanne. Touches of saffron, wax and toasted nuts show on the nose, and that light nutty character does extend to the sip. But the palate also offers apricot and lemon rinds against well measured acidity and a compelling minerality that combines white rocks and hot sand flavors.",US-California-Roussanne
"An unusual Zinfandel, with 10% Cabernet Franc mixed in, American Legend is from Frank Gunther's Vineyard in California's Shenandoah Valley (the Zin is anyway; the Cab Franc is estate). Smooth with a background of smoky berry flavor, it suggests sweet tarts mid-palate, and a taste of chocolatey vanilla on the finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This is made using a selection of fruit that's sourced from both banks of the Serein River. It's a properly crisp Chardonnay, and it offers a white fruit flavor and a bright, lively finish.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"From a consistently top-notch estate, this single vineyard Pinot offers lifted red fruits, florals, as well as cinnamon and star anise thanks to the use of some whole bunch fermentation in the winemaking process.

"Another big, dense expression of the vintage, this has a softness to the tannins that makes it accessible, though the wine will benefit from time in the cellar, through 2017. Cinnamon and clove intermingle with black cherry and currant, finishing in a hint of tobacco.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Vinified with 50% whole clusters, this pure Pommard selection is from the highest portion of the vineyard. This seems to bring slightly more definition to the wine, which puts a tangy undercoating around the bright berry flavors. There's a pleasant lick of chocolate running through the tail.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"It's like Christmas in a glass the way the aromas on this wine settle keenly on pine and sugar plum. Earthy with a touch of dried herb, the wine's mouthfeel is velvety with a kick, the body full-figured in blackberry intensity, with the whole wrapped in substantial oak. The weight and firmness suggest cellaring, through 2017.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Especially rich and complex in this outstanding vintage, this brings bright and deeply flavored cherry fruit front and center. There's a streak of chocolate and a whiff of composted earth—not too much. As the wine lingers through its finish, the luscious fruit impresses the most.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"Hints of flinty smoke precede notes of ripe pear fruit on the nose. The palate comes with an unusually light-footed, almost fleeting transparency.

There are hints of almond and gingerbread spice that frame this lovely, slender, dry and spicy Pinot Gris with its clean finish.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"A blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Cabernet Franc from a sweet vineyard spot near Dalle Valle, this is a lovely, softly textured wine. Shy on the nose yet powerful on the palate, it offers a burst of tightly wound tannin and leather at the fore. Chocolate and dried herb with a layering of black licorice give it a dark complexion and build. Be sure to mellow it in the cellar, through 2022.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Plump aromas of black cherry, mulberry, vanilla and star anise rise on the rich but not overbearing nose of this wine. There is dark-fruit ripeness on the front, but then comes a heavy array of spices, from allspice and clove to thyme and dried sage. The texture is soft, yet the tannins are noticeable and the acidity is buoyant.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Earthy mushroom, yeast and spice notes accent aromas of preserved red fruits on this exuberantly foamy sparkler. It's penetrating on the palate with tart cranberry acidity, and finishes with a lingering hint of dried leaves.",US-New York-Pinot Noir
"Blue fruit and high acidity open this delightful Pinot Noir, from a cool section of the Russian River Valley overlapping Green Valley. The oak imprint is low, yet the wine offers firm structure and elegance, remaining subdued and fresh on the palate in swirls of dark cherry, boysenberry and earthy leather.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"There's a touch of reduction on the nose of this wine, which otherwise offers a nutty profile that's somewhat shut down. Oaky and smoky, it has a bit of minty chocolate on the thick, full-bodied palate.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Now mature, this is a softly fruity wine, its cherry and black currant fruits attractive rounded out by the gentle tannins. There is a dry core that comes with touches of wood and acidity. Not for aging.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Light and steely, this wine offers mild flavors that lean tropical, like pineapple and guava. Those succulently ripe layers meet stone fruit and a medium-sized body, making for an enjoyable, food-friendly experience on the palate.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Not as deeply purple as other Syrahs, this bottling shows more broad red-fruit aromas of caramelized cherry along with lilacs, violets, crushed black rocks and vanilla cola. Mulberry, dark strawberry and plum elements bring intrigue to the palate, which also offers savory black sesame and hoisin notes.",US-California-Syrah
"This Bordeaux-style blend of 40% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Franc and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon offers a trio of plum, leather and char aromas. Although the wine feels slack and broad on entrance, the fine tannins strike on the midpalate, which gives it a sense of muscularity. A black raspberry note surfaces on the bright finish.",US-Virginia-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The wine seems hollow, showing structure without fruit weight. Very dry and extracted, it is likely to remain hard.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Very mineral in character, this wine is named after a former priest of Dürnstein who renovated the village church. It is certainly ripe, while very textured and chalky in character, with its acidity whirling around the glass. There's great concentration as well, beautifully smoothed out by the spice and crisp apple balance. Screwcap. Artisanal Cellars, Select Wines.",Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
"Drying, dusty white stone characterizes the nose of this luminous sparkler, which is informal and fun and perfect as an aperitif. The wine segues into creamy peach, backed by thick, frosty foam.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"From the historic Uvas Creek area between Gilroy and Morgan Hill comes this solid bottling that shows black cherry, leather, dust and a slightly green element of oregano and green peppercorns on the nose. The palate is restrained and herbaceous, with elderberry fruit and woody sagebrush flavors.",US-California-Meritage
"Light hints of herbs and fynbos add character to the green melon, plum and grapefruit pith aromas. The palate follows with more of the same, in addition to accents of green plantain and lime leaf. This is direct and lifted, with a clean, brisk finish. Enjoy now.",South Africa-Western Cape-Sauvignon Blanc
"Big and bold, this is a structured, dark wine. Its wood aging still shows, although this will integrate. It will be a powerful, rich wine, dense and with dark tannins. Drink from 2020.",Portugal-Douro-Touriga Nacional
"An impressive young Cabernet from a region not well known for Cabs. The first impression is a complex aroma of herb, dark cherry and dark chocolate that continues through to the palate. The texture is laced well with fine, firm tannins that will make it great with rich meat and cheese dishes. Overall it is concentrated and full-bodied, big but balanced.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Hard to tell the difference between this wine and a Pinot Noir. It's silky, brisk and lightly tannic, with savory raspberry jam, cola, sautéed mushroom and spice flavors. Drink over the next few years for freshness.",US-California-Pinot Meunier
"Aromas of wisteria and green apple lead the way on this straightforward white. The tangy palate tastes of juicy pear, citrus and a hint of white almond while zesty acidity and a mineral note give the finish a slight lift.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"This juicy middleweight is well-integrated in terms of oak and ripeness. Salty lime and pear interplay on the palate, finishing crisp and clean.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Made entirely with Sangiovese, it has aromas of ripe black fruit, tilled earth, toasted oak sweet vanilla and a hint of leather. The rich palate offers toasted oak, black berries, espresso and coffee alongside dusty, drying tannins",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Dry, crisp and fruity, this has a light texture, with flavors of crisp grapefruit and green apple. It's intense, bright and fragrant, with its acidity and fruitiness pushing forward.",France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"Equal parts Heart of the Hill and Red Heaven fruit, this wine opens with barrel aromas of vanilla and shaved coconut in front of dark fruit. The flavors are full in feel but retain a sense of elegance, with cranberry and vanilla flavors intertwining on the finish. The barrel notes are quite prominent but overall it works.",US-Washington-Mourvèdre
"From hillside vineyards, here's a concentrated, intense wine with some tongue-sticking tannins. Blackberry, espresso and white-pepper aromas lead to a round, full-bodied and very dry wine that will benefit from a year or so of cellaring.",US-California-Syrah
"This fine, rich, fruity wine is from a chateau controlled by the Lurton family. It is solid, concentrated and dense, packed with blackberry flavor. Deliciously juicy now, it has the tannins and acidity that suggest it is capable of aging for many years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Just 730 cases were made of this dry, lightly fruity offering. Melon and white peach flavors seem to be dusted with powdered sugar, though there is no sweetness in the finish, just dry flavors of wet stone. A good, every day, all-purpose white.",US-Washington-Pinot Grigio
"Vegetal-leaning aromas of beans, peas and squash lead to a round somewhat flabby palate. Green, herbal flavors crowd out mild citrus and melon notes in front of a low-acid soft finish.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Concentrated and slightly earthy, this has more density and grip (as it should) than the C.M.S. red, but a similar profile (51% Merlot, 38% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Cabernet Franc and 4% Syrah.) Black cherry and plum fruits are wrapped in light smoke and mocha flavors. The fruit-driven coregently leads into soft, silky tannins that leave an impression of black olive at the end of a lingering finish.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Good structure on this wine, with fine acidity providing clean balance. It sure is fruity, though, with massive pineapple, peach, apple and smoky oak flavors that could use a bit more finesse and subtlety.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A slightly heady, volatile touch plays on the nose. The palate is fresh with lemon and zest but also has rounded buttery notes on its concentrated yet light body. A very intriguing dry Riesling that still needs to come into its own. Its dry lightness is a boon. Drink 2020–2025.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Perfumed in cinnamon-flowery aromatics, this well-valued Zin is softly spiced, lush and smooth, drinkable with black cherry flavor and plenty of personality.",US-California-Zinfandel

"The black pepper and cocoa flavors that always mark this fine vineyard show up again in this dry, tannic wine. So do the blackberries and cassis that make it so sweetly fruity. The acidity is awkward, though, and tastes like it was added to balance out a high alcohol wine.",US-California-Syrah
"A light, clear color suggests a lighthearted wine, but this coastal vineyard-designate delivers plenty of power around a core of damp, earthy wild strawberry and blackberry. Soft, with managed and integrated tannins, it's relatively high in acidity and is well structured, with a pleasant jamminess and aromas of freshly cut rose.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"There is building excitement around this grape, popular in California 100 years ago and often coming from old vines today. Aromas of caramel, baked plum and crushed brown spice show on the nose, while the palate offers darker touches of espresso, dark chocolate, elderberry, plum skins, pulverized blackberry, black pepper and cedar on the finish.",US-California-Carignane
"While there is an initial barnyard edge, once that blows off, it reveals a dense and solid wine, packed with ripe black fruit and sweet tannins. The acidity brings out spice and edgy, mineral characters.",Portugal-Port-Port
"It might seem odd to plant Syrah in the heart of Pinot Noir country, but it's one of the mysterious charms of the Northwest, where Riesling and Cabernet can also grow successfully side by side. This wine has deep color, excellent balance, true varietal expression, and seductive hints of smoke, cured meat, and a salty tang. Purple berry flavors are just ripe enough; it's an elegant, restrained style, suggesting that the Willamette Valley can put a unique stamp on this grape.",US-Oregon-Syrah
"About a third of this is Bien Nacido Vineyard (Santa Barbara) fruit; the rest comes from Sonoma. Plenty of cedar, earth and some cherry-tomato flavors in this fruit-forward wine. Strawberry preserves and that darn hint of tomato extend into the finish, along with a fair bit of tannin.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A small percentage of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon is added to this Sangiovese-based wine to add structure and softness. As a consequence, the nose is attractively redolent of sweet cherry, clove, toasted almond, espresso and new leather.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Deep smells of sagebrush, cherry and herbed mushroom sauce lead the nose in Adam Lee's take on Rosella's Vineyard. The wine is rich and soft on the palate, with sour cherry, roasted tomatoes and a slightly bitter, tannic finish framed by espresso. Serve with thinly sliced roasted beef.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Both mineral and herbaceous, this is a crisp, taut and textured wine. It shows a tangy character, lemon zest and bright acidity. It's still too young, so drink from the end of 2015.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"The ripe, appetizing zestiness of Amalfi lemon peel, paired with a green streak of lime and herb conquers nose and palate immediately. The palate brings out more lime freshness on a very linear, concentrated and taut palate. Both deliciously bracing and wonderfully refreshing.",Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
"This is a good, everyday Pinot that's rich and sweet in berries and cherries, with plenty of oak to give it that buttered toast and vanilla deliciousness. Enjoy it now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Full of new wood and tannic flavors, this is dense, dry, very firm. It does suffer from some licorice overextraction that gives the wine a bitter edge. At the same time, the wine has a full and firm character that promises a softening over the next several years.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Complex and slightly austere flavors like rhubarb, clove and black tea lend complexity to this nicely tight, dry and well-balanced wine. The texture is firm due to good acidity and lightly gripping tannins, but the rich flavors soak through them for a lingering finish. It will be best after 2020.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The aromas pop on this 100% varietal, with notes of dark plum, mountain blueberry, vanilla and cream. The flavors are smooth and sultry, mixing fruit and barrel with a plush feel and a lightly astringent finish. The variety is hard to get but it delivers a lot of enjoyment.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"Round and ripe tropical fruit mark this solid and affordable Chardonnay. Interesting shadings of lime, clove and other spices keep it engaging on the palate. Ends with a medium- length finish of sweet-tart pineapple fruit.",Australia-New South Wales-Chardonnay
"Leather and citrus aromas unleash a mild chemical note on the nose of this Monastrell-Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon blend. A solid palate with hard, poking tannins leads to cherry flavors that veer towards bitterness. This finishes woody, dry and slightly bitter.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"An earthy, subdued nose leads to a clean palate of pear freshness. Rounded but dry, the body has a pleasantly bitter texture at its core. This finish is slightly warm but the pithy notes last with a touch of earthiness.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"A blend of five grapes, including Sauvignon Blanc, this is a crisp, kiwi- and grapefruit-flavored wine. It is bright, fruity and tangy, and it has a soft, cantaloupe-tasting finish. Ready to drink.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese White
"Red berry, crushed stone and herbs aromas open. The vibrant, polished palate delivers tart cherry, strawberry, tangerine and a hint of pastry alongside zesty acidity and small, persistent bubbles.",Italy-Italy Other-Sparkling Blend
"A rare disappointment for a Grosses Gewächs wine. Although solid, it lacks the expected fireworks, instead delivering off-dry honey, anise and oil notes and finishing with a distinctly sweet-sour edge.",Germany-Rheinhessen-Riesling
"While sprightly and sweet on the attack, this deeply fruity Riesling deepens on the palate with layers of earth and smoky mineral tones. Juicy apricot and pink-grapefruit notes linger on the finish with an astringent touch of lemon rind.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"A rich, candied Pinot Noir, filled with raspberry, cherry and mocha flavors. It's a bit simple, but deliciously so, with a crisply silky texture.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Dusty white-fruit and citrus aromas are more than adequate but nonspecific. This feels round, with salty citrus flavors. A modest finish is doing its best to stay fresh and vital.",Chile-Central Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a very attractive wine with bursting cherry notes and vibrant layers of sweet spice and clove. You'll also get root beer, chopped herbs, tobacco and leather: the wine is thick and firm with oak-driven flavors.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"This wine is juicy and fruity, with generous tannins that support its ripe black fruit and balanced acidity. It has a smoky edge and will be ready to drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"There's lots of sweet oak in this wine, with dominant flavors of buttered toast, buttered popcorn and vanilla. Underneath there's some nice apricot and tangerine fruit.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Riding the delicate balance between ripeness and freshness, Adam Comartin's bottling shows warm white peach and toasted cashew on the nose alongside sea salt, tangerine pith, white jasmine, light honey and apple crème brûlée aromas. Ripe stonefruit flavors are deftly cut by sizzling acidity on the palate.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A wine that is proof that not all powerful wines also need high alcohol, this intense 13% ABV wine is concentrated, almost black in its color, a classic Malbec. It has all the solid tannins, structure, the darkest of black plums and licorice flavors. It should age well.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Tense and tannic, it's very dry initially, before opening up to show its rich blackberry and plum flavors. The structure is impressive with wood spice layered with tight fruit tannins. Worth aging for 3–4 years.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Still holding its deep red color, this is otherwise a wine that is now mature and ready to drink, hailing from the first vintage of the Vadio Project. It has earthy flavors of bramble and undergrowth, and a dry character that will become more pronounced over the next years. Luis Patrão started the organic Vadio Project to preserve the native Baga grape grown nine miles from the Atlantic Ocean in central Portugal.",Portugal-Bairrada-Baga
"Very pure and totally appetizing notes of ripe pear and juicy Golden Delicious Apple fill the nose. The same insistent lively fruitiness pervades the taut, dry and very juicy palate alongside a blazing vein of lemon freshness. This is full of fruit, life and freshness. The finish has a lifted touch of conifer and is totally refreshing and whistle clean.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"A light and crisp wine that has a creamed apple texture. It is fruity, light with a fine citrus tang to add to the general freshness of the wine. The name suggests a very appropriate pairing.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"Funky aromas of wet dog, grapy berry fruits and hickory are sketchy. This feels more baked and flat than lively, while flavors of oaky, creamy berry fruits are mildly green. A thick, oaky finish is more gummy than fresh.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"A bit hot and heavy, lacking the freshness you want in a new-release Pinot Noir. The flavors are of cherries and blackberries baked into a pie that got a little overcooked.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This pleasant, easy-to-drink Chardonnay features subtle oak notes framing white peach and sweet-corn flavors. It's medium bodied, with a tender texture and ample pineapple and pear on the finish. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Chardonnay

"This wine starts off with an enticing honeycomb and baked apple aroma, followed by secondary accents of baking spice and orange zest. The fully textured mouth is loaded with dried peach and apricot flavors, followed by a nice citrus zip that adds spring to the long finish.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Chenin Blanc
"While the wine is rich and fruity, it also a cool, crisp edge that comes from the nearby ocean. Red-berry fruits are shot through with acidity and a dry core of tannin. The pepper and spice flavor probably comes from the high alcohol.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese Red
"Pure purple fruit aromas arise on the nose of this bottling by pioneer Fred Brander, as do heady cocoa, leather and herb-crusted beef roast scents. Fresh black currant and espresso cream flavors show on the palate, with a chalky tannic structure that steadily reveals more layers of flavor, from blackberry to dried dill.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"As is right for a Bandol, Mourvèdre is the dominant grape in this rich wine. It is spicy from the same wood aging that also gives a mint-chocolate flavor to the powerful red-plum and berry fruits. The wine is still young, still firm. Drink from 2019.",France-Provence-Provence red blend
"An apple cider aroma comes across dusty, slightly maderized and heavy. This is a plump, wide Albariño with pithy citrus and white nectarine flavors. The finish features pithy, fleshy accents. Drink now.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Beautifully dense, this generous, rich wine combines great fruit with a firm but sweet structure. The new wood element is still prominent, but this is now beginning to blend well with the ripe fruit. To finish, the tannins reassert themselves.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This stylish wine opens with a floral, perfumed, high-altitude bouquet that shows red currant and raspberry aromas. Like the nose, the palate is fresh and not ponderous. Crisp raspberry and cassis flavors finish with freshness and elegance. Drink through 2020.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Château de Rully is managed by Rodet. It has produced a firm, dark and smoky wine in 2010. It's firm, solid, with an earthy, undergrowth edge. At the same time, its weight and density promise some good aging over at least five years.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This is a peppery, deep wine that's fun to explore. It has black pepper and roasted meat aromas, dry flavors like cranberry and pomegranate, and a good, firm texture that begs for beef bourguignon or pot roast.",US-California-Red Blend
"Saint-Maur's vines are planted close to Saint-Tropez in one of the warmest sectors of the Provence coast. This wine is firm and tannic, with signs of bitter coffee from extraction that are balanced by the ripe black-currant flavors. It will develop well; drink after 2017.",France-Provence-Provence red blend
"Oaky, inky aromas of blackberry and vanilla are pushy and potent. This blend of 50% Tempranillo and 50% Syrah is rubbery and pinched on the palate, while toasty, rooty flavors of black fruits blend with herbal berry and coffee notes. A narrow finish is herbal in flavor and weighty. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"Rooty, spicy aromas of black plum are more complex than those of your average Malbec. In the mouth, this shows a heavy, almost reduced mouthfeel that could use more spring. Dark, heavily toasted baked-plum flavors finish peppery and brooding, but without much texture or presence. Drink soon.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Beautiful, aromatic notes of yellow and red apple peel on the nose acquire the slightest bitterness on the palate. The frothy, airy mousse is soft and the flavors are balanced, fruit-driven and have an almost autumnal, earthy apple tinge.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"Sharply defined, this has piercing, penetrating high notes that are both floral and fruity. Its lemon and tangerine fruit is amped up with some alcoholic burn. Aerating it helps to smooth it out.",US-Oregon-Viognier
"This is a big, mouthfilling Cabernet, rich and voluptuous in fruit. Although it's a bit hot in alcohol, you hardly notice it, with the explosion of blackberries, raisins and chocolate-covered cherries, made even richer by smoky-sweet oak. Delicious now and through 2014.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This barrel selection evokes the AVA's black-cherry fruit character nicely, keeping it lively and balanced, with excellent depth. Tasting the wine is like gazing into a deep pool; the flavors keep pushing further into the finish. Streaks of coffee and milk chocolate are in the mix, but it's the excellent fruit that captures your attention and holds it.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This 25% whole cluster bottling from the Full Draw Vineyard shows black cherry, leather, cola and sarsaparilla scents on the nose. Cherry cola and vanilla flavors mark the palate, where medium acidity and persistent tannins ensure solid cellaring potential. Drink 2018–2025.",US-California-Tempranillo

"Fairly large, dark and extracted, but also lush and rich, with aromas of raisin and stewed blackberry. The palate is rich to the point of almost being heavy, while the flavors of blackberry and roasted black plum are mildly leathery and salty. Nice, big, meaty and tasty for the price.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Syrah
"From the 2004 vintage, this is a thin and slightly sour Valpolicella that would pair with cheesy pizza or ravioli filled with ricotta. The natural freshness and brightness of the fruit will cut through fatty dishes.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Despite its obvious pedigree (Cannubi may be Barolo's most famous cru site), this Riserva lacks some of the depth and complexity you can expect from this vineyard. The 2005 vintage has pushed up the alcohol, but otherwise the wine is marked by berry, violet and cola aromas.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Ice wines are a rarity in Washington. This one offers aromas of orange peel, flowers and candied ginger, seeming to show a touch of oxygen exposure. It's sweet (155g/L residual sugar) but is still quite deft in style.",US-Washington-Riesling
"From premier cru vineyards on the Montagne de Reims, this finely balanced wine is tight and crisp with fine acidity. Its white fruits and lively feel are allied to a creamy texture to produce a Champagne that is ready to drink now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
Basic aromas of fruity Chiclets gum introduce a palate with low acidity and a sense of weight and friction. This plump rosé tastes of spiced melon. The finish is low on verve and thus prematurely soft. Drink immediately for best results.,Spain-Northern Spain-Rosé
"Gorgeous color and concentration with brilliant ruby highlights make this a beautiful wine to contemplate in the glass. The aromas are broad and far-reaching with a high mineral component, small berry fruit, spice and a distinct soapy-lavender element. Chewy, firm and succulent, it's a mouth-watering bruiser that leaves a lasting imprint on the palate. Only 60 cases made.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Lime, tarragon and fresh green aromas are a bit minerally and stony in front of a linear, pure palate. Flavors of lemon-lime, peach and nectarine are just right, moderately minerally and fade away with clarity and style. Drink right away.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"A honeyed note clings to the ripe fruit of Bosc pear. The palate adds immense and appetizing spice to the pear notions, edging it with pepper and yeasty notes of soy and sandalwood. The palate is ripe and concentrated but deeply textured and made precise by zesty grapefruit freshness. It appears compact and precise and has a lasting, impressive impact, shining with pure fruit and aromatics. Lovely now but certain to improve with some bottle age. Drink 2017–2035.",Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
"Chalky tannins and subdued fruit and tannin weight make this an inviting, food-friendly wine, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller amounts of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Made from estate vineyards, it's rich in black cherry and dark chocolate, concentrated and layered. It ends in a spicy back note of pepper. Cellar through 2022.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"While most of this wine was fermented in French oak, a small percentage was held back in stainless steel. It finds a happy middle ground between creamy oak, even a touch of reduction, and a brightness of green apple and Jolly Rancher. It offers medium-bodied richness.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The nose on this blend of Grenache, Carignan and other grapes burns and smells of iodine, mushroom, olive and rustic berry fruits. High acidity and an obtuse mouthfeel house salty, briny, minerally plum flavors, while the finish runs low on fruit.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"This simple white isn't very expressive, but the palate eventually reveals unripe yellow apple and green pear. It's diluted, with a short finish.",Italy-Central Italy-Trebbiano
This wine comes from village appellation vineyards. It is soft and without the powerful tannins often found in the area. It compensates with dark berry fruits and some ripe tannins that are finely integrated into the wine. Acidity at the end adds to the potential of this wine which will be best from 2019.,France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Creamy aloe vera, white pepper, green pear and lemon zest create an irresistible nose. The palate is equally creamy but also comes on light, tiptoe feet. There is a pleasant, slightly bitter zesty edge to the slender palate which belies all the charm. An intriguing, arresting Grüner.",Austria-Wagram-Grüner Veltliner
"The delicate nose on this reserve Chard offers citrus and flowers with a touch of nutty spice. On the palate, it's a straightforward white with elements of lemon citrus, grapefruit and hazelnut. An easy-drinking Chardonnay with class.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"The winery identifies this as “the best barrels from our best lots.” Supple and streaked with chocolate and caramel, this explosion of cherry, cassis, cola and Dr. Pepper contains sneaky notes of tobacco and pepper threaded through the lingering finish.

"Here's a big, inky dessert wine, sporting a dark garnet, almost black color, with masculine aromas of mesquite wood, barbecue sauce, root beer, prune and jammy blackberry.

"Made with organically farmed grapes, this has aromas suggesting acacia honey and toasted nut. The aromas carry over to the palate along with mature yellow apple and a marked note of bitter almond. Zesty acidity lifts the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Vernaccia
"This is almost as impressive as Gerin's La Champine Syrah, which is a tremendous achievement as Viognier seems much harder to do well. Hints of crushed stone and struck flint add nuance to the ripe apricot aromas, while the exotic, tropical fruit flavors of mango and pineapple are reined in by a touch of citrus-pith bitterness. Drink now–2018.",France-Rhône Valley-Viognier
"A full-bodied wine made from Pinot Noir, this has richness and weight, accentuated by green-plum and lime flavors, but also an intense acidity. There's a great depth of fruit and flavor, making this a food Champagne par excellence.",France-Champagne-Pinot Noir
"Firmly structured and elegant, this offers aromas of pressed rose, violet, menthol, savory herb and woodland berry.

"Bradley Brown's Syrah magic shines again on this wine from a vineyard planted 2,300 feet over the eastside of the Salinas Valley. The wine is redolent on the nose, with black pepper, crushed violet and salted pork. It pulls a tannic punch to the mouth once sipped, with blackberry, leather, heavy-duty tar and persistent pepper. Decant for maximum flavor extraction.",US-California-Syrah
"Bright, cheery plum and cherries abound on this juicy, primary Cabernet Franc. Forward and fruity, it's plump and rich in texture with a soft fringe of tannins. Hints of menthol and cherry blossom perfume add lift.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc

"Here's a beautifully evolved Brunello di Montalcino (from Agricoltori del Geografico) that shows both elegance and harmony within layers of fruit, spice and earth. The wine articulates many of the most pleasurable characteristics associated with Sangiovese Grosso: elegance and liveliness.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
This wine falls short of its rather lofty ambitions with lavish new French oak treatment resulting in a diminished fruit profile. Sawdust notes dominate the nose while the faintest hint of cherry can be detected on the palate. Finishes a bit tart. A good choice for those hankering for a vanilla milkshake.,US-New York-Pinot Noir
"This is an intriguing offering, with aromas of crushed flower, herb, orange peel, blue fruit and wet stone. The palate is loaded with fruit and savory flavors that show a delicate styling. The balance is downright impressive.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Mint aromas and flavors lead to an intense wine that is powered at this young stage by firm, serious tannins.

From consultant Luis Duarte, this is a wine for long-term aging; hold for 6–7 years or more.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"From a parcel of the Fourchaume premier cru vineyard that is on the same slope as the Grand Crus, this is a ripe, full-bodied wine, packed with fruit while still firmly structured. Tropical and yellow fruits, hints of pineapple and apricots give richness, set against a mineral, textured aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"An ill-defined wine, closed and tight, this just hints at fruit without showing much intensity. The aftertaste has some bright lemon zest texture.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Voluptuous and expansive in texture, this wine offers a wealth of honey-apple and margarita-lime flavor accented by a streak of stone. The richness is balanced by juicy acidity that lifts the experience all along to the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Light and refreshing in style, this wine boasts slightly confected cherry fruit amplified by bright acidity. It's straightforward and relatively simple; drink it over the next year or so.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir

Shows ripe, lush citrus, tropical fruit, peach, mineral and white flower flavors, finished with dusty cinnamon spices.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Dusty mineral and smoke tones add complexity to fresh lemon and lime aromas on this concentrated, powerful off-dry Riesling. It's lush and silky on the palate, with ripe pineapple and yellow peach flavors. Lime juice acidity jolts the finish.",US-New York-Riesling
"This has the sharp, citrus skin phenolics characteristic of many Viogniers, but a rather soft middle tastes like green bananas more than citrus. Those banana flavors roll into the finish, then quickly fade.",US-Oregon-Viognier
"This starts off with bell pepper aromas and hints of espresso, oak, vanilla, plum and soy sauce. It's direct and straightforward, with an international profile and easy personality.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Notes of cinnamon and peppercorns adds complexity to the cranberry-pomegranate fruit and slate minerality on the nose of this single-vineyard expression. It's more reserved in its palate, which offers cranberry tang with an herbal sagebrush quality, proving a reliable, straightforward take on the grape.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Loaded with pretty black-cherry flavor, this is a Cabernet-based, Bordeaux-style blend. Sourced from Klipsun, Red Willow, Olsen and Stillwater Creek, it shows a fair amount of stiff, slightly green tannins. The earthy subtext is all in proportion, and this plays like a young Bordeaux. Give it some extra breathing time.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"In a ripe Bordeaux year, Sauvignon Blanc goes towards tropical and yellow fruits, making it ripe while also light and crisp. This refreshing, rounded wine is ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux-Sauvignon Blanc

The palate is fresh and rather light, with plums, figs, crushed peppercorns and a forest floor/pine needle intrigue.",US-California-Merlot
"This Cabernet Franc is superripe and oaky, with earthy, stewed and woody aromas. In the mouth, this feels grippy, resiny and dense.

Combined with the ripe yellow fruits, they give an opulent wine that will age for several years. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Excessive sharpness mars this wine. It's tart to the point of sour. Too bad, because it has a nice, silky texture and savory raspberry and cherry flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Luca Bosio's pretty Moscato d'Asti opens with characteristic aromas of ginger, tangerine skin and acacia flower. This sweet sparkler presents a mouthful of creamy foam and bright bubbles.",Italy-Piedmont-Moscato
"Menthol and sweet sage aromas leap off this wine from Steve Clifton. They spice up the black cherry and blackberry juice backbone that comes from this Nipomo vineyard, located seven miles from the Pacific. The palate shows lots of energetic verve, with flavors of dried cranberries, raspberries, licorice and slate, finishing long on a sagebrush-driven sense of chaparral.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The color is deep, the aromas thick with wood smoke, bacon and dried plums, and the flavors are ripe, like blackberry syrup but dry. This is full bodied and very firm in texture due to mouth-coating tannins that are nearly matched on the finish by persistent and bold fruit flavors. Tasty now, it should age nicely through 2020.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made in a relatively restrained style, this is a dark, juicy and smoky wine from Dry Creek and Alexander Valley area vineyard sites. Lengthy and smooth, it takes a decidedly medium-bodied route, with traces of leather pouch on the nose and a soft layering of milk chocolate on the finish.",US-California-Zinfandel

"This multivineyard blend isn't cheap, but it's almost as good as Farrell's more expensive single-vineyard Pinots, which makes it kind of a value. Like them, it's a dry, crisply acidic wine, and slightly austere. It shows tobacco-infused cherry pie filling, pomegranate, rhubarb and cola flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Herb, red apple, copper penny and dark cherry aromas are followed by sweet, full dark cherry flavors. The tannins are firm, needing some time to soften.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Elegant and austere, this opens with thick layers of chocolate fudge, toasted espresso bean, Christmas spice and overripe berry fruit. It boasts huge flavor intensity and big alcohol. This is a bold Amarone that's perfect for long weekends at a ski lodge or cozy nights at home..","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This Merlot includes 13% Syrah, along with smaller amounts of Petit Verdot and Cabernet.

This is the wine to go with your tri-tip.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Shows the rich fruit, acidity and silky texture of Calera's spot on Mount Harlan, with cherry, cola and sweet sandalwood flavors. It's not as complex or concentrated as the single-vineyard bottlings, but is a good approximation.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Loaded with finesse, this bright creamy wine hits all the right buttons. It opens with lovely scents of acacia flower and white stone fruit while the polished silky palate delivers yellow apple, ripe pear and lemon zest alongside fresh acidity. An elegant mousse lends suppleness.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Deliciously fresh and fruity, this is a wine full of ripe apples and crisp pears. It's full bodied, but bright with intense acidity. The characteristic pepper touch of Grüner shows at the end of this full and concentrated wine. Screwcap.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner

Give the tannins another year or two to soften, then drink up to enjoy the remaining freshness and fruit.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Sweet, tannic and superfruity, this blend of Dolcetto, Zin, Merlot, Tempranillo and Carignane is rustic and clean. With its flood of blackberry, cherry, chocolate and spice flavors, it will happily wash down simple fare, like cheeseburgers.",US-California-Red Blend
"A bit developed already, with a round mouthfeel and some honey character accented by citrus and gingery-peppery spice. Pleasant to drink now, but seems to lack the vivacity for extended aging.",Australia-Western Australia-Riesling
"This Cabernet Sauvignon's vanilla, baking spice, dill, herb and cherry aromas are locked up. The palate brings plenty of vanilla flavors backed by gritty tannins, but the oak is too prominent and distracting.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc, 10% Syrah and 10% Petit Verdot, this has aromas that recall black-skinned berries, leather and Mediterranean herbs. The palate is just as lush: black currant, tobacco and baking spice flavors, framed by supple tannins. Enjoy through 2020.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"A pure, clean mineral-driven Champagne. It's very crisp, with a chalky texture, flavors of green apples and tight acidity. It's one of those Champagnes that needs time in the glass, because as it opens the flavors become more complex, bringing out yellow fruits as well as the underlying citrus.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"Delivers lots of bang for the buck. Shows real Chardonnay character, with rich vanilla cream-infused flavors of ripe pineapples, pears, sautéed bananas, buttered toast and honey. At this price, it's a fantastic buy that can stand next to Chards costing far more.",US-California-Chardonnay

"96–98. Barrel sample. This powerful, impressive wine is comprised of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon.

"This is a light, clear and beguiling wine, not for everyone, somewhat reduced and yet lurking in brooding fruit and interwoven spice. It drinks almost like a white wine in its shocking minerality, before delving into a dark and noble forest floor's worth of pine, wild mushroom and rose. Let this wine open awhile and enjoy how it changes in the glass.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Sourced from Red Willow, Olsen and Les Collines, this is the finest effort yet from Gramercy Cellars and one of the greatest Syrahs ever produced in Washington state. Think Hermitage with brighter fruit. It's intensely aromatic, dense and seamless, stacked with rich flavors of mixed berries, layers of smoke, earth and herb, and punctuated by citrusy acidity. Highlights of oranges and tangerines sneak into the finish, which lingers for an astonishingly long time. Exceptional in every way.",US-Washington-Syrah

"Aromas of toast, oak, coconut, vanilla, mocha and mature plum lead the nose. Oak-driven sensations drive the robust palate along with ripe berry and a confectionary note. Scorching alcohol dominates the finish and throws this off-balance while bracing tannins leave an astringent close.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Muted, broad orchard fruit and lemon flavors are etched with acids that become more lifted on the finish. An easy-drinking wine to pair with mild white fish, like tilapia.",US-Virginia-Chardonnay
"Lactic oak and rubbery black fruit aromas lead to a wiry, acidic palate. This is limited in its flavor range, with plum and berry flavors leading the way. An edgy feeling finish with plum and snappy acidity is not too demanding.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Merlot

A little hot and aggressive, so drink in late 2010 through 2012.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"It's really splitting hairs when evaluating Huber's 2007 R bottlings. This one comes across as slighty reduced, with some cabbage-like notes that require vigorous swirling to dissipate. Yet it remains complex, with black cherries and a slightly more muscular, tannic style than Huber's other '07s. Drink 2013–2020.",Germany-Baden-Spätburgunder

"Perhaps it's simply too young, but this latest Pinot Gris from Deer Creek does not show the complexity of recent vintages. It's loaded with fresh apple-juice snap and flavor and a squeeze of lemon. Clean and fruit-centric, there's nothing at all wrong with it, and it's a fine thirst-quencher for a hot summer afternoon.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"The extra depth typical of Pouilly Fumé is here. It makes for a full-bodied and dense wine ripe with red apple, lemon and a tangy, orange-zest aftertaste. The wine is still developing and needs time. Drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine opens with a curious waft of pastry-like vanilla cream underneath cherry tart and a squeeze of citrus.

"There are people out there who will love this big, blustery Cab, with its powerful fruit and oak, its bacon fat reminiscent of other high-octane reds under the Earthquake label.

"Here's a wine with great bones: nicely structured with firm tannins and good supportive acidity. It's not light and flabby, but it is very drinkable. Flavors? Think of cola laced with black-cherry juice with a dash of Worcestershire. It's very dry, and the long finish turns spicy.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Inky oaky aromas of graphite and black fruits introduce a palate that's supremely saturated. Flavors of roasted plum and blackberry are savory and meaty, while this feels lush on the finish but also strapping and sinewy. Dos Mundos purports to represent both Portugal and Argentina, but this is all Argentina in character. Drink through 2023.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Merlot (59%) takes the lead on this blend, which is balanced out by Cabernet Franc. Intriguing aromas of herbs, flowers, spice raspberries, café au lait and barrel spices lead to silky, polished fruit and barrel flavors that linger.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This demonstrates, as well as any other example, that exceptional wines were made in the often-maligned 2011 vintage. Cranberry, raspberry, cola and allspice elements are woven gracefully in a lovely wine that closes with just a faint, beguiling whiff of smoke.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"The Laurelwood offers sharp flavors of pine tar, threaded through fresh fruit. Apple and orange are there in abundance, and the piny accents will be an interesting highlight for some tasters, but a distraction for others.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Racy and tight-bodied red wine, with a strained, herbal set of aromas and a high-acid, razor's-edge palate of lively red fruit flavors and an offset of drying oak. Too generic and tough on the cheeks to tip the scale.",Chile-Rapel Valley-Carmenère
"Early aromas of wet cement and rubber transition to leafy, herbal and mildly green. This feels tight, drawing and unforgiving. Flavors of leafy, roasted plum and berry are slightly stalky, while the finish is juicy in feel and herbal in flavor.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend

"This Malbec-led blend is quite oaky, thus maple, molasses and chocolate aromas ride high alongside blackberry and mild floral notes. In the mouth, this is quasi-syrupy and very rich.

It brings a sense of tension, texture and finesse that is completely captivating.",US-Oregon-Grenache

"This begins with aromas of herb-crusted, charred pork belly, graphite and shaved wood. A touch of black fruit lingers in the background of the palate, but the stars are black pepper, licorice, hard herbs, black soot, asphalt and very grippy tannins. Wait at least until 2016 for some mellowing.",US-California-Syrah
"Not everyone will love this Aglianico-based rosé from volcanic soils in Basilicata, but most will find its sweet marzipan aromas quite attractive.

"A heady mixture of lemon custard and baked pear marks the entry to this full-bodied, deliciously decadent wine, from a high-elevation site above the Petaluma Gap. Honeyed aromas maintain themselves in the glass, accented in floral honeysuckle and ginger. Lovely and generous, it softens as it goes.",US-California-Chardonnay

"A to Z has kept a lid on its pricing, and offers one of the best values in Oregon Pinot Noir. Though very young, this wine is soft and forward, and benefits from its early release. It could almost pass for a cru Beaujolais, from the slightly candied cherry fruit right down to the hints of banana that suggest a certain amount of whole cluster fermentation. In any event, it's fruity, lightly detailed with spice, and quite charming, though not as substantial as its 2006 predecessor.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"Floral aromas of acacia and Spanish broom mingle with yellow stone fruit and toasted nut. On the medium-bodied palate, a note of bitter almond underscores ripe apricot and tangerine zest. Fresh acidity lifts the rich flavors.",Italy-Central Italy-Albana

"Making top-flight Marlborough Pinot Noir wasn't easy in 2014, so this is an especially notable effort from Kevin Judd. Classic savory, forest-floor notes frame black-tea and plum flavors in this concentrated, richly textured wine. Drink now–2022.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir

It has weight and concentration, and its acidity is balanced by the ripe orange and red apple flavors that are cut by a steely edge.

"This wine is soft both in acidity and tannins, and simple and semisweet, with sugared raspberry tea and cola flavors, and isn't going anywhere.",US-California-Syrah

"Lush, forward and complete, with a full mix of sweet and spicy aromas leading to bright berry flavors accented by licorice and vanilla from well-managed oak.

"Well-integrated blueberry and purple flower aromas make for a casual rather than bombastic nose in this blend of 32% Syrah, 28% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre and 15% Petite Sirah. Roasted meat, charred blackberry and dried fennel notes show on the palate, feeling very balanced and acid-even.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Underbrush, cooking spices, dark berry and scorched earth aromas waft out of the glass. On the firm, full-bodied palate, licorice, tobacco and clove accent the core of ripe black cherry.

"This Meritage is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Tasting quite ripe, it has a burnt sage and cedar undertone. Tannins hit on the back of the palate with power and not much finesse.",US-California-Meritage
"Incredible purity rises from the glass, reminiscent of iced pear slices on a bed of the freshest chervil. The palate is filigree and savory, lithe, translucent but intense and shimmering with stone and earth, with pear and apple, with chervil and tangy peel. What light-footed, concentrated and yet elegant joy. This is resolutely dry and shows what Sylvaner does in the right hands.",France-Alsace-Sylvaner
"Scattered aromas of horseradish, cotton candy and vinegar are all over the map but don't convey varietal character or purity. This new wine from terraced vineyards in deep, rural Maule feels clipped, with heavy tannins. Mixed berry flavors are bitter and rubbery, and the finish is grabby and awkward. This is a first release; suffice it to say it needs more work to justify its price.",Chile-Maule Valley-Pinot Noir
"This wine offers tropical fruit against a background of intense acidity. That makes it fruity, ripe with a tight structure that gives delicious lift and freshness. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

Drink now.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Sauvignon Blanc

"The great 2010 vintage has produced an appropriately powerful and dense wine. With its tannins and concentrated, dry flavors, this wine is still young. It has power, the rich black fruit still masked by the structure. It will need long aging, so drink from 2018.",France-Southwest France-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromatic accents here include apple cider, chocolate and cherry. The wine has personality but sings out of tune in places, although it could work well with easy pasta or meat dishes. This expression of the wine has 80% Negroamaro and 20% Malvasia Nera.",Italy-Southern Italy-Red Blend
"Perfumed wood dominates this wine, giving it structure and tannins. Juicy red fruits are still submerged beneath this welter of dryness. The wine needs time to integrate. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This extremely limited-production Merlot (about 250 cases) is Alex and Paul Golitzin's “other” great red. It's all Klipsun Vineyard fruit, 75% Merlot and 25% Cabernet, and its soft, chocolatey tannins envelope the taste buds in a sensual, textured landscape comprised of luscious cherry fruit and laced with hints of anise and roasted coffee. Big and extracted, yet more approachable than the Cabernet.",US-Washington-Merlot

"The term “Rutherford Bench” is not a legal one, but colloquially refers to the west side of Highway 29, where the wines, supposedly, are better. And this is quite a good wine. It's fresh and young in sweet tannins and acidity; everything's not quite integrated yet, but it's a big, rich, complexly balanced wine. Should come into its own by 2008, then hold for some years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

Drink through 2018.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"This is a linebacker wine, at 15.7% abv, bursting with roasted coffee, licorice and dry tannins all around. Soft, supple and round, and fully concentrated, the finish could use a bit more harrumph. The back label's suggestion to pair this wine with short ribs is a good call.",US-California-Petite Sirah

"Ripe, leaning to almost overripe, green and yellow-apple aromas lead to cidery flavors. Tart acidity backs it all up.",US-Washington-Sparkling Blend
"Thin and acidic, with just the barest suggestion of grapefruit juice. Maybe some pineapples. Earns an extra point or two for dryness and elegance, but really lacks richness.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Kiwi, mint and green apple notes mark the nose. Medium in weight, it features seemingly underripe acids that give the palate a discernible nerviness.",US-Virginia-Viognier
"A venture into the deep end of pricing perhaps, but the proof is in the bottle. From vines planted in 1964, this is a rich, full-bodied and creamy-textured wine, with complex notes of smoke, vanilla, plum and roasted meat. Approachable now because of its lushness, it should drink well for at least the next several years.",Australia-South Australia-Grenache
"The nose on this wine from regional pioneer Gary Eberle is reserved at first, then releases seared lemon, tightly wound stone fruit, soft butter and caramel nibs. There is a pleasant weight on the medium-density palate, with sour-leaning flavors of Granny Smith apple peels, lime rinds and some riper honeydew melon.",US-California-Chardonnay

"From the ever-emerging Asolo subregion of Prosecco Superiore, this is a fresh, tonic Prosecco, with a subdued nose of white flower and crushed stone. The sparkling wine is on the drier side of extra dry—a style that usually shows some sweetness.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"An inviting plum color, this continues with plummy fruit, accented with tart flavors of Meyer lemon, Satsuma mandarin and nectarine. Fermented on the skins for a full week, then aged in neutral French barrels, it exhibits a discreet suggestion of toast as it winds down. An all-around excellent bottle of rosé, with the body and power to accompany a winter's roast chicken.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Melon and almond skin aromas lead to pithy citrus on what amounts to a pretty good bouquet. Round, citrusy and fresh in the mouth, with orange, passion fruit and tropical leanings. Solid and well shaped for a $7 quaffer. 70% Airen and 30% Macabeo.",Spain-Central Spain-White Blend

"Bigger, richer, oaken and more structured than T-L's regular Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this cuvée flirts with being just too much.

Try after 2020?",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend

"A barely ripe blend of Pinot Gris, Pinot Blanc, Riesling and Gewürztraminer, this has strong scents and flavors that combine in a rather strange way. Perfume, breath mint and tanned leather elements pile on, without really melding or enhancing one another. Whatever it is, it's not dull.",US-Oregon-White Blend

"From a vineyard known for producing powerfully ripe, dense fruit with wet-stone minerality, this wine delivers on many of those points. It offers intense, rich tastes of baked apple, graham-cracker crust and crème brûlée. Soft and layered, it ends in a statement of big fruit.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Tastes a bit on the sweet, sugary side, but with the crisp acidity, it's balanced and elegant. The cherry, raspberry, lemongrass, vanilla, peppery spice and smoky wood flavors will work well against Thai or Vietnamese fare.",US-California-Rosé
There's a nicely perfumed element to the nose that recalls pressed blue flower or lavender potpourri. Bold berry and currant undertones form a base of plumpness and richness. Light shadings of spice and toasted nut drive the mouthfeel. Structured and firm.,Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"L'Ecole is one of the three partners in the Seven Hills vineyard, and sources its grapes from some of the oldest vines. The blend includes 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc, tight and spicy at first, then opening into a deeply flavored, brambly wine with a vivid mix of berry and stone. Firm tannins anchor it solidly and the overall structure suggests it could age for at least a decade, maybe two.",US-Washington-Merlot

"An exuberant boysenberry jam aroma and richly layered berry and dark chocolate flavors give lots of taste pleasure to this full-bodied and impressively textured wine.

"The top wine from this estate is impressive. It has rich black fruits and firm tannins, showing its youthfulness.

Drink through 2022.",Chile-Peumo-Carmenère
"Core berry aromas are fresh and solid, while nuances of wild herbs, leather and smoky rubber give this Malbec some character out of the chute.

Drink at any point over the next few years.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"For an aged, value-priced Cabernet, this is steps ahead of the competition. The nose on this ready-to-go wine is earthy and deep, with cherry and raisin notes.

Drink after 2016.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"An awesome wine. So delicious and complex now in wild cherry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper cola, bacon and smoky sandalwood flavors, brightened with crisp acidity and totally dry despite the fruitiness.

"Aromas of red berry, tilled earth, menthol and dark cooking spice unfold in the glass. The structured, elegant palate doles out ripe wild cherry, mint, licorice, blood orange and chopped herb alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. It's still tight so let it unwind for a few more years. Drink after 2019.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"All six Bordeaux grapes make an appearance in this well-oaked spicebox of a red. It's just plain delicious, from the first sniff on through. The firm mid-palate shows pretty blue, purple and black fruits, a touch of black olive, black tea, and those oh-so-tasty baking spices.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Roses and violets rise up on the nose of this wine, before a pungent fist of dirt and forest floor join the party. Layered on the entry, the midpalate becomes somewhat dull and one-dimensional, leading the way to a quick, bitter finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a ripe, creamy wine—a fine example of the richness Alvarinho can attain. It has fine fruitiness, citrus, ripe apple and pear flavors balanced by a mineral texture and acidity. Drink this fine wine from 2018.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Alvarinho
"This easy wine would pair with a roast chicken or a pork chop. The flavors are redolent of wild berry, white cherry, cola and black pepper.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
This Cab wants a few more years to let its internal inconsistencies resolve. The primary cherry and blackberry fruit has faded and is turning nutty. But it's still pretty tannic. Needs to throw some sediment to let the inherent fruit emerge. Try after 2016.,US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Smelling like a freshly mowed lawn, the nose on this bottling also offers that funky cut tennis ball and sour-apple aroma common in some Sauv Blancs. There is strong acidity once sipped, and a stony structure frames dried green apple and sour grass flavors.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Ripe and full, it offers great spice, yellow fruits and hints of tropical fruits. It has acidity and is dry, but it's delicious because of its rounded texture and generous body. Drink from 2015.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"This huge Malbec defines jammy and concentrated. The bouquet is ripe, soft and minty, while the palate echoes the nose with thickness and density. Flavors of prune, raisin, tea and blackberry are borderline syrupy, while the finish is smooth and pure but doesn't offer much spine or foundation. Drink this modern Malbec sooner rather than later.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
Passo del Lupo (85% Montepulciano with Sangiovese for extra acidity) is aged two years in oak but is nonetheless a strange wine with candied aromas of cassis and raspberry lollipop. It's a curiosity that might not appeal to everyone.,Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"Bland and soft, this has light and gently tangy fruit with apple and lime flavors. The aftertaste is fresh. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Sourced largely from Red Mountain fruit, this includes 18% Merlot in the blend. It's toasty and ripe, with the barrel flavors most evident in both nose and palate. The Cabernet fruit is mild and lightly peppery, berry and cranberry mostly. There is plenty of chocolate, toast, coffee and smoke as well, presumably from aging 20 months in oak.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Jaboulet has been investing heavily in recent years, and the terrific 2009 Terre Ferme is one of the payoffs. It's meaty and plummy on the nose, with an expansive, plush mouthfeel. Plum and black cherry flavors work well with the leather and cedar notes, while the finish lingers, picking up hints of cinnamon and licorice. Drink 2015–2025.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Earthy, slightly leathery cherry and berry aromas are nothing unusual. This is aggressive in its attack, with energy to spare. Fresh blackberry and black-plum flavors finish with resiny, lactic notes that are oak based.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The Sauvignon (64%) comes from Bacchus with the Sémillon from neighboring Dionysus. After starting out slightly reduced, fig and spice aromas lead to tart, lemon and tropical fruit flavors that need more cohesion and concentration to keep them together.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Smith & Hook has tried hard to perfect their Cab, transferring fruit sourcing from Monterey to Paso Robles. As a result, the wines are riper, as evidenced by this fruity young Cab. The cherry and blackberry flavors are balanced by firm tannins and crisp acids, making it a versatile wine at the table.",US-California-Cabernet Blend
"Here's a luminous Asti (a sweet fizzy Italian wine) with fragrant aromas of bee's wax, lavender honey and white rose. The wine is creamy and soft in the mouth with lingering sweetness and peach-like flavors on the close.",Italy-Piedmont-Moscato
"Honeysuckle, mineral, honey and botrytis aromas lead the way. This drinks off dry with exceptionally well-balanced acidity that carries through the lingering finish.",US-Washington-Riesling
"This high-toned bruiser pushes ultraripe scents of figs and raisins and prunes to the front, yet shows a green streak in the tannins. The wine spent 34 months in barrel, which adds more heavy-duty accents but does not mask the underlying stemminess.",US-Oregon-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Penetrating yellow peach and nectarine flavors anchor this mouthwatering, sun-kissed spätlese. It's gossamer-light in texture yet intensely ripe, calibrated by a thrilling streak of acidity. A delightfully sweet-tart sip to enjoy now through 2025.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Showing new wood, this is a straight down the line red Bordeaux. The tannins are firm, maybe the wood gives a burnt character but the fruit comes through strongly, giving fresh, sweet blackberry juice flavors. A good, dry, but lively finish.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Pure Malbec from the new estate vineyard, this is forward with sweetly grapy fruit flavors. Aging in 80% new oak adds a streak of espresso and pretty baking spices.",US-Oregon-Malbec
"Bottled by a leading Prosecco and grappa firm from Veneto, this has aromas of red berry, grilled herb, blue flower and a hint of leather. The palate offers wild cherry, orange zest, mocha, cinnamon, anise and coffee alongside tightly wound tannins. Drink 2018–2028.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Gold in color, this is a mature wine interesting for its roasted almond and spice flavors, very ripe and rich. Drink this full-bodied wine now.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Though not labeled as such, this is a single-vineyard wine coming from Dineen Family Vineyard. It shows appealing aromas of toast, nut oil and melon. The flavors are lighter in style but bring a sense of balance that carries through the finish.",US-Washington-Sémillon
"Earth, leather and roasted berry fruit are exactly what a wine of this base grape and price should smell like. The palate is medium in intensity, with herbal flavors, dark berry fruit notes and leather. Call it basic but comfortable, with varietal correctness.",Chile-Central Valley-Carmenère
"Owner Dominique Morel has produced a firmly structured wine that wraps firm tannins and red-cherry fruits into a crisp parcel. It is still young, bursting with fruitiness. Drink this cru wine now for its fruit, but it's better to wait until the end of 2017.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"America's sweet tooth seems to be returning, especially for Moscato, and this sweetie satisfies for its orange soda, honey and vanilla cream flavors.",US-California-Moscato
"Rich and juicy with aromas of preserved peach, fresh apple and even a hint of berries, this Riesling is dry in style, yet remarkably forward with fruit. The palate is bright, with zesty lemon-lime acidity that lingers on a medium-long finish.",US-New York-Riesling
"Classic old-school Gran Reserva. The nose is full of barbecue, molasses and dried plum, while the palate has complexities in the form of tobacco, tire rubber and earth. It goes somewhat citrusy and quick on the finish, ending in a wash of orange-infused leather and chocolate. Drink now or hold for another 5 years.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This comes from a dry-farmed site, all the better to coax out its stony minerality and delicate aromas of rose garden an d geranium. Fully expressive, it's voluptuous and lushly balanced, offering wild strawberry and tons of forest floor.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Fresh raspberry-flavored sparkling wine, with vivid acidity but also some softness. It has a bright, crisp texture, lively and refreshing. The wine comes from a small parcel next to the Hospices de Saumur.",France-France Other-White Blend
"Fresh and fruity without overdoing it, this medium-bodied wine has light notes of apple, banana, peach and cherry in the aromas and the flavors, and a good snappy texture to balance them out. Perfect for the cocktail hour.",US-California-Rhône-style White Blend
Smoky spice and dried herbs on the nose are followed by flavors of rustic spice and red fruit on the palate. Vibrant fruit and muscular tannins are integrated by a clean minerality. The wine has native character but will please many palates with its dimension.,South Africa-Western Cape-Red Blend
"This crisp wine comes from one of upper vineyards of the village. It is packed with apples and citrus, plus a touch of toast. With lively acidity, this wine will age well. Drink from 2021.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"The spicy wood aroma that shows strongly on the nose of this wine is confirmed on the palate, as it seems to have spent too much time in barrels. The fruit has been neglected and is dry. It will open up with time, although the dryness will probably remain.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Mature plum, baking spice and tobacco aromas lead the way on this structured red. Made with late-harvested grapes, the dense, enveloping palate offers black cherry extract, mocha, licorice and a confectionery note alongside velvety tannins. It closes on a dark chocolate note.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"Some tasters will celebrate the elegance and finesse of this lightweight Pinot; time will be the ultimate judge. At the moment it is a bit out of balance; there is light cherry fruit, plenty of alcohol, some grainy, earthy tannins and overall a lack of integration. Maybe it just needs more time in the bottle; the components are good enough—tart cranberry and strawberry flavors, sharp acids, some minerality and an earthy underpinning. It just hasn't (yet) come together.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A nice Chardonnay, with enough elegance to drink with fine food. Dry and crisp, it shows mineral-infused peach, lemon and pineapple flavors that are wrapped into quite a bit of smoky oak. Drink now.",US-California-Chardonnay
Blossom and citrus inform the nose—white jasmine hovers alongside grapefruit and orange. The palate is juicy and full of bouncy easy fruit on a fluid dryish body. Bright lemon freshness makes the fruit flavors even more vivid. The balance between fruit and freshness gives this tension and makes it very moreish. The finish is clean and orange scented.,France-Alsace-Riesling
"Sweet and honeyed, but flat and cloying. Candied melon and citrus flavors run heavy and chunky, and the finish is more of the same. Big, ripe, sticky and sweet but definitely not elevated in class.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"A bit simple, but definitely not shy on flavor, bursting with melon and pear fruit. It's an attempt at an Alsatian style, full and weighty in the mouth, and showing a trace of heat on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"Rich yet plenty retentive of acidity, this coastal white is complex in tropical mango and papaya while also offering finely tuned layers of fig and honeycomb. Light enough to enjoy on its own or with delicate fare, it's an enjoyable wine made well in small quantities.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Sangiovese Grosso (specifically the BBS11 clone identified by Biondi-Santi) is enhanced with 5% Cabernet Sauvignon to produce a thickly structured wine with aromas of smoked beef, mature cherry and moist earth.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A clean aroma of apple that's detailed with light notes of fresh herb and barrel toast introduce this well-structured Chardonnay. It's a solid effort, buoyed by good natural acidity.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Crisp and bright in flavor like Pippin apples, this wine is light bodied, braced by good acidity and has a refreshing cleansing effect on the palate. With more character than many similar wines, it's worth seeking out.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"While herbaceous and green on the nose, this almost-dry kabinett is luscious and fruity on the palate, with bursts of white grapefruit and tangerine. It's bold and expansive in mouthfeel, with a brace of citrus pith on the finish.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"With its well-handled new wood treatment, this wine instead has gone for full-bodied richness. The wood is definitely an important element, but its ripe, smooth black plum juice and blueberry flavors share the honors of this delicious wine equally. In 2–3 years, this will be a wine for luxuriating.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Generous, fruity and ripe, this unpretentious red blend based on Syrah lets the pure fruit flavors carry it rather than laying on heavy oak flavors. It is medium-bodied, broad-textured, very juicy and delicious.",US-California-Red Blend
"A bit of dust and leather for openers, with short black-fruit flavors and a big wave of tannins on the palate. So expect some grab and choppiness. Despite moderate hardness, there's good dark fruit and limited herbal intrusion.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Big and firm, this is packed with red fruits and solid tannins. It has flavors of red berries and black fruits—the wood component still prominent. The acidity is gentle; but it does need to age for at least four years.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Firm and tannic, a wine that, at this stage, is putting structure before fruit. That will change over 4–5 years as the dry tannins soften into the ripe plum and cranberry juice fruits underneath. While not weighty, this is a delicious, well-crafted wine.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This light and well-made wine drinks easily and tastes just as clean and fresh as you would expect from this Oregon producer. It's crisp and inviting, with a solid structure revolving around green apple fruit and fine details of just-picked herbs.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Aromas recall acacia flower, chamomile and beeswax. The palate offers subtle lemon-lime, notes of yellow peach, toast and a hint of sage. You'll also notice evident alcohol.",Italy-Tuscany-Vermentino
"The Stiftsbreite vineyard has a claim to fame: It is the largest St. Laurent vineyard in the world. This fruity wine sums up the grape with ripe red berry and spicy black cherry flavors, just bursting with juice and bright acidity.",Austria-Thermenregion-St. Laurent
"this is a lovely effort and a great value from Sidewood in the Adelaide Hills. Grilled peaches provide the flesh, while a bright, citrusy note adds focus and length to this ripe, rich Chardonnay. Drink now–2020.",Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"The winery's just-released 2011 Cab is vigorous and good. Its tannins are a little rugged, with tongue-sticky astringency. Underneath that comes a burst of cherries, currants, plums and smoky oak. The wine doesn't feel like a long-term ager, but it does provide plenty of pleasure now and will hang in there until 2018–2019.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Some ageable Cabs are also drinkable on release. Not this one. It's just too tannic. The astringency stings the palate, making the acidity feel more pronounced, and effectively smothering the fruit. But it's good, rich blackberry fruit. Already throwing some sediment, the wine should begin to come into its own around 2018.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Solid black cherry aromas distinguish this wine from the competition. It has poise for a Madrid wine, and the mix of Tempranillo, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon delivers a saturated palate with natural, full-bodied flavors that aren't too infused with oak. Concentrated and well made, with good size.",Spain-Central Spain-Red Blend
"Woodspice, herb and coffee aromas vie for attention on this blend of Champoux (60%) and Ciel du Cheval vineyard fruit. The black-fruit flavors show a good sense of balance that lingers through the long, mesquite-accented finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"This Riserva Chianti Classico opens with earthy, gritty aromas of forest floor, wild mushroom and deep, dark berry fruit. It shows a layered, sophisticated side of Sangiovese with lingering spice and cola on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Serious spice, black currant and herb flavors combine with firm tannins to produce a wine that is both structured and age worthy. Made from grapes sourced from the Deutschkreutz region of central Burgenland, this should be kept for another year. Screwcap.",Austria-Burgenland-Blaufränkisch
"This private reserve is 93% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot, aged considerably in bottle. Rich and full-bodied, it has a vanilla-kissed nose and earthy leather pedigree, the black cherry flavor concentrated and thick.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Arguably the best Ysios reserva to date; it shows a full, lightly baked bouquet with berry aromas, spice, barrel char and herbs. Feels fresh and lush, with balance and tasty flavors of black fruit, fig, tobacco and chocolaty oak. It's a touch oaky and warm on the finish, but elegant and very well made. Drink now through 2015.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This wine is 100% varietal, all aged in once-used French oak. It's packed to the brim with black fruit, herbs, licorice, jalapeño pepper and barrel spices, with crystalline clarity to the aromas. There's plenty of depth and richness to the full-bodied flavors, with exquisite balance and a finish that lingers.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Kicks off with pretty cherry notes in the nose. Dry and bright on the palate, the wine shows lovely ripe Bing cherry flavors, elegant citrus and clean mineral notes. A refreshing and satisfying rosé.",US-California-Sangiovese
"Sweet and rich in fruit and smoky oak, with thick tannins and the rustic mouthfeel of a youthful Petite Sirah. The flavors are of jammy blackberries, cherries, leather, coffee and black pepper. Should age for a long time without necessarily gaining elegance.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"While a tad more slender in frame than many of 2015's single-vineyard Kabinetts, this delicate Riesling offers a zesty punch of sweet-tart tangerine and quince flavors. It's irresistibly thirst quenching, finishing on a salty tang of mineral and lime.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"This is a soft style of Champagne, just hinting at the minerality often found in Chardonnays from the Côte des Blancs. It is ripe, with red apple and pear flavors, shot through with lime acidity. The aftertaste adds a more textured character.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"There's a subtle richness to this well-balanced wine, evident in toasty accents of hazelnut and peach pit that compliment the honeydew and juicy pear-flesh core. The medium-weight palate offers ample acidity that lifts the rich fruit tones, with a lingering note of spiced citrus on the close.",South Africa-Western Cape-Sauvignon Blanc
"Partially aged in oak, this wine is crisp, juicy and bright with citrus and acidity. Apples and pears come through strongly in this attractive wine that is ready to drink.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"An all-purpose red wine, blending seven different grapes into a fruit bowl of forward berry flavors. Nothing challenging here, but the fruit is tasty and it might be compared to a nice Beaujolais—chill it and drink it outdoors on a hot summer day.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This is the inaugural release for Browne Family Chardonnay. Crisp and leesy, it has a smooth, creamy midpalate, with a buttered toast highlight. Refreshing acidity and excellent length keep it fresh and lively.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Key-lime rinds, pink grapefruit, crisp pluot, just-ripe pineapple, nectarine and a steely gunmetal aroma show on the nose of this bottling. There's an intriguing touch of sweet onion to the sip. The laser-sharp precision would pair well with shellfish, but a slightly buttered warmth makes the bottling quite versatile.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A Blanc de Noirs made exclusively from Pinot Noir always has a feeling of weight and richness. This is no exception, full-bodied in character, with rich pink grapefruit and green plum flavors. The bottling is still young and will benefit from bottle aging until 2016.",France-Champagne-Pinot Noir
"The characteristic 2014 acidity makes a lovely lemony splash in the center of this dry, refreshing wine. Lemon freshness rises from the glass, offering lots of verve and a lip-smacking finish.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"With reverberating notes of crushed stone, this dry rosé, made predominantly from Pinot Noir, suggests a more mineral expression of rosé. The palate offers delicate raspberry and cherry flavors and a surprisingly plump mouthfeel that clings nicely through the finish.",US-New York-Rosé
"Full, ripe and lusty, this has notes of licorice and grit on the bouquet. It feels fresh and lively, with enough richness and weight for balance. It tastes of balsamic-infused berry and spice, with an integrated herb note peeking through.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Sawdust, oak and grilled rosemary aromas lead the nose. Lacking fruit richness, the lanky palate instead displays espresso, licorice and cured salami flavors, while bracing tannins grip the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Plush and elegant dried purple flower, baked black fruit, graphite and char aromas show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is full of flavors that range from rich black currant to lively anise and cedar. Quite tasty and complex all around.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A rustic, everyday Cabernet, with enough blackberry and oak flavors to pass. It's rough in the mouth, with jagged tannins and an ashy note that's weird.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"With fruit sources split between Wallula and Canyon Vineyard Ranch vineyards, this off-dry (3.6 g/L residual sugar), enjoyable Pinot Gris is medium bodied with notes of lime, pineapple and petroleum jelly.",US-Washington-Pinot Gris
"Light fruit suggests strawberries with a slightly green edge. The tannins are still a bit rough and tumble, with a peppery kick.",US-Washington-Sangiovese
"Complicated scents of bacon, wet leather, organ meats and damp dirt open this funky wine from Santa Barbara County pioneer Richard Longoria. On the palate, the forest floor and gaminess persist alongside heavy herbal notes, a unique muskiness and smooth but present tannins.",US-California-Tempranillo
"This Champagne is soft with ripe red fruits and a gentle acidity. It is an immediately attractive wine, with an orange-tang aftertaste. The bottling is ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Plum, French oak, coffee, vanilla and Oriental spice aromas emerge in the glass. The concentrated palate offers mature black cherry, blackberry jam, vanilla and licorice alongside fine-grained tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"A firm, dense wine, it currently shows plenty of dry tannins along with potentially ripe fruits. Already showing balance, it is developing into a complex, rich wine that will be full of black fruits and smoother tannins. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of green olive, grilled asparagus, moist peat, mineral and coffee meld with earthy funk. The smoke and savory flavors are lithe yet concentrated, lingering on the finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This is high in alcohol, but it will easily pair with barbecue. It's made from fruit grown in the warm Larner Vineyard in Santa Ynez Valley as well as from the cool Lafond Vineyard in Santa Rita Hills. Rich, dry and complex, it offers brisk, citrusy acidity to offset the ripe blackberry, currant and sandalwood flavors.",US-California-Syrah
"Waxy, dusty aromas of stone fruits and honey are typical of Garnatxa Blanca, although this contains 30% Viognier as well. A citrusy, direct palate with cutting acidity sets up lemon, tangerine and green-apple flavors. Only on the finish does this taste mildly yeasty and slightly buttery.",Spain-Catalonia-White Blend
"Made with 95% Sangiovese and 5% Canaiolo, this brawny red opens with aromas of black-skinned fruit, violet and baking spice. The robust but polished palate doles out juicy red cherry, plum, cinnamon, mocha and vanilla while fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2023.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"The most immediately accessible of Will's three Horse Heaven Hills wines, it brings notes of scorched earth, herbs, incense, toast and abundant dark fruit. The palate is densely packed with dark fruit, tart acids and firm, tightly coiled tannins with a beautiful sense of balance. A classically styled wine that should have a healthy life in front of it.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Opens with warm, baked black fruit aromas and then a wave of woodiness takes control. The palate is round, full and sticky, with beefy but generic black fruit flavors and too much oak. Finishes with vanilla and resin; not a bad wine but needs more balance and fruit.",Argentina-Other-Pinot Noir
"With black currant fruits dominant, this is an inherently fruity wine. The juicy feel makes the wine seem light, not yet quite connecting between fruit and a very dry tannic texture. Give it until 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine is ripe, packed with tropical fruit and rich acidity. A hint of vanilla has rounded the wine out, giving a full body to the delicious fruitiness. Opulent and generous, it is kept in order by final, aromatic acidity. Drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"90-92 Concentrated, structure, a wine that pushes power and density. The year's acidity adds the necessary freshness. Impressive.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Subtlety and reserve drive this full-bodied, round-textured white Rhône-style blend. The velvety mouthfeel is almost more notable than the subdued pear, melon and butter flavors. It's a wine for lingering over, because it reveals its best stuff after time in the glass. It leads with 49% Marsanne, plus Viognier, Roussanne and Grenache Blanc.",US-California-White Blend
"Chunky, broad and slightly rubbery smelling, with baked aromas, leather and other more serious scents. The palate is full-bodied and warm, but not all that complex. Flavors of baked plums, cassis and licorice are nice, and the finish brings chocolate brownie into the game. For immediate drinking.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"An elegant, restrained, yet lovely Pinot Noir from a much-maligned vintage. Soft, round cherry fruit is wrapped in sandalwood and mocha flavors. Fully ripe with fine tannins and lovely integration of the barrel notes.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Delicate aromas of red rose and wild berry lead the nose while the taut palate offers raw sour cherry, anise, cinnamon and mocha. Bracing tannins lead to a firm, drying finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"From a small estate of only 10 acres, this wine with its 60% Merlot is fruity with just the right amount of tannins. It has red fruit and crisp acidity along with a dry edge. The wine is likely to age quickly, so drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Superripe in raspberries and cherries, with a strong coating of sweet, smoky oak, this Pinot Noir is a little lacking in subtlety. But it has excellent acidity, minerality and even some firm tannins, and that structure gives it elegance. A bit brusque now, but will be fascinating to watch it develop over the next six years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"91-93. Barrel sample. Big, bold and fruity, this shows plenty of rich blackberry-juice flavor and fine tannins. The fruit and tannins are well balanced, with a juicy character on the finish.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This ambitious debut from Argyle's founding winemaker is the first sparkling wine to be released under his own Roco label. Rollin Michael Soles crafted this classic blend of two-thirds Pinot Noir and one third Chardonnay from three Willamette Valley vineyards. It's a young, tart wine that's still a bit leesy, with precisely defined apple and citrus fruit. Retasted after being open for 24 hours it had just begun to expand and reveal the promise locked away in the bottle. Drink 2020–2030.",US-Oregon-Sparkling Blend
"This dry Riesling boasts intense apricot, yellow peach, citrus and smoky mineral sensations. The rich but polished palate is restrained by crisp acidity that leaves the mouth feeling fresh and clean.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Riesling
"Full, rich and on the dry side, this is loaded with ripe berry flavors, and it has a core of firm tannins and a touch of acidity. It finishes dry.",Portugal-Port-Port
"From a winery that only started operations in 2001, one of the new wave in the Alentejo. This Reserva is in a modern, smooth style, big and powerful. But there's one welcome wrinkle in all this smooth fruit, and that is a dash of Cabernet Sauvignon which gives just the right amount of tannins and interestingly fresh acidity.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"An oak-fermented blend of 90% Grenache Blanc and 10% Viognier, this is a full-bodied, richly textured wine for drinking over the near term. Nutty scents and flavors accent grilled peach and pineapple fruit, ending in a long, mouthwatering finish.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style White Blend
"A full, dominantly spicy wine, with ripe caramel and apples and freshness. It is a bright, lively wine, which keeps good weight and concentration.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"A blend of international grapes—Cabernet Franc, Syrah and Merlot (hence its name, Wide World)—this is a big, rich wine. The fruit ripeness balances with the prominent toasty wood flavors, giving a style that is smooth and polished. Black fruits dominate, the fruit tannins melding well with the wood. It's worth aging, though, over 3–4 years. Screwcap.",Austria-Burgenland-Red Blend
"This wine is half Viognier, with the balance Roussanne (35%) and Marsanne. The aromas of wild flowers, pear, peach, almond and grape skin lead to sweet full-feeling stone fruit notes that are quite flavorful. It shows a pleasing sense of balance.",US-Washington-Rhône-style White Blend
"Ripe bold Merlot creates a wine that has spice, juicy black-plum flavors and a core of tannin. It is a young wine, full of fruit, with a soft aftertaste. It was made to be drunk from early 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Tastes brittle and aloof in its youth, with a very dry mouthfeel dominated by acidity and tannins, although the texture is silky and smooth. You don't want to open this too soon. Given the core of cherries and pomegranates, it should develop, but no guarantees. The Freestone area is very cool and its possibilities are unknown but promising.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Rich and rounded, the wine has classic power. Wood flavors show strongly at this stage in its development, but it is full, ripe, full of yellow fruits, pineapple and apple skins. The wine has great weight, but offers a fresh, straight and crisp aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This very fine effort may well be the best yet from Saffron Fields and consulting winemaker Tony Rynders. Cola, smoke, black cherry and cinnamon scents explode from the glass, and the mouthwatering palate continues along those lines. It's got the balance, length and crisp, defining acidity to continue to drink well through 2021 or longer.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Lots of oak and ripe fruit in this flashy Cabernet. Too much of both, in fact. Explodes in blackberries, cassis, buttered toast and caramel, wrapped into the ripest, sweetest tannins imaginable. But beyond the obvious palate flattery, there's not a whole lot going on.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Priorat-like blend of 50% Grenache, 28% Syrah, and 22% Mourvèdre is pungent and spicy, with a bit of menthol in the nose. Supple and luxurious fruit, a mix of raspberry and black fruits, baking spices, sweet barrel flavors. Powerful and rich, this is a big wine with tobacco and clove highlights and a little heat in the finish.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Everything about this full-bodied and well-proportioned wine is rich: the spicy, chocolaty aromas from American oak barrels, the vivid boysenberry flavors, the fine but tannic texture and the lingering finish. Yet it all stays balanced, appetizing, palate-cleansing and fresh.",US-California-Petit Verdot
"Salty and savory, this unfiltered wine conveys a lot of wet stone and petrol character. The dark golden color reveals its time in oak. Concentrated and full-bodied, with rich layers of baked apple and pear, it shows a complexity on the palate and a depth of lingering fruit and ginger on the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"90—92 Barrel sample. Vibrantly fruity wine that shows freshness. It has lift, fresh blackcurrants, layers of acidity, while the tannins hide in the background.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This luxury-level project by Jeff Tanner and Rob DaFoe delivers aromas of rich blackberry jam nuanced with wet tobacco, loam, tomato leaf and a touch of spearmint. Blackberries and blueberries also line the edges of the palate, but the core is all about spicy tobacco and black pepper. There's lot of acidity four years in, so this will stand the test of time in the cellar. Drink 2017 through 2028.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
Apple notes play with citrus overtones on this superfresh and light wine. This is a summer wine with great refreshment potential: light and lifted with spritzy citrus.,Austria-Südsteiermark-Sauvignon Blanc
"This Port was bottled unfiltered which means there are the right conditions for it to age. It is rich and dense with jammy black fruits and ripe tannins. Dried black plums and dates are backed up by a dry core and by fine acidity. Drink this rich wine now, but it will be much better from 2019.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Whiffs of talcum powder and orange blossom perfume this bright, brisk wine. Crisp white peach and melon flavors are penetrating on the palate, finishing on a clean, slightly mineral tone. Drink now through 2017.",US-New York-Sauvignon Blanc
"The nose on this Negroamaro is rather closed but it eventually reveals toast, espresso and dried plum. The palate offers steeped plum, dried blackberry, coffee and nutmeg alongside firm tannins.",Italy-Southern Italy-Negroamaro
"Cherry and cassis notes provide a touch of brighness on the nose and palate of this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Cabernet Franc, 26% Petit Verdot and 6% Malbec, but its plum-raisin backdrop and dullness on the finish suggest it might be going downhill.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon/Malbec blend is balanced with attractive juicy acidity and red berry flavors, leaving a perfumed aftertaste. As a light wine to drink young, this Carreau family wine is attractive.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Pristine apple, pear and peach are marked with hints of nuts and crushed stones in this sprightly yet deeply complex auslese. It's lacy and sheer on the palate, yet lime and lemon tones are bracing. Hold till 2020 to allow the subtleties to intensify.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"A fresh, fruity lemon and pink grapefruit flavored wine, this is brightly full of acidity; a crisp and mineral texture creates a refreshing character. Ready to drink.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese White
"This new release from a great vintage for Chardonnay in Champagne is a perfect blanc de blancs, showing a wealth of intensity from the crisp, chalky, mineral tones to the perfumed apple notes. The aromas hint at developing toastiness that adds depth and complexity. The wine is still young and it will age for years. Drink from 2020.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"Smooth, velvet texture seem to leave the freshness on one side. It's delicious, like drinking a sweet soft drink but with real fruit and natural sugar. The botrytis is present on this unusual red TBA, but sweetness overwhelms everything.",Austria-Burgenland-Zweigelt
"Harsh, fruitless aromas of green bean and ashtray come before a raw palate that's far from welcoming. Choppy, herbal plum flavors are grassy, while the finish offers nothing new or different.",Chile-Curicó Valley-Carmenère
"The best blend from JM Cellars is Tre Fanciulli, here composed of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot, and 14% Syrah. You'll find pleasing strawberry and Bing cherry fruit, along with claret-like structure and nicely applied cinnamon and baking spice accents. It could almost fool you into thinking you were drinking an excellent Dry Creek Zinfandel.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Blackberry syrup, loamy soils and light mint show on the nose of this bottling by self-made vintners Don and Jennifer Arndt. There is a tense and tarry tannic structure to the sip, with deep and brooding flavors of blackened purple fruit most prominent.",US-California-Merlot
"This vintage is light in color with perfumed fruit and attractive red currant and orange fruit. It is floral, touched by raspberries as well as a strong streak of acidity. This refreshing wine is ready to drink.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This opens with aromas of toast, coffee, chopped herb and a whiff of cellar floor. The straightforward palate offers dried cherry, licorice and a hint of orange zest alongside firm tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling, which includes a bit of the other main Bordeaux varietals, shows concentrated blueberries, blackcurrant, cola and fudges notes on the nose. It's soft and rich on the palate, with fine-grained tannins revealing more dense, dark fruit, touches of mint and chocolate, and a nice floral component.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This delicious, sweet and fruit-driven wine smells like pineapple and honey. It tastes full bodied, very ripe and unctuous, and has a long, lingering finish. It will be great with salty cheeses and toasted nuts.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A lovely wine, rich and balanced and crisp, that shows how sometimes an offbeat blend can be better than a varietal wine. Made from Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer and Viognier, it's deliciously off-dry. Each variety brings something to the table, resulting in a whole that's superior to its parts.",US-California-White Blend
"Lush aromatics instantly alert you that this is an exceptional year for this vineyard. Aged in half new French oak, the wine takes it in stride, as it is dense with spicy red berry and plum flavors, and beautifully balanced throughout. Streaks of coffee and nut butter add to the compelling complexity, even at such a young age.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This fresh and easy Sicilian white is a blend of Insolia, Grecanico and Catarratto with easy citrus and stone fruit aromas. Pair it with Chinese chicken salad.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"This has a creamy consistency, and flavors of lemon custard and vanilla-cream. There is a dash of baking spices as well, but the fruit flavors are front and center.",US-Oregon-Pinot Blanc
"Smoky, oaky, charred flavors of savory plum and berry lead to a full, layered palate with slightly abrasive tannins. This tastes of grilled beef, lemon peel, toast, cassis and chocolate. A toasted character remains on a solid finish. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"With Pinot Noir, the magic trick is to have it taste sweet and ripe, and yet to finish bone dry. Few wineries in California accomplish this as regularly as Hanzell, and here they come again, with this wonderful 2008. It's entirely consistent with their past history, being dry, a little tannic and tantalizingly rich in cherry, raspberry and cola fruit. Enjoyable now, with decanting, and should develop in the cellar over the next dozen years if not longer, based on the winery's track record.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Intensely ripe plum and blackberry flavors contrast dusty mineral tones and scintillating acidity in this Cabernet Sauvignon. It's sharper and more angular than Paumanok's Tuthill's Lane bottling, but has an austerity and elegance that's captivating. Its fine firm tannins are edgy still, but should yield beautifully over the next decade.",US-New York-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sweet, thick and plump, this Morellino Riserva shines. It shows thick layers of cherry, blackberry, leather and spice. Pair it with pasta shells stuffed with ricotta and spinach.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"One of the top, if not the top, red wines from Umbria. The naturally tannic Sagrantino grape is softened by the careful oak aging that adds layers of chocolate and spice to the grape's aromas of black cherry, tobacco and leather. This is bold, powerful, masculine and velvety on the finish. Pair it with stewed or grilled meat marinated in rosemary and garlic. Age this in a cellar for 10 years or longer.",Italy-Central Italy-Sagrantino
Rustic aromas are followed by rough-edged fruitiness in this young wine. It has ripe berry fruits as well as some firm tannins in the background. It is not yet integrated and needs to develop much more. Drink from 2018.,Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This wine is very young, still with layers of wood. It is going to be a structured, dense and packed with a strong mineral texture. To contrast, generous red plum fruits and intense acidity are ready to convey a deep, rich character. Drink this impressive wine from 2019",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"The sweetness of this wine is well contained by acidity, with spice, lemon and honey flavors. It has fine fruit, a crisp texture and a feeling of lightness. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Chopped herb, forest floor, leather, espresso and a balsamic note are some of the aromas that waft out of the glass. The powerfully structured palate delivers prune, dried cherry, tobacco, and roasted coffee bean framed in firm fine-grained tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink to capture the fruit richness. Drink 2018–2023.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Aromas suggesting mature dark-skinned berry, French oak, leather, menthol and parched soil come together on this. The round, dense palate is already accessible, offering fleshy black cherry, licorice, cured meat and espresso alongside ripe, chewy tannins. Drink through 2021.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Aromas of toasted oak, espresso, vanilla and ripe berry lead the nose. The palate offers oak extract, roasted coffee bean, mocha and dark cherry. It's full-bodied, with drying and rather fleeting tannins.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"Decent, but unbalanced. Shows nice aromas of citrus, gooseberry and vanilla, but then turns frankly sweet in the mouth, with sugary flavors of lemonade and pineapple juice.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Despite showing reduced black plum and blackberry aromas, this displays grippy tannins and tension on the palate. Its blackberry and boysenberry flavors are lush, and the oak is mild and integrated on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro
"A wine that is so soft, its texture only just brushes the palate. White fruits and lemon juice give a gentle, balanced character that is light and quite ready to drink.",Portugal-Península de Setúbal-Portuguese White
"Chewing gum, dry wood and generic berry aromas precede an honest palate with modest tannins. Slightly herbal black-fruit flavors are peppery but nonspecific. A steady but chunky finish is the final act.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Great execution and delivery: This lively Brut layers on stone fruit, floral and mineral tones in well-measured doses. The mouthfeel is creamy and soft, gliding over the palate in an attractive and refreshing way.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"Produced from 60-year-old vines, with some new wood aging, this complex, ripe wine has an intense structure, with layers of vanilla and spice. The crisp nature of Sauvignon Blanc adds brightness to the ripe roundness. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"A pure Petite Sirah from 36-year-old vines grown in decomposed granite soil, this Cedarville bottling is appropriately purple-black in color, and rich with milk chocolate and licorice flavor. It's soft with juicy tannins, and boasts a long, luxurious finish. It'll sit quietly in the cellar for 10–15 years, if not longer, a commanding study in the evolved beauty of Petite Sirah.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"A rare example of the sweet wines of Sainte-Foy, this is more semisweet than super sweet. As such, it has attractive apple and custard flavors in a creamy texture lifted by vanilla and lightened by fresh green plum acidity.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Delicate scents of cut grass, fresh hay and whiff of tomato open on this vibrant wine. The bright, linear palate tastes of yellow grapefruit, green melon and citrus and offers up a lively acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"Smells like a shootout in a tomato factory. It's a strong whiff of tomatoes on the vine, followed by tannin and a little sweet, grapy fruit.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A super-delicious candy bar of a wine, with melted blackberry jam, milk chocolate and cassis liqueur flavors, sprinkled with black pepper and star anise. There's a brown sugar quality, but the finish actually is dry. Great price for a wine held back long enough by the producer to begin to soften and mellow. Drink now–2018.",US-California-Syrah
"Produced from old Pinot Noir vines, this wine shows attractive age as well as balanced fresher fruitiness. This well-made cooperative wine is ripe while also crisp and fresh. Apples and white currants come together with a steely texture to give a wine that could age in bottle.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This is a big, voluptuous Pinot, solidly in the Garys' style, but it possesses a delicate silkiness despite the size. In its extreme youth, the wine is all primary fruit and oak, with flavors of cherries, black raspberries, red licorice, cola and smoky vanilla. It feels broad and obvious, in the way of a young wine. However, 1-3 years in the bottle should bring out complexity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Like almost all of Reverie's Cabernets on release, this one needs time in the cellar. Tasted in fall 2011, it's tight and grapey, with blackberry jam flavors girded by a firm, stony minerality and sweet, but hard, tannins. Give it 6–8 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Villa Maria's upper-level Pinot Noirs have always been big and bold, but with this release the wines seem to have taken a turn toward more finesse and elegance. The 2010 Cellar Selection features a plushly textured palate, refined aromas and flavors of cherries, earth and cedar, and a long, softly dusty finish. Drink now–2018.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"Slightly fiery and hot on the nose, but there's enough berry, cherry and dusty leather to keep it positive. The palate is more sheer and sharp than expected, with piercing raspberry, razor's edge acidity and only a touch of back-end sweetness. Juicy but short and searing.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"This comes across as so light, friendly and easy to drink that one almost forgets to note the outstanding purity of fruit. Fresh cherries and blueberries present themselves honestly. Silky tannins and a spicy aftertaste suggest that it took top-quality fruit and lots of experience to make something so deceptively simple.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Zweigelt
"Apricot and peach fruits dominate this creamy, soft wine. It's smooth, lightly toasty and ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Chocolate, a hint of mint, spice and black fruit make this a true-smelling Syrah. The flavors run a little bit red, i.e. raspberry and red plum, and the finish offers a smack of oak along with dried fruit flavors. More of an acid-based, lively style.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Syrah
"Modern day Romans love their Frascati wines and employ them nightly to wash down fried sardines, steamed artichokes or their favorite pasta dishes. This expression is crisp, clean and redolent of apricot, pear and melon.",Italy-Central Italy-White Blend
"Grillo tends to oxidize easily during winemaking. Timpune does in fact show distant aromas of butterscotch and caramel that fit squarely within the aromatic profile of the grape. Otherwise, the wine ends with fresh peach, citrus and pineapple.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Grillo
"Tulpen's 2009 Cabernet moves the fruit sources to a trio of Walla Walla vineyards, notably Tokar and Heather Hill, to good effect. It's pure varietal, and the excellent fruit sources yield a muscular, aromatic, dense wine. Floral top notes lead into spicy, brambly black fruits. The tannins are firm and astringent, leaving just a bare suggestion of ripe raisins in the finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Named after the quail that inhabit the vineyard, this intensely fruity wine is ripe and full-bodied. Flavors of truffles, spice as well as black plums and berries abound. This is a serious wine for aging; keep for at least seven years, although with its great fruit it could be deliciously drinkable sooner.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"88-90 The wine seems to have over-ripe fruit, giving it an unbalanced feel. It does have weight, the tannins offering some structure, while it's the acidity that really gives the wine shape.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Wet slate minerality leads the brisk, tightly wound nose. On the palate, the wine is a bit perfumed, at least for how tight the nose is, with elements of crisp apple, pear and a touch of nectarine.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Typical varietal aromas of black-skinned berry, blue flower a spice note waft out of the glass. The straightforward, easygoing palate conveys mature black cherry, raspberry jam and a light note of ground pepper alongside soft, round tannins. Simple but well made, it makes an ideal quaffing wine.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"Packaged in a plain, stylish bottle with the RR logo prominently displayed, this reserve-level cuvée brings concentrated flavors of citrus, apple, peach and pear, along with highlights of wet paper, fresh herb and lemongrass. Despite 12 g/L of residual sugar, the finish tilts a bit sour.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Ripe plum, tilled earth, violet, espresso and toast aromas waft out of the glass. The palate offers dried black cherry, mocha and roasted coffee bean alongside fleeting tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This is rich and appealing now for its ripe flavors of raspberry and cherry that taste as if they were baked in a sweet, smoky pie crust. The acidity provides a pleasant tartness. It should age well over the next 3–5 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine begins with aromas that recall red peppers, black berries and spice with a whiff of grilled sage. The palate offers ripe black cherry and plum accented with white pepper and cinnamon-spice and thyme. It still has youthful, aggressive tannins that need a few more years to soften. Drink 2016–2021.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Aromas of vanilla extract, cinnamon, fennel and fruit leather predominate on this Syrah and Merlot-dominant blend. The palate shows a surprising amount of richness considering the coolness of the vintage, with baking-spice flavors carrying through the finish.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc, 10% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot opens with aromas of blackberry, cedar and cooking spice. On the palate, notes of bell pepper, espresso, toast and black pepper accent a firm black cherry core. Drink through 2017.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Light aromas of vanilla, coconut, exotic spices and blue fruit are followed by plump, tart fruit flavors and firm, somewhat astringent tannins. There are a lot of good things going on but the tannins need to be tamed.",US-Washington-Tempranillo
"Sweet and fiery on the nose, with piercing aromas that burn right up your nasal passages. The palate is pinched and super tannic, with biting flavors of black licorice, blackberry and cola. Could be better with a softer, smoother mouthfeel but seeing that this is an '04 with six years behind it, it isn't going to soften up much.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Former Cloudy Bay boss Kevin Judd scores big in this challenging vintage. The wine is round, ripe and amply concentrated, with grassy, herbal shadings and pineapple and stone fruit notes that linger on the lush finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"As befits a reserve wine, this blend was aged in wood for six months. That has given a ripe lightly toasty character to the wine along with its cool crispness that reveals its origin in the mountainous northern Alentejo. The wine is fruity with lemon and melon over the wood. Drink now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese White
"Nambrot (a Bordeaux-inspired blend) is characterized by thick density and ripe fruit flavors of blackberry, plums and dried currants. The mouth is firm and solid and the wine has thick, drying tannins and a very long finish. This is a beautifully evolved and elegant wine.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This is a high-toned, structured wine with vibrant acidity that is layered in earth, spice, raspberry and black tea. After a medium-sized weight to the midpalate, it finishes soft and round.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Sumptuous, ripe and very full on the palate, this wine is dense and packed with notes of botrytis that give a strong sense of structure. This well-balanced wine shows potential to age, offering rich acacia honey and beautiful final acidity. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Shows little of the structure or finesse you expect from a Santa Maria wine. Instead, it's soft and fruity to the point of overripe, with jammy berry and pepper flavors that veer into stewed prunes.",US-California-Syrah
"The nose of this luminous sparkler focuses on honey, acacia flower and a hint of almond nut. The bubbling is steady and direct, leaving soda-like effervescence in the mouth with little creaminess.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"92-94 Barrel sample. This is a dark, firm, strongly tannic but impressive wine, with a dry core of dark fruits. They open slowly to reveal a rich undertow of blackberry jelly fruit flavors.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Clear and light in color and texture, this offers an inviting floral and citrus bouquet, while the palate flirts with Asian five-spice and black cherry. While the fruit is compelling, the structure is undefined and the finish a tad flat.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A nice Russian River Pinot from Green Valley, it is marked by berry-earthy flavors, firm tannins and supportive acids, and is very dry. The particular flavors are of cherries with a rich streak of sweet tobacco and herbs. Marked by a bouyancy of texture and a silkiness that glides over the palate, although it finishes quick and may not be an ager.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Bob Lindquist may be the only winemaker in California who knows how to make Marsanne in a compelling way, and his only grow more fascinating with each passing vintage. This shows dried apple, light melon, sweet chamomile and tangy lime juice on the nose. Racy acidity and tactile tension show on the palate, with light stone fruit and citrus flavors that will intensify with time in bottle. Drink 2018–2030.",US-California-Marsanne
"This is drinking very well; there's a little Merlot and Petit Verdot too in the blend. It's plummy and open, a little loose-knit in the core but soft and approachable. Wrapped into the tart fruit are streaks of licorice and tar, with light loamy tannins.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dense mossy aromas of blackberry are slightly murky. Forget about delicacy on the palate, this is full-bodied and clattering. Blackberry, cassis, black cherry and chocolate flavors finish spicy. This is at maximum ripeness. Drink through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"With its strong initial impression of dryness, this is obviously a structured wine. It is dense, rich and concentrated with fine tannins, spice and a strong orange-zest character. Refreshing acidity gives a lift to this ripe, full wine. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon blend is ripe with attractive vanilla flavors from the wood aging that complement the red berry fruits. It is spicy, toasty and has a soft structure. Give it time for the wood to allow the fruit more space, but it will be a generous wine.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This shows real Sauvignon character in its brisk, mouthwatering acidity. Its green grass and gooseberry notes accompany riper lemon and lime fruit.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This well built wine boasts tart cherry fruit and citrusy acidity. That lemony character carries through the finish, adding lift and mouth-cleansing astringency.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This wine has so many of the structural elements of a Saint-Estèphe, but also is enveloped by ripe fruitiness. Black in color and dense in character, it has sweetness from the plum juice fruits and great acidity. But it is also firm, powerfully projecting a serious potential. Drink from 2022.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Luscious honey, marmalade and grapefruit perfume bursts from the glass of this bristling Silvaner eiswein. The palate is almost cloudlike in its delicacy yet lavishly creamy too, dusted by lingering hints of mineral, earth and umami. It's delicious already but structured enough to improve over the next decade.",Germany-Franken-Silvaner
"Aromas of molasses, wood grain, blackberry and cassis are alluring. Bright, bold and energetic across the palate, this Crianza from a warm, dry year offers toasty oak, chocolate, spice, licorice and black-fruit flavors. As it moves towards the finish, toasty, blackened notes along with hints of mocha rise up. Drink from 2018–2028.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This Pinot is too tart and tannic to drink now, though it has great potential. You have to search for the fruit, but it's there, in deeply hidden layers of cherries and red currants. Dry and stubborn now, but don't give up. It will reward cellaring for a minimum of six years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A healthy wine with plenty of oak. On the nose, it's charred as well as fruity, with raspberry and plum aromas blending with vanilla. Feels tight and grippy, with dry oak, herbal flavors and fresh red berry and tomato. Finishes clean and snappy, with correct weight and length. Drink now through 2013.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"New management, farming and winemaking practices at this producer, including a focus on smaller production, are remarkably on display in this delicious white. Golden pear and crunchy apple provide an unctuous, delightfully balanced experience that's crisp in underlying acidity and subtle baking spice.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Charred on top and showing roasted berry aromas underneath. This wine sizes up as a plump, round berry ball with low-to-medium acidity and soft tannins. It's just mildly herbal and rooty, with a soft finish. It flows smoothly and won't cause any eyebrows to be raised. Drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend

"Hot, stalky aromas of red chili flake and weedy raspberry lead to a lean, tomatoey palate with flavors of tomato, dried berry, vanilla and especially dill weed. A saucy, woody finish confirms that this is now mostly oak and acid; drink through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Rounded and fruity, the wine has caramel, ripe red fruits and a touch of tannins. It's dry, although it's not as fresh as it should be, more ripe and full in the mouth. Drink in 2014.",France-Loire Valley-Rosé
"This 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot wine is ripe and spicy. Solid fruit gives a juicy character along with a strong sense of structure. That allows room for plenty of acidity as well as fruit, but also demands aging to allow the mineral texture to soften. Along with owner Monique Bonnet's Château Suau, this vineyard was certified French organic with the 2012 vintage. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This ripe, spicy blend of Niellucciu and Grenache has a rich while also fruity character. The tannins are generous, warm and allow the fruit and acidity to express themselves. It will be ready to drink from 2017.",France-France Other-Red Blend
"Medium bodied, this wine has a loose-feeling entrance, but zesty acids quickly surface and invigorate the palate. The flavors of tropical fruit, nectarine and white strawberry are appealing, but they would benefit from increased concentration and focus. Try pairing this easy quaffer with light poultry-based dishes and simple preparations of white fish.",US-Virginia-Viognier
"Very rich and sumptuous, if a little heavy. It's delicious and complex, with cherry, mocha and red currant flavors that finish sweet and spicy. You'll experience a hit of tannins that provides structure, but makes the wine slightly unaccessible. Aging is a gamble, given a certain pruniness on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This Tuscan blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio opens with crisp, almost tart, tones of citrus, exotic fruit and honeydew. The wine shows substance in the mouth and enough heft to pair with tuna or chicken salad.",Italy-Tuscany-White Blend
"What a nice wine. It's so dry, acidically crisp, and so balanced, it puts many more expensive California Sauvignon Blancs to shame. There's no oak in this screwtopped wine, nothing to muck up the pure, fresh citrus and fig flavors. The winemaker has allowed high natural acidity to remain, which makes everything ultraclean and savory.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Lightly reduced aromas of pear, apple and herb lead to a bright, crisp, clean palate. The aromas don't all seem in harmony at present but the palate brings plenty of enjoyment.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"This is the winery's first release of this vineyard-designated wine. Cocoa, fresh herb, tire rubber and cherry aromas are followed by cassis flavors backed by tightly wound tannins.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Gemtree places a lot of emphasis on their growing practices, which is wonderful. The fruit, however, sometimes get masked by winemaking technique, and in this case the culprit is oak. The wine is rich and plush, with sweet potpourri spices, ripe blue and red fruit, and oregano, but the oak overpowers. Drink now–2025.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Distinct aromas of wood grain and pine crowd out any fruit scents. This feels somewhat flat, with resiny oak flavors resting on top of melony notes. A second wave of wood spice controls the finish.",Chile-Central Valley-Chardonnay
"A dry wine with mature white fruit and tight acidity, this wine will take time to coax out the rich, mineral character that hides within. It's touched with toast, but freshness and fruitiness dominate for a refreshing aftertaste.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"This boasts intense aromas of crushed thyme, new leather and a balsamic note of camphor. Firmly structured but elegant, the linear palate offers dried sour cherry, tobacco, clove and sage set against assertive, close-grained tannins. Drink 2021–2031.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Toast, espresso, oak and grilled herb aromas lead the nose while the palate offers dried black cherry, raw cranberry, orange zest and oak. Raspy tannins leave a bracing, drying finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Subdued aromas of dark-skinned berry, baking spice, truffle and leather slowly emerge in the glass. The chewy, delicious palate is more expressive, delivering juicy black cherry, raspberry jam, white pepper and a mineral note while firm, refined tannins provide youthful tension. Enjoy through 2020.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"Stalky and tannic, this wine's structure is balanced by red berry-fruit flavors. It is smoky, typical of Cabernet Franc, giving a young character that should broaden out. Drink this fruity while structured wine now, or better from 2016.",France-Loire Valley-Cabernet Franc
"This simple style of Marlborough Pinot delivers notes of bramble berry, licorice and cola on the nose, with a slightly more complex palate of dark cherry, mocha spice and dried leaves. The oak is a little prevalent throughout and texturally it's on the lean and mean side, but the fruit carries through until the end, keeping the gluggability factor up.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"Textured and beautifully balanced pear fruit shows glimpses of marzipan and candied peel on a palate guided by sheer, zesty citrus acidity.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"Very ripe, juicy pear notes emanate from the glass, but there is also a friendly tinge of yeast. The palate does both notions complete justice, delivering a refreshing but supple, peppery mouthful with a lovely, moreish and lip-smacking finish.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"Here's a food-fiendly and easy-going Prosecco Superiore (in a dry or Brut expression) that offers aromas of crushed mineral, stone fruit and fresh citrus. This sparkler feels focused and sharp in the mouth.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Ripe aromas of blueberry, acai fruit and grape candy get touched by smoked meat, crushed herbs and a slight mint. Leather and tar flavors emerge on the palate, but the fruits and spice characteristics are wound up in incredibly firm, mouth-drying tannins, which are overwhelming right now.",US-California-Syrah
"This is a finely made mix of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier grapes, light golden in color and dripping in marzipan, hazelnuts and baked bread. Complex and layered, it's got a depth of soul around zesty acidity, staying fleshy and full on the tongue.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"A penetrating mineral streak cuts through layers of honeyed peach and cantaloupe in this intensely concentrated, complex Spätlese. It's lip smacking and succulently sweet, yet balanced by a zesty citrus backbone that pulses long through the finish.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"A sizable percentage of Merlot is blended in here, as well as much smaller amounts of Petit Verdot, Zinfandel and Malbec. Together, they work, offering a lushness of blackberry jam and chocolate in a medium-bodied package that's smooth, with just the slightest tension of tannin and tobacco.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine suggests green, savory herbs along with cherry and currant. It's elegant in style, velvety in feel, and delivers good concentration to the fruit flavors plus barrel notes (20% new French) on the lingering finish. The variety gets lost with the herbal notes taking over, but it still offers enjoyment.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Ripe yellow and white fruits are the dominant factor in this smooth, rich wine. It has good weight, along with a juicy, lemon and zest texture. Not for aging, unlike some Pouilly Fumé, so drink over the next few months. Screwcap.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is exceedingly ripe tasting, with a syrupy texture. Along the way, you'll encounter tar and rubber aromas in front of flavors such as carob, vanilla and stewed berry fruits. A minty, oaky finish is the final weighty act.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Ripe, rounded, creamy wine, with sweet spice, but still with a reservoir of the freshest acidity. Green apple fruits add crispness, while the wine finishes in a golden afterglow. Screwcap.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"Made with 100% Schiava, this has a subdued nose that eventually reveals red berry and iris. The palate offers crushed raspberry and a hint of marzipan alongside somewhat drying tannins and brisk acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Schiava
"This juicy wine is ripe with black fruits cut with acidity. A firm tannic core sustains this rich fruitiness, giving the wine enough structure to age further. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"This blend of Castelão has benefited from its touch of Cabernet Sauvignon to give some tannins and structure. It is a ripe wine, full of red berries, plenty of spice and a crisp aftertaste of acidity. Drink the wine from 2018.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
"A very rich, dramatic, indisputably Napa Cabernet. The fruit is ripe in blackberries and cassis, the tannin structure is vibrant and living, and the oak application is superb. A fashionable Cab that should develop over the next eight years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Intense, focused and also quite floral on the nose, this blend of Malbec, Cab Sauvignon and the Italian variety Ancellotta is all about the fruit. Flavors of fig, blackberry and cassis ride nicely on a smooth, chewy palate. On the finish, this is layered, deep in feel and toasty in flavor. Drink this impressive, full-bodied blend now through 2018.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Vines situated in the heart of the village give this wine its ripe, generous berry flavor. The tannins, while firm, are integrated into the bold fruitiness. This round while structured wine has good acidity to balance the richness. Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"A soft wine, full of cherry preserve flavors, along with a bright, fresh waft of acidity. It is just spoilt by the banana flavor from the vinification.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Aromatic blueberry scents this wine on nose and palate. The body is light but vivid with white pepper and crunchy, fresh, vibrant fruit. This is St. Laurent picked at exactly the right point of ripeness: luscious but still bright! A real treat with its long, smooth finish.",Austria-Thermenregion-St. Laurent
"Scratchy, herbal aromas settle on tar, asphalt, tart red fruits and leather. The palate on this cutting Rioja is pushy and full of bold acidity, while oak and herbal berry flavors finish minty and spicy, with a ringing, acid-driven feel.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"The wine is rich and ready to drink. With red fruits and warm tannins, it is a ripe wine that has a light structure and balanced acidity. It is already an easy wine—fruity and soft at the end.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a very nice Riesling for drinking with today's ethnic fare. Although it's softer than you'd expect from this normally tart varietal, it's clean and spicy, with citrus, flower and honey flavors. The sweetness level is off-dry.",US-California-Riesling
"An exemplary rendition of the RR reserve bottling, this vintage is loaded with honey and spice. Smooth, off-dry, complex and full bodied, it's in perfect balance between sweetness and tang, mixing fruit and skin components with that succulence. Lively and energetic, it's delicious now but will benefit from age. Drink through 2030.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Blending fruit from four vineyards, this opens with dusty aromatics of rose petals, baking spices and cocoa. The mouthfeel continues in a pleasantly dusty vein, showing tart berry and pie-cherry flavors with a lick of mocha.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Criterion is a so-called global brand, offering Italian Pinot Grigio, Rioja and Chianti Classico among other benchmarks. This Coonawarra Cabernet is surprisingly good given that background. It offers cherry, cassis and tobacco notes, medium body and silky tannins. Drink it over the next 5–8 years.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This opens with notes of toasted walnut, yellow flower and orchard fruit. The fresh, elegant palate delivers yellow apple, mineral and bitter almond alongside bright acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Friulano
"From Verzenay on the Montagne de Reims this wine is rich, structured and concentrated. It has a rich texture plus spice as well as zesty orange and red-currant fruits. The wine retains some of the tannins of the red grapes although goes much more for a mineral texture. Drink now.",France-Champagne-Pinot Noir
"This wood-aged wine bases its smooth character on firm tannins as much as fruit. It has concentration, firm extraction and a hard edge.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a style of Pinot Noir that needs to be drunk chilled. It brings out the smoky, stalky character of the wine that dominates the bitter cherry fruits. It's still young and needs another year to come together.",France-Loire Valley-Pinot Noir
"With the extra years of aging, this wine has smoothed itself out. It has lost that instant freshness of a young Muscadet and gained riper yellow and spice flavors that give it a full, rich character. There's just the right amount of acidity at the end to finish on a crisp note. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"There's so much raspberry, cherry, cola, clove, cinnamon and pepper flavor in this wine, it's hard to know where to begin. It's also dry, with smoky, vanilla oak notes. Yet it lacks the vital structure a good Rhône blend wants in order to house all this richness. Drink now. Grenache-Syrah.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This wine is 76% Syrah, 15% Mourvèdre and 9% Grenache. Aromas of black fruit, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, raw meat and spice are followed by smooth black-coffee flavors. It lingers on the finish.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"You'll find lots of upfront blackberry, black currant, roasted meat and cedar flavors in this dry Malbec. It's a little soft, but easy to drink now, especially with beef.",US-California-Malbec

"At one moment there is a whiff of fresh apple, the next a hint of wet earth and orange peel. Brisk and dry, the palate also veers from rounded fruit to earthier, funkier notes. It finishes clean and refreshing.",France-Alsace-Alsace white blend
"Beautifully crafted to reflect a bouquet of cassis and cedar aroma, this wine blends in 6% Merlot, 1% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot. Girded by good bones a sturdy structure, it's bright, fresh and finessed. Drink now through 2020.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"From the producer's younger hillside blocks, this is comprised of 93% Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percents of Malbec and Merlot. Blackberry and cherry are warmly wrapped in a blanket of chocolate and clove, while easy acidity provides softness and approachability to the texture and body weight, which are voluptuous.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Dominated by its toasty wood flavors, this is a wine still under development. It has weight, the fruit offering great potential richness. Spice, lime fruits and a firm, steely core all promise to come together into a fine wine in five years.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This fresh, tangy wine (69% Sangiovese) smells like spicy oak, red cherries and raspberries and tastes equally bright and fruity. The texture is nicely lean, cleansing the palate with each sip, and it doesn't feel full bodied.",US-California-Red Blend
Aromas of hazelnut and mature yellow apple follow over to the no-frills off-dry palate along with a confectionery note. Crisp acidity and brisk bubbles provide a zesty backdrop.,Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Impronta (a blend of Insolia and Chardonnay from Sicily) offers floral fragrances that recall cut basil, acacia flower and honeysuckle. The wine is easy, crisp and light on the palate, making for a perfect summertime sipper.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"A nice debut from this new label under the Tendril umbrella. Intense in color and deep in flavor, this pure varietal rosé pushes forward raspberry and cherry fruit with plenty of juicy pizzazz. The back end revs up with a burst of citrus rind.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A nicely balanced Pinot Noir from an unlikely spot––Portola Valley, on the western side of Highway 280 across from Stanford University––and a newish small producer. It's on the bigger side of the Pinot spectrum but has admirable texture and cherry and earth aromas. Only 130 cases made. Worth trying to see what unconventional areas can do with the variety.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Phillips Hill's Two Terroirs is very subtly marked “AV + MR,” signaling that the fruit was sourced from both the cool Anderson Valley and even cooler Mendocino Ridge. It's lightly earthy and resplendent in bright, just-ripe cherry tones. Gorgeously crisp, with undeniable structure, this is ready to drink, but it would also shine in a few years time.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Nice to see such a nice Merlot from Château Julien, their best ever. It does what Merlot should, being dry and lush, with complex sour cherry, currant, herb, cocoa and spice flavors wrapped into smooth tannins. A lovely wine for drinking now.",US-California-Merlot
"There is some of the mineral character that is typical of the Douro in this black-fruit-laden wine. It has acidity and tannins and a stalky, juicy character that keeps it crisp. The wine is ready to drink now.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"There's nothing to dislike about the 30th anniversary release of this iconic Australian wine—only the price is hard to swallow. Cedar, earth and mint frame the nose, while the dark-fruit and rich cola flavors ease across the palate in a wave of creamy tannins. It even firms up a little on the finish; could age until 2020.",Australia-South Australia-Red Blend
"In much the same style as Brandborg's Riesling, this creamy Pinot Gris has a rich, leesy texture, here augmented with streaks of vanilla and toasted almond. The fruit is tangy and refreshing, tasting of ripe lemons and limes, and the balance and full midpalate show a fine winemaker at work.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Plum and cherry fruit show on the nose of this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot, 10% Malbec, 10% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot, but an iodine character adds a counterpoint to the fruit. Deep black fruit shows on the palate, meshing with savory spice and lifted by boisterous acidity.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Cut grass, tomato vine and gooseberry aromas almost jump out of the glass. The tangy, racy palate offers grapefruit, papaya, a light kiwi note and a hint of mineral alongside brisk acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"While sunny melon and peach flavors are forward and fruity, an underlining of chalky minerality lends finesse and elegance to this dry, neatly composed wine. It feels sprightly on the palate, finishing briskly on a lifted white-blossom note.",US-New York-Riesling
"This full-bodied, concentrated expression of Morellino opens with aromas of spiced plum, blueberry, mocha and a whiff of cake spice. The palate delivers wild cherry, blackberry, vanilla and savory herb alongside tightly knit, assertive tannins. Drink 2016–2021.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"One of the better examples of Sangiovese out there, in a difficult field. You have to credit the fine vineyard iocated in the emerging Ballard Canyon section of the valley. The acidity is brisk, as it tends to be in this variety, and the finish is thoroughly dry, with flavors of cherries and tobacco. Try as a lighter alternative to Zinfandel.",US-California-Sangiovese
"A blend of Chardonnay (70%) and Manzoni, this creamy white wine is redolent of yellow rose, stone fruit and vanilla cream. Pair it with spicy chicken curry or shellfish in butter sauce.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend
"Here's a real find: a serious-fun wine with lots going for it. Opens with black-cherry, smoke and vanilla aromas; rich and fine. The flavors are cherry-smoky and bone dry, with a fine texture. There's something distinguished and high quality about the structure and finish.",US-California-Syrah
"While the nose of this sprightly off-dry Riesling is floral and fresh, the palate is almost dense with ripe rich flavors of tropical mango, melon and orange. It's a lush deeply penetrating wine, yet feather-light in texture. The salty, mineral tang on the finish reverberates delightfully. Drink now through 2021.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"A ripe melon aroma follows through to a wine that is rich, open and generous. While it misses some freshness and acidity, its ripe, rounded fruit flavors are an enjoyable compensation. For short-term aging.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"A new label for MacMurray Ranch, this Pinot Gris is stony in fresh nectarine, pear and mango, wrapped in a creamy texture that develops fleshy flavors of fig in the glass. The fruit is sourced from both MacMurray Ranch and Gallo's cooler Russian River Valley outpost, Two Rock, near Petaluma.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"Minty and sharp in acidity, and not offering much richness now, especially at this price, although it does feel stylishly dry and elegant. Shows proper cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A fresh, green nose of grass, herbs and asparagus leads on this mouthfilling white. Flavors of citrus, tropical fruit and melon are punctuated by earthy spice and herbs. A lengthy aftertaste adds to the appeal. An interesting, distinctive Sauvignon Blanc.",South Africa-Western Cape-Sauvignon Blanc
"Cool, earthy aromas of wild berry, herbs and graham cracker set up an angular feeling palate with plenty of acidic pop. The flavor profile features reedy raspberry and plum flavors accented by bacon flavors, while the finish is long, narrow, firm in feel and a touch hot. Drink through 2019.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Not a bad wine but definitely overoaked for what it is. The nose bleeds resin and faux milk chocolate, while the chunky, herbal palate offers pretty good mouthfeel but also roasted berry flavors. Menthol and herbal notes rise up on the hot finish.",Chile-Maule Valley-Carmenère
"Squeezed plums and deep pomegranate extract gain some funky complexity from damp mushrooms, sour plum skins and wet wood on the nose of this bottling. The flavors are heavy with juniper, smoked pine and exotic woods, and the dried berry fruit compensates for the herbaciousness.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Densely tannic, this has edgy black currant flavor emerging between a firmly dry structure  packed with dark berry fruits and fresh acidity. This is light in fruit and heavy on tannins.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Although this Pinot is captivatingly rich in raspberry and cherry pie filling, red currant and Dr. Pepper cola flavors, it also has fine acidity and smooth, complex tannins, and a lovely overlay of sweet, smoky oak. Good as it is, there's no reason why it shouldn't develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This round, fruity and smooth-drinking Sémillon carries touches of herb and cucumber alongside its main fruit flavors of citrus and melon. There is a hint of heat on the finish.",US-Washington-Sémillon
"Here is a lovely, dry evocation of the spicy, fragrant grape, with a vibrant mix of peach, apricot and papaya fruit flavors. The floral aromatics are inviting and varietally appropriate, without becoming so perfumed that it makes food pairing a challenge.",US-Oregon-Gewürztraminer
"Led by Vincent Lacoste (the sixth generation), this is a rich wine, with smooth tannins and plenty of spice. The wood-aging flavors are already integrated into the generous black fruits and concentrated structure. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This blend of Roussanne, Chardonnay and Viognier is a wine of tremendous interest and complexity. While it's quite dry, it shows powerful flavors, but is not a bomb, with the voluptuous, flowery fruitiness retreating into firmer minerals in the finish. Sweet oak is present in the most exacting balance. An exciting experiment in control and verve from this distinguished winery.",US-California-White Blend
"This is big, muscular and very opulent, with its density lying over its minerality. Flavors of black stone fruits and red berries have the intensity of a powerful, age-worthy wine.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"The sites behind this wine range from near Rockpile to several of the Sangiacomo's vineyards in the southern part of Sonoma. Together they gel into a creamy, vanilla-laden experience, rich but not overly so, with plenty of ripe apple and pear.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This delightful rosso has enticing fragrances of violet, iris and red berry. The bright palate delivers wild cherry, white pepper and mint flavors framed by silky tannins. This is made to be drunk young, so enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"The aromas are surprisingly light for the variety with notes of ripe pear and peach. It's full bodied with sweet fruit flavors and a rounded, creamy feel leading to a warm finish.",US-Washington-Viognier
The superb Clos de la Roche has produced a powerful and complex wine. It has concentrated black fruits and solid tannins while also showing a beautiful velvet texture that will develop into a sumptuous wine. It's still in the first youthful flush and needs many years. Drink from 2020.,France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Cool briary plum and blackberry aromas show lactic, creamy oak, which is nothing unusual for Cobos. Plump, dense and saturated in the mouth, this block-selection Malbec is extremely ripe, with medicinal black fruit and raisiny flavors touched up by mocha and peppery spice. An oaky, spicy finish is par for the course. Drink through 2021.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Big and rich, powered with sweet fruits, rounded with black plums. The firm tannins are densely packed at the core of this ageworthy wine. With its swathes of ripe fruit and the edge of wood aging, it's already delicious, but keep for at least six years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A stablemate to the Richard's Cuvée, bottled under the winemaker's Matello label, this is a creamy, juicy wine with a lush mix of apple, pear and banana fruit flavors. There's a suggestion of mineral underlying the creamy mouthfeel, which adds an extra bit of freshness.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Green pear and ripe lemon are the chief aromatic markers on nose and palate of this slender, refreshing wine. This has a spring in its step and a whole lot of zesty, lemony freshness with an ultraclean finish.",Austria-Weinviertel-Grüner Veltliner
"Something of a curiosity in the Kracher range, this red grape-based, super-rich wine has preserved its tannins while having flavors of dried figs, spice and concentrated red berries. An intriguing wine, best with food.",Austria-Burgenland-Zweigelt
"Part of the same family business as Philippe Girard's wines (Benoît is his brother), this is a ripe, pure and clean wine. Perfumed acidity and zesty flavors are integrated into the rich green fruit. Apples and green plums dominate this refreshing wine that will develop. Drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Lemon and orange peel are right at the front of this wine. It's fruity, tangy and completely ready to drink.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Using grapes sourced from vineyards just outside of the Chablis region, this soft and white-fruited wine is attractive and fragrant. A touch of vanilla adds another dimension, lending a ripe feel. Ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Extravagantly floral on the nose, with blueberry, mineral and other particular aromas. But once you hit the palate, the acidity is extreme and thus the mouthfeel is sheering. Flavors of blueberry and mulberry are tangy, while the finish is angular. Too sharp and tangy to compete with the best, including Altamira and Bella Vista, Achaval-Ferrer's other single-vineyard big boys.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This Grand Cru is the smallest in the village of Morey Saint-Denis, located north of the village. This wine, produced from a tiny parcel, is immensely concentrated while also having the generous fruits that are typical of the village. It is full of juicy black fruits, fine tannins and a dark, firm aftertaste. Drink from 2023.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This 100% varietal wine was given two-and-a-half years in barrel, the majority of it new American oak. Smoky in character, it has a compressed and extracted feel, built around sizable punches of black plum, cedar, earth and coffee. It's big, but good.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"A multidimensional wine, this delicious example made from 130-year-old vines combines depth, breadth and length. It smells like ripe blackberries, tastes fruity and layered, feels luxurious and supple but at the same time firm in fine tannins and balanced by lively acidity. Medium to full bodied, it tastes great now and will improve through 2020.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Grassy and oily smelling and then you'll find a thick, oily palate with honey and lychee flavors. Not very zesty, so it's kind of clumsy and dense, with a chunky finish and bitterness. Decent acidity is what keeps its head above water.",Spain-Andalucia-Moscatel
"From a parcel that is outside the Premier Cru of Les Damodes, this is a structured, steely and mineral-textured wine. Firm tannins go with attractive perfumes and the potential of ripe, jammy fruit. The end has great acidity as well as a smoky character from wood aging. Drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Situated between the two mountain ranges of Saint-Baume and Sainte-Victoire, this estate is dry and relatively cool in the summer. That produces this fresh, lightly pink-colored wine that has a smooth caramel flavor and rich strawberry fruits. The aftertaste is soft and ripe.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Harbes' standard-label Merlot offers a plusher, more voluptuous expression of sun-kissed berries and cherries. Rich in body and textures, it's warmed by hints of Graham cracker and cinnamon and soft feathery tannins. Sunny cranberry acidity brightens the finish. Drink now through 2021 to enjoy its fruity forward nature.",US-New York-Merlot
"This waxy, heavily oaked Chardonnay regularly pulls the same score. This vintage has aromas of grapefruit, quince and garlic. Blasting oak and modest acidity result in flatness, while oak resin is by far the dominant flavor, with creamy apple and pithy bitterness lurking.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"Classic northern Rhône aromas of smoke, espresso and black olive set the stage, followed by layers of dark fruit and spice. The finish is softly dusty, brimming with plum and licorice notes. Full-bodied, concentrated and supple, this is ready to drink now, yet should age well through 2025 or so.",France-Rhône Valley-Syrah
"Fenestra's blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot is aromatically interesting with hints of Dr. Pepper and spice. The palate devolves with strong herbal aromas and light fruit flavors before finishing slightly high in alcohol.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"It's a difficult challenge to blend six different grapes into a wine without sacrificing focus, but winemaker Rob Newsom has done a splendid job with this new vintage of Marie's View. Roughly a third Cabernet and a third Syrah, which provide a potent core of deep red and black fruits, the wine is nuanced with layers of spice, leaf, toasted grain, loam and coffee grounds. Fine acids promise a long life.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Inky black in color, this Petite Sirah is rather thin in flavor. It has diluted blackberry jam fruit, compromised by vegetal notes.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Light aromas of spice, graphite and sour cherry are followed by elegant, tart fruit flavors. It's a pretty expression of the variety that should sing at the dinner table.",US-Washington-Sangiovese
"There is an earthy, barnyard character to this Sauvignon Blanc, with a tightly herbaceous flavor overshadowed by a more rustic style. It's ready to drink, but does need food to balance that earthiness.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"A ripe and creamy blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto, this is both fresh and richly textured. It has weight as well as a smooth texture, full in the mouth while also tangy. Already delicious, it will also age, so drink until 2018.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese White
"Aromas of exotic spice, prune, resin and nail polish remover lead the nose. The big, round palate delivers raisin, fig, licorice, ground pepper and a confectionary note alongside a network of polished, velvety tannins. Drink through 2026.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Always a bit herbaceous, this year the underlying leanness shows in rather green fruit, veering into bell pepper, dill, mint and oregano. All the oak in France and America can't really make the fruit any riper. But the oak does add smoky, creamy, vanilla notes and sweetness, too. There is some pretty fruit—notably blackberry—in the finish, but still, this is a wine of structure. It's fantastically well made, a classy quaff, and it will pair well with rich red meats, especially beef.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Golden in color, this wine starts out lightly reduced, followed by aromas of clarified butter and pear. The flavors are creamy and full in feel, lingering on the finish.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Rubbery, floral aromas of raspberry and cherry along with wet cement get this mature Toro wine going. The palate offers fleshy fruit and firm tannins, while the flavor profile brings floral, leafy, leathery flavors in front of a solid, fresh feeling and leafy tasting finish. Drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"There's an interesting elegance to this wine that appears in the form of bright berry, toasted nut and a light dusting of exotic spice. The wine is compact and streamlined and tastes much more refined than your standard Sicilian red.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"Next door to the top grand cru of Chambertin, this vineyard, with its east-facing exposure, is one of the stars of Gevrey-Chambertin. This vintage is hugely rich—ripe with voluminous fruit and smoky hints from the wood aging. It has density and the potential for long aging. Drink from 2025.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
The alcohol is overwhelming here in an otherwise fragrant wine with strong aromas of cola spice. This Petit Verdot is medium-bodied and very much happy to display its 18 months spent in new American oak.,US-California-Petit Verdot
"This is the winery's first single-vineyard Merlot. Polished and dense, its aromatics are a multidimensional mix of cassis, espresso, cacao and tobacco. Firm and full, the flavors continue along the same lines, going deep into a thoroughly satisfying finish.",US-Washington-Merlot
"An example of a soft, accessible Pinot whose rich, ripe flavors are the main attraction. Brims with cola, cherry, cranberry and red licorice flavors. Seems best over the next 2–3 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Tin House has been producing good Pinot Noirs that have been pushing the possibilities for Edna Valley, although the prices are going up every year. This bottling shows pure, ripe cherry, currant and cocoa flavors and rich, sweet oak, with the acidity that characterizes everything from this cool part of the Central Coast. Drink now through 2010.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Young, tart and compact, this is still in the primary fruit phase of its development. Clean, impactful and nicely structured, its flavors run from cranberry to raspberry to light cherry, all running deep enough to suggest tucking it away in the cellar for a few more years.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"The Hundsleiten vineyard is on the last slopes of the Weinviertel looking across the Danube Valley. With its great exposure, it produces a rich style of Grüner, with added structure and minerality. In 2007, the vintage exposed the terroir, giving a flinty edge to the still-rich character.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"Earthy aromas of sun-baked clay, overripe plum and a funky whiff of barnyard lead the nose. The rustic, lean palate offers blackberry jam, black pepper and a gamy note alongside gritty, drying tannins.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"Ruddy, ripe plum and cherry tones penetrate deeply through the core of this bold, voluptuous Pinot Noir. The palate balances opulent fruit with subtle tones of bramble and savory herb, as well as a piercing line of acidity. Fine grained but grippy tannins mark a puckery finish.",US-New York-Pinot Noir
"Dense and richly structured, this opens with black cherry, rose, leather and asphalt aromas. The concentrated palate offers succulent black cherry, crushed red raspberry, orange peel, sage, toasted oak, espresso and vanilla alongside brisk acidity. Astringent wood tannins leave the mouth feeling dried out. Drink after 2018.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"There's a grippy quality to this Cab, which has flavors of bright red cranberry, licorice and soy, along with ample structure and a soft finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This ripe wine is firm, with a core of dry tannins. Over this are delicious, juicy red-berry fruit flavors and acidity. The wine is still softening out, with fruit coming forward. It will be ready to drink from 2017. The property has been in the family for six generations; Robert Filliatreau is the current owner. Wine is vinified by Châteaux Solidaires co-operative.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Very dense wine, its tannins solid and concentrated. The structure is the leader here, with the young fruit showing through as black plum skins and crushed strawberries. This is a firmly tannic wine, needing aging.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Clover and apple aromas are basic but fresh. This is simple on the palate, with little to the mouthfeel. Vapid flavors of soda crackers, spent yeast and apple cider disappear on a quick finish.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Smoky beef aromas meet with crushed pencils, toasty oak, cola and sweet tobacco set against a subtle purple-fruit backdrop on this bottling by Rick Longoria. The palate is dry, easy to quaff and quite refreshing for a dark-red wine, with subtle touches of clove, black currant and more oak-smoked meat.",US-California-Tempranillo
Haermosa is made with organically-farmed fruit. It shows milky notes of peach yogurt and white chocolate. But it also shows zesty crispness on the close despite the thickness and fullness of the wine's overall texture.,Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Chardonnay
"Candied blackberry aromas meld with tar, rosemary and fennel in this balanced and expertly ripe wine from one of the pioneering families in Temecula. It's dense on the palate, with charred black fruit, dried herb and wild desert-shrub flavors, its alcohol content deftly tucked away.",US-California-Syrah
"Ripe yellow-peach and delicate red-berry hints lend a juicy, easygoing fruitiness to this concentrated Riesling. Soft, pink-grapefruit-like acidity and a flash of green herb add freshness to the finish.",US-New York-Riesling

"This crisp, tangy wine is packed with citrus flavors. Brightly textured with a mineral edge, it is fruity, hinting at spice along with a floral, fresh character.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This is a lovely, complex and ultimately beautiful wine, a blend of 67% Pinot Noir and 33% Chardonnay given extra time to develop in the bottle. It presents as daringly dry but doesn't miss a beat on flavor, showing moderate acidity built around a richness of hazelnut cream complemented by brighter high tones of grapefruit and lime.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Dominated by the grassy characters of Sauvignon Blanc, this is a tight wine, almost cool in its character. The fruit skin tannins are very apparent, giving the wine a crispness, layering acidity and a strong citrus element.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This wine is so light in color and flavor. It passes fleetingly across the palate, a wisp of fruit and acidity, before it is lost.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Fairly light in color and body, this wine sings in fresh cranberry and orange before revealing a meatier underbelly of black tea and sautéed mushroom. Finessed and vibrant in minerality, it has pretty rose and fresh-picked cherry characters that dance on the palate as it evolves and unravels provocatively in the glass.",US-California-Pinot Noir
This wine brings aromas and flavors of pear along with light tropical accents. The concentration dips toward the finish.,US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Here's a fresh and crisp Pinot Grigio that offers many more layers of intensity and personality than your standard, supermarket-bought Grigio. It shows creamy layers of silky, ripe fruit.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"Savory hints of bay and an inviting, lively pepperiness lend verve to this cherry-laden red. Somehow the fruit willingly shares the limelight with spicy, herbal notes and is all the more charming for it. This is ripe and rounded but not heavy and thus quite irresistible, with a moreish, lingering aftertaste.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Zweigelt
"With a touch of reduction from its 18-month maturation in new French oak, this wine is concentrated and youthful, still unwinding. Tangerine and peach flavors contrast with the more expected bite of apple, while moderate acidity brings freshness to the full-bodied nature of this rich, rewarding white.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Fogarty's basic Pinot Noir is very good, although it's not a wine for aging. With its soft dryness and rich tannins, it shows polished flavors of cherries, cola, herbs, cinnamon spice and subtle oak.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Alluring scents of wild berry, Alpine herb, pine forest and wild flower lead the nose on this vibrant linear red. On the elegant luminous palate, a mineral vein underscores red cherry, strawberry, star anise and cedar. Firm acidity and taut refined tannins provide the framework. Give it time to fully develop. Drink 2019–2025.",Italy-Lombardy-Nebbiolo
"Aromas are soapy, while the wine is bulky and oily in feel, with pithy, bitter tropical fruit flavors and a pithy, melony tasting finish.",Argentina-Other-Torrontés
"The tanginess of grapefruit peel, paired with very ripe Bosc pear, is already apparent on the nose before becoming full-blown on the palate. There is concentration and precision. The ripeness of this vintage is nicely corralled and held in check by citrus freshness and countered by yeasty richness and spice. The finish is gloriously enlivening, fresh and moreish.",Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
"From the Ferraud family's estate in Vaux en Beaujolais, this wine is ripe and full bodied. It has a touch of pepper as well as raspberry and red-currant flavors. Lively and full of fruitiness, it is ready to drink.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Deliciously bright and spicy, its cranberry and raspberry fruit is highlighted with pepper and cinnamon. With more breathing time it fleshes out, fills in with pretty pie cherry flavors and some pleasing toastiness.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Heavily toasted and loaded with black cherry and blackberry aromas, this blend of Cabernet, Malbec and Petit Verdot pushes cola, chewy plum and black-fruit flavors. The back end is all about coffee, mocha and bitter chocolate, and as a whole this wine shows Argentina in a fine light. As for the winery, Chakana almost always gets it right.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"All the Eight Bells wines show attention to cleanliness and varietal expression. This has a ripe apple flavor, with a lick of minerality on the finish.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Bold as always, with a ton of cedar, graphite, blackberry, vanilla and coconut notes on the nose. This is huge, tough and ripe, with massive blackberry, café mocha and vanilla flavors. It finishes hard but with a cascade of sweet fruit, marshmallow, coconut cake, herb and vanilla. Needs a few more years to settle. Drink after 2013.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro

"Cannubi is regarded as perhaps the finest vineyard cru in Barolo, delivering clean and elegant wines with power and determination on the finish. This expression stays true to the vineyard, with added touches of soft fruit and spice to the mix.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Should Bordeaux be 14%? Maybe, but not this wine. It is too big, dry, tannin-dominated and heavy. There is way too much extraction, and it shows in the bitter character.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Subtle aromas include white flower, pear and slate. The round palate delivers green apple and mature pear accented with mineral and hints of ginger. Fresh acidity gives a polished finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Bianco
"Confected but charming nonetheless, with pure aromas of honey and roasted pineapple bolstered by light minerality. Peach and fresh ginger come through on the slightly watery finish. Drink now.",Italy-Piedmont-Moscato
"A fruity wine from the lesser known Fixin appellation, this has strawberry fruit, soft tannins and a warm, rich texture. The acidity brings out a bright side to this approachable offering.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Allen Vineyard grapes have the maturity and complexity to impart a boldly balanced roundness of lemon curd, fig and apple, plus a searing undercurrent of salty minerality. With substantial weight, and texture for miles, it remains bright and fresh in the glass, with a lingering impression of cinnamon toast.",US-California-Chardonnay
"It's certainly rich and rounded as befits a Meursault, but there is also a fine definition of fresh yellow fruits, buoyed by wood, but suffused with tight acidity. Fine, balanced concentration, with enticing spring flower aromas.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"The aromas are initially more fruit forward than often seen from this area, with notes of plum followed by ash, black pepper, Stargazer lilies, charcuterie and iron. The flavors are palate coating and dense in feel, lingering on the finish. It needs some time in the cellar to truly show its stuff. Best after 2022.",US-Oregon-Syrah
"This gorgeously crafted, full-bodied Tempranillo is a modern beauty. Marzipan, wood grain, baking spice and black-fruit aromas make for a spectacular bouquet, while a ripped, strapping palate is raring to go. Flavors of blackened toast, fine wood, black plum and blackberry finish with gusto and notes of licorice, baking spices and cracked black peppercorn linger on the finish.

"Mike Sinor's lighter take on Syrah from his new coastal vineyard is refreshing though not quite as inviting as the Black Label.

"This opens with funky aromas of stewed prune, sawdust, sage and a hint of barnyard that carry through to the palate. Astringent tannins give it a gritty, drying finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Ripe red apple, lemon and caramelized sugar scent this enticingly fragrant Chardonnay. On the palate, fresh apple and citrus flavors are backed by a rich slightly clingy backdrop of vanilla cream. A fresh hit of lime and hints of wood and spice mark a moderately long finish. Drink now through 2019.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Lightly hued and luminous, this offers aromas of dried rose petal, red berry and a whiff of baking spice.

Drink through 2024.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"From the vineyard once known as Alisos comes this wine, with aromas of soft clove, red cherry and a touch of sage. A strong ginger spice reigns over the palate, which is bitingly acidic, and shows dark strawberry fruit and dark thyme herbs. This wine is still quite wound up, but that acidity will prove mouthwatering for years to come.",US-California-Grenache
"The flagship estate of the Vigouroux family, this medieval castle on a hill is also a hotel. The vineyard produces powerful wines like this, packed with dusty tannins and with dark berry fruits and fine concentration. It is a wine to age, drink from 2020.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"A fragrant cherry-blossom scent accentuates the fresh red-raspberry and strawberry notes on the nose and palate of this delicious, easy-drinking sparkling. Lush and ripe, the Cuvée Carnaval would be a lovely apéritif for late-summer entertaining.",US-New York-Sparkling Blend
"Green, herbaceous notes of lemongrass accent this steely, slightly nervy Chardonnay. While satisfyingly full in body and alcohol, it's a refreshing wine with cutting lemon-lime acidity highlighting fresh apple and pear flavors.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"A collaboration between winemaker James Foster and rockstar Pat Monahan of Train, this bottling shows black raspberry, pencil shavings and a feral animal-hide touch to the nose. The palate packs in a lot of licorice spice atop the heavy purple-fruit background.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Sharp acidity and sugary sweet, jammy raspberry and cherry flavors give this wine a distinctly rustic feel. It shows the silkiness you want in a Pinot Noir, but is disappointing for the price.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"An exotic, spicy Pinot Noir, this is medium-bodied and crisp, with complex cranberry, raspberry, red licorice and smoky sandalwood flavors. Drink this dry, silky effort now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A bit heavy and full-bodied for a Pinot Noir, with jammy, pie filling cherry and cola flavors. Turns chocolaty on the finish, like pudding. Delicious, but the structure is off.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine is firm and structured, with complex tannins and dark black-fruit flavors. Under the tannins, juicy fruit with considerable acidity gives signs of great potential. The aftertaste again comes back to the structure. Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"From a vineyard located at 1,700 feet with a western exposure, this single-vineyard expression offers candied red plum, clove, lilac, wet slate and dust on the nose. The palate is very tart, with cranberry and raspberry fruit lifted by fennel spice.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This blend of Pinot Noir, Chenin Blanc, French Colombard and Chardonnay has poise. It's dry to slightly sweet, with a brisk scour of acidity to lift the lime, orange and vanilla flavors.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Vinified in California with grapes purchased from Willamette Valley sources, this is a pleasant, quaffable wine, with simple red fruit and grippy acids. The flavors seem to get stuck in the back of the throat, a bottleneck of acid and red berry. Don't look for the breadth or sweetness of California Pinot Noir here, but you will find texture and nuance.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Generous, appetizing and juicy pear fruit dominates nose and palate. Flavors of ripe yellow Comice pear dance freshly, freely and fully expressed. The palate is compact, dry and juicy. The utterly inviting pear notes last and linger.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"Tastes young and aggressive now, with black currant and oak flavors and hard tannins. But there's something rich and interesting, a depth and complexity that suggest time in the cellar. Give it a good six years, and try again.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Soft and syrupy, with semisweet flavors of berries and anise.",US-California-Red Blend
"Sourced from 40-year-old vines, this elegant and forceful wine deftly marries varietal perfume and tangy fruit. Lush flavors of juicy nectarine and satsuma mandarin come with a gentle hint of mint. Complex and delicious, it puts a very positive, food friendly spin on Gewürztraminer.",US-Oregon-Gewürztraminer
"From two vineyard sources in Lodi, Uvaggio's Vermentino is always a delicious bet, with crisp, light melon fruit and a salty quality that calls out for food from the sea. Modest in alcohol, the texture is mouthwateringly addictive, a quality that follows through from first sip to last.",US-California-Vermentino

"Exuberant aromas of espresso, smoke and dark fruit leap up from the glass. The palate is considerably more reserved with fruit and earth flavors that linger.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Aromas suggest sandalwood, exotic spice, vanilla, subtle oak and mature black fruit. The warm palate reflects the forward nature of the vintage and delivers underbrush, black cherry, espresso and coffee alongside aggressive, drying tannins. You'll also notice the alcohol on this. Drink after 2019.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A bold, muscular, striking wine with nerves of steel, this offers a dense, demanding array of black fruit threaded with veins of espresso, smoke, tar, tobacco and iron. As it bursts with exotic barrel flavor, the fruit seems a bit buried, but time after time these wines unfold over the course of decades into glorious maturity. These are arguably the most long-lived and cellarworthy wines in Washington—if not in the entire country.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Here is a friendly, oak-aged blend with aromas of peach, vanilla, exotic fruit and butterscotch. The wine is luminous and bright and its soft, silky texture would work nicely with simple chicken or pan-fried fish in butter sauce.",Italy-Veneto-White Blend
"From vines planted in 1912, this has been an icon of South Australia Shiaz since 1952, when it was first bottled as a single-vineyard wine. Menthol and vanilla notes frame black cherries and cassis on the nose, while the palate reveals supple tannins and meaty, savory complexities. The finish is softly dusty, fine and long. Drink now–2030.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Too sweet and oaky for comfort, with caramelized flavors of pineapple and apple juice that finish with a white sugar aftertaste.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Lovely nose, with coconut and hazelnut scents augmenting the cherry/berry fruit. Not an ordinairy set of scents and flavors, but enticing and distinctive. The fruit is intense and perfumed, and the accents of coconut seem just right.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This base Barolo from the folks at Batasiolo (one of the area's biggest producers) offers a classic view of the Nebbiolo grape. The wine is seeped in traditional aromas of Spanish cedar, pencil shaving, red currant and black licorice. It's bright and lively in the mouth with crisp acidity and raw fruit flavors.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This opens with fragrances of perfumed berry and dried rose. The focused palate delivers crushed sour cherry, licorice, toast, clove and vanilla alongside fine-grained tannins. The slight warmth of alcohol on the finish is nicely supported by the ripe fruit flavors.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Nero
"Starts off with scents of apples and citrus, and maintains that fruit-forward focus all the way through. It's medium-bodied, with a slightly creamy midpalate and a touch of lemon custard on the finish.",Australia-Western Australia-Chardonnay
"Zesty lemon and lime aromas add elegance to unctuous white peach and apricot flavors on this delicate, yet remarkably complex wine. Off-dry in style, it balances a youthful fruit profile with nuanced shades of smoke and earth. Nervy citrus acidity drives a long, focused finish.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"A quick impression of vitamin pill gives way to highlights of lemon oil and caramel apples. The flavors continue in a fruit-forward vein, with a mix of ripe peaches and cantaloupe. This is a wine to enjoy while in the first blush of its youth.",US-Oregon-Pinot Blanc
"This opens with pretty aromas of blackberry, blue flower and a whiff of moist earth. The soft easygoing palate offers plum, black cherry and licorice alongside smooth, round tannins. Drink now.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"Here's a bright and very polished Riserva Barbaresco with clean and focused aromas of white cherry, cola, wild berries and dried currants. This expression from the Pora cru (known for its cellar-worthy wines) shows good acidity and drying tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A fine effort in a cool year, this reserve combines the best barrels from the winery's three estate vineyards, which occupy three different sub-AVAs. Hence the Willamette Valley appellation. With excellent depth and power, it showcases a core of cherry, berry and chocolate, accented with sweet spices and a hint of fresh herb.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This leads with clean yet soft scents of ripe apple, Anjoy pear and orange blossom. Those notes carry through to the medium-weight palate, well integrated with soft toasted-oak tones. It's harmonious and balanced, with ample acidity lending good lift through the close. Drink now.",South Africa-Western Cape-Chardonnay
"A rich wine with ample barrel influence on the nose along with white fruit aromas. Healthy and big in the mouth, with a flavor profile that blends tropical flavors with citrus. Deep and lightly toasted on the finish, with an excellent feel and texture out the door. Noticeably less oaky than in the past.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"Expressive in oak, earth and clove with cinnamon-cola, this savory, complex wine is also impressive in its ability to offer crisp and focused lines of citrus and fresh-picked raspberry. It teeter-totters the variety's ability to be both fruit-forward and elusively hard to reach. Streaks of thyme and rosemary figure into the mix. Drink now through 2023.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This bold blend of 50% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc leads with aromas of ripe plums, graphite and a hint of coffee and balsamic herbs. The soft, concentrated palate delivers ripe black berries, chocolate and mocha. A licorice finish arrives alongside velvety tannins and the warmth of evident alcohol. It's delicious but fast approaching its ideal drinking window.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This is high in alcohol, but the result is a rich Pinot Blanc, with citrus, tropical fruit, mineral, white flower and honey flavors. The bright, citrusy acidity keeps the mouthfeel keen and zingy.",US-California-Pinot Blanc
"The last vintage from vines planted in 1936, this offers aromas suggesting toast, oak, vanilla, forest floor, graphite and a whiff of eucalyptus. The firm, concentrated palate offers dried black cherry, cranberry, game, and a note of exotic spice alongside a backbone of fine-grained tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Dark and meaty, soft and full, with a very light touch of leather, this nicely catches hold of the varietal character, yet here it's coupled with vivid, fresh and ripe cherry fruit. It's a fine expression of the evolving style of Tempranillo in central Oregon, styled for both immediate enjoyment and cellaring over the next six to eight years.",US-Oregon-Tempranillo
"You can't go wrong with this Amarone from one of the area's most storied houses. It always shows consistent quality and the 2010 is no exception. It boasts ripe black cherry and white pepper notes, with hints of raisin and almond. Velvety smooth and round, it's also fresh and very drinkable. Enjoy after 2016 for additional complexity.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Tightly wound in black fruit and integrated tannin, this is a medium-bodied wine with interwoven oak that retains a healthy amount of acidity. Black fruit dominates along with a thickness of violets and meat. Made in tiny amounts from a small producer, it showcases a good vineyard site for the variety.",US-California-Syrah
"Roasted aromas of tomato and red plum are spicy. This has a chunky, blocky mouthfeel that's searching for its groove. Herbal plum and tomato flavors finish a bit raw in feel and salty in flavor.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"There's a hard edge to the mocha, herb and cherry aromas. The palate has blocky, dry tannins that distract.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Bright, clean, crisply rendered raspberry fruit—nicely spiced—really shines here. This relatively modestly priced cuvée carries itself with style and elegance, still young, tight and tart, with plenty of medium-term aging potential.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A bright, tight and crisp wine that is is mineral, tangy and refreshing to drink. It hints at the ripe fruits that will develope through 2017.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Alvarinho
"This is a neutral smelling bubbly with a distant hint of nectarine. It's foamy on the palate, with mild citrus flavors along with a touch of green. The finish feels o.k. but doesn't offer much additional flavor.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"This Portuguese variety, most often spelled “Verdejo,” isn't widely planted in California. But here, from Bray's estate vineyard, it has produced a lovely wine. Crisp and fine, with flavors of honeysuckle, lemongrass, peaches and candied ginger, it's the perfect accompaniment to Vietnamese or Burmese food.",US-California-Verdelho
"Bargain hunters should like this mildly medicinal Cab because it's got raspberry and black fruit character and only minor faults, i.e. slight medicinality. Otherwise it's fruity, steady and respectable, with good body and mouthfeel.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Earthier aspects mix with the fleshy yellow-plum notes on nose and palate. The medium-sweetness puts the ripeness of the fruit center stage, countered by hints of pith and freshness. Drink soon.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Relatively light tones of vanilla, cranberry, tart plum skin and dried fennel combine for a nicely tight nose on this clonal study. The palate is also quite tart and focused on cranberry and pomegranate, with underlying vanilla richness.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"There's a lot going on in this Merlot, which is likeable now for its rich blackberry, cherry, cranberry, cola and spice flavors. It's dry and balanced.",US-California-Merlot
"A nice, fruity Sauvignon Blanc, a little sweet and simple, but satisfying nonetheless for its array of ripe pineapple, citrus, lime, green apple and spice flavors, brightened with crisp acidity.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"A very appealing nose of earthy spice starts this successful Chard, and leads into a full, rounded blanket of toasted oak and fruit. There's complexity here without heaviness, and the wine finishes big but pretty. Pair with richer seafood—like crab—or creamy poultry dishes.",US-New York-Chardonnay
Ripe stone fruit dominates the appetizing nose. The palate also shines with generous yellow plum ripeness that is nonetheless tempered by zesty lime peel flavours and a deeply savory yeast note. This packs quite a little punch.,Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"Right off the bat this wine is pure and smooth. The nose is pretty, with cranberry and cassis. Next up is a palate of pure red fruit and only a light shading of oak. The finish draws applause for its clarity and buttery nuances. It's what a good Chilean Cabernet should be; it's ripe and easy to drink, yet fairly solid and impressive. Best Buy.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of stewed berry fruits and damp leaves lack freshness but are not spoiled. This Garnacha-based blend feels thick and resiny, almost to the point of syrupy. Creamy oaky stewed berry flavors finish with an herbal hint and sticky tannins.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"From estate fruit, this Chardonnay falls a bit flat in the mouth. The fruit is light and simple, and there is a hint of bitterness that leave a chemical aftertaste.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"There's an inky, raw feel to this riserva (Sangiovese blended with tiny percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot), followed by candied cherry and rum cake. It finishes sour and bitter.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A heavy, oaky Chardonnay whose tropical fruit and vanilla flavors are dull.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Bold, but complete and well-balanced, this full-bodied wine from a Sierra Foothills stalwart is packed with opulent black plum and cassis flavors and a firmly tannic texture. It starts with lightly smoky, peppery aromas and finishes with lingering fruit, spice and mocha notes. Best after 2020.",US-California-Malbec
"Incredibly rich, with ripe cherry, plum, spice and herb notes at the fore. It's all framed in luscious, broad tannins that are firm but velvety. Long on the finish.",US-California-Syrah
"This blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Alicante has aromas of espresso, blue flower, red and black berries. The palate offers toasted oak, coffee, bell pepper, and black cherry accented with black pepper. It closes with astringent wood tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This luminous blend of Insolia and Viognier offers a very pretty and feminine juxtaposition of fragrant floral aromas (from the Viognier) against tones of citrus, peach and kiwi from the Insolia. There's a touch of sweetness on the close.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"Jasmine and summer blossom hover over ripe, aromatic aspects suggesting melon or quince that shine with power on the dry, streamlined and taut palate. The freshness is immense in this precise, bracing and charming wine.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Bright, ripe strawberry and cherry flavors are contrasted with the firm tannins of wood aging. This is a very young wine, with layers of acidity, spice and toast. Drink from 2016.",France-Alsace-Pinot Noir
"Barrel notes take the lead with aromas of char, butterscotch and spice overrunning the fruit. There's a pleasing creamy feel to the sweet fruit flavors but the variety is near impossible to find.",US-Washington-Viognier
"Put this one in the cellar for a good six years, at the very least. Right now, it's tight and tannic, with dramatically layered blackberry, currant, dark chocolate, mint and cedar flavors.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A taste of candied grapefruit jumps out first from this wine, which is altogether clean and crisp. It's also generous in bigger flavors of fig and vanilla. More creamy and fruity than herbal or savory, it's right for seafood or spicy stuff.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Some Cabernets can get away with high alcohol, but this one one can't. It doesn't have the richness of fruit or the structure. What you get is a light blackberry-jam flavor and even a vegetable note. This is unlikely to get better with age.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Showing considerable wood flavor, this wine has some tough tannins to overcome before it really shows its best. The fruit is ripe, full and packed with blackberry flavors. Once fully integrated, the wine should reveal more of a luscious side. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Named after the daughter of owner Cristiano van Zeller, this wine serendipitously has Tinta Francisca in the blend. It's a major statement of the quality of old vines on tough soil that marks the Douro. Big tannins and a dark, brooding character show the youth of the wine, while the powerful structure promises long aging. Drink from 2019.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Strong aromas of blackberry extract, cedar, nose-tickling herbs and a bit of bacon fat mark the nose of this release from a winery whose 84-year-old namesake died in October 2014. The flavors balance tartness with ripe berries, roasted fennel, emergent tannins and purple flowers that linger into the finish.",US-California-Syrah
"This is a full and creamy wine, with an abundance of fruit flavors. Notes of white pear and apricot are portrayed in this ripe and warm feeling wine. The acidity and mandarine zest notes provide crispness and structure. Drink from 2014.",France-Provence-Provence white blend
"The aromas are vibrant, with notes of flowers, jasmine, lime and peach. The palate drinks a hair off dry, with the concentration coming off as light but still providing interest.",US-Washington-Riesling
"This wine costs a lot for what it's giving. The nose starts out hard and fruitless, and while the aromas come around, the wine always holds onto its corn and haystack character. Zippy acidity gives the mouth zest, and it also livens up papaya, banana and apricot flavors. Complex and different, but does it taste good enough to justify a $78 price tag?",Spain-Catalonia-White Blend
"There is a firm structure here underpinning the sweet, ripe strawberry flavors. The wine offers freshness from its berry acidity along with a final tight core of tannins. Age for 2–3 years.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"A minty strangeness permeates this wine, which comes off as artificial in flavor. Rumblings of cherry grenadine try to emerge from the muddled midpalate, which otherwise lacks flavor. The quick finish is medicinal and sweet.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"An impressive Syrah, showing a good structure of acids and tannins and considerable complexity. Offers layers of blackberries, charred meat, moo shu plum sauce and exotic, peppery spices, wrapped into firm but finely-ground tannins. Drink over the next six years.",US-California-Syrah
"This is box wine taken seriously, even featuring a picture of winemaker Denise Wordenon. Fresh-squeezed blueberry fruit mixes with black rocks, milk chocolate and cedar on the nose, followed by an easy-to-quaff juiciness on the lightly bodied palate. It's not very complex, but perfect for summer barbecues or car camping.",US-California-Merlot
"From a site farmed by the great Ulises Valdez, this barrel-aged white is remarkably subtle on the oak, allowing bright, rich flavors of lemon, lime and mango to shine through, along with more complex aspects of green apple and anise.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Wonderfully floral, brooding oak notes frame this inviting Sankt Laurent's red cherry fruit. On the palate, the oak comes across as vanilla, enwrapping the cherry fruit with richness. This is light on its feet but ripe and elegant with wonderful, lasting freshness.",Austria-Burgenland-St. Laurent
"From a vineyard holding in the midst of prime Pinot Noir country, Maffei intrigues in ripe, hearty plum, black cherry and kir aromas and flavors. The tannins are soft and nicely managed, accented by notes of nutmeg and black pepper.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A mature, beautifully balanced wine, with great fresh raspberry and red currant flavors. It is rich, dense, balancing toast, yeast and fresh fruit. With its dry edge, think of this as a food wine.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Restrained bramble berries and crushed violet notes emerge hesitantly from the glass in this even-split blend of Petit Verdot and Tannat. An inky, heady palate of dark blue and black berries shows is balanced by a line of black currant acidity, while grippy tannins provide structure and length.",US-Virginia-Red Blend
"High-toned gooseberry, pear, papaya and fig flavors mark this dry, but creamy Sauvignon Blanc. It's rich with fruit, yet dry on the finish with brisk acidity.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine is big, very full bodied and very lush in texture. Super-ripe in flavor, it rides at the place where plum notes segue to prune, and black cherry to cherry syrup, which is a very tasty place to be. Plenty of fine tannins frame all that concentration, yet the mouthfeel stays soft.",US-California-Barbera
"Tobacco, baked plum, toasted oak, vanilla and mature blackberry aromas waft out of the glass. The dense, one-dimensional palate offers raspberry jam, prune, mocha and a confectionary note alongside velvety tannins.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"Based in Saint-Hippolyte, the northernmost village of Haut-Rhin, this domaine has produced a smooth, ripe Pinot Blanc, immediately accessible and showing a full, spicy character. Attractive and ready to drink.",France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"Bready and yeasty smelling upfront, this feels round but also dry on the palate. Briny, pickled, yeasty flavors lead way to a salty finish. Quickly dissipating bubbles render it more of a demi-sec.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Very perfumed and dense, this is a structured, aromatic wine, full of dark berry tones and fine acidity to balance. The dry texture and the solid tannins promise some medium-term aging, so drink after 2015.",Portugal-Alentejano-Syrah
"The Savigny-lès-Beaune-based producer shows his Pinot Noir skills with this wine. It's generous, with red plum flavor, light wood-aging notes, ripe tannins and crisp acidity. It's rounded and ready to drink.",France-France Other-Pinot Noir
Generously ripe notions of yellow plum and juicy pear fill the nose. The palate benefits from the same fruitfulness but adds a touch of pepper and herbal savor at its concentrated core. There is something joyful about this. Despite the generous fruit this stays streamlined and supercrisp. The finish focuses on that wonderfully spicy pepperiness.,Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"Winemaker Adam Lee notes that only two Oregon Pinots were made in 2011, as all fruit was declassified. Indeed, this is a thin, peppery wine, with highlights of orange peel and grapefruit, and just a short slice of red berry fruit.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Slicks of honeycomb and lanolin lend richness to tart white peach and lemon tones in this dry, elegantly structured wine. It's silky in mouthfeel, but not weighty, streaked with white grapefruit and a firm, mineral finish.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Still quite young and showing an herbal side to the sharply-defined red fruits, this Cabernet will need a bit more bottle age to soften the rough edges. Nonetheless, the complex weave of bark, herb, earth and wild berry is balanced and effective; just give it more time.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is mild and smooth compared to its peers, with good berry and cherry flavors, a broad, moderately tannic texture and a nice sense of layering.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Full bodied and with good, gripping tannins to make the texture appetizing, this wine is very dry and nicely complex. Moderate cranberry and dark chocolate flavors are accented by hints of sage and black olive—classic Cabernet traits.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Raisin and fig aromas are good but not overly complex or special. This P. X. feels rich, chewy and a touch sticky, with sweet-as-sin fig, chocolate and cinnamon spice flavors that suggest coffee cake with a drizzle of melted fudge.",Spain-Andalucia-Pedro Ximénez
"With a blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is ripe, with a tannic structure. There is fine, juicy acidity coming through the dry shell of this young wine. With another year, it will fill out and be ready to drink. Drink from 2017.",France-Provence-Provence red blend
"Cedar and bramble lend toasty, woodsy complexities to this Cabernet Franc's luscious blackberry and cherry palate. It's fleshy and succulent in mouthfeel, framed by fine tannins and sweet-tart sour-cherry acidity. Elegant yet approachably juicy, it's drinking nicely already but should hold well through 2020.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"Old-style Carmenère with green bean, mocha and muddy berry aromas. Tight and more acidic than expected, with generic red berry, chocolate and mocha flavors along with a palpable wave of green. Finishes quick and crisp.",Chile-Central Valley-Carmenère
"Rosella's is a very good vineyard, but this Pinot is unripe and unbalanced. There's an herbal, vegetal note that gets in the way of the cherries and pomegranates. Hard to see it going anywhere, so drink up.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A big wine, but some persistent sulphur and earthiness on the nose results in aromas of leather, scrambled eggs and tobacco. Rugged on the palate, but that's to be expected for a big-boned Malbec like this. Flavors of blackberry and black cherry are supported by powerful oak, leather and an infusion of herbs. Drinkable now and best through 2010.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Earthy, moderately complex and mature aromas of lemon peel, dried red-berry fruits and sandalwood set up a tannic palate with vitality given that this is now nine-years-old. Earthy cherry and plum flavors are uncomplicated and finish tannic, with mildly leafy berry undertones. Drink through 2018.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Elegant and well structured, this offers vibrant strawberry fruit wrapped around inviting aromatics of violet and spice. This cool-climate Pinot boasts a silky texture on the palate and finishes with subtle suggestions of wood smoke and cinnamon.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This sprightly-sweet Riesling fills the glass with an opulent floral perfume of rose petals and orange blossoms. It's profoundly aromatic, yet remarkably elegant, balanced by layers of crisp honeydew and peach flavors. A zesty strike of acidity freshens the finish.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"The von Kesselstatt estate released four GG bottlings in 2009, and this wine was perhaps the least of them. It's very good nonetheless, with fresh, slightly floral aromas and bold flavors of baked apple and orange zest. There's a chunkiness in the mouth and a slight coarseness of texture compared to the others, but that's splitting hairs.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"This wine is 70% Syrah and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, with fruit coming from Yellow Jacket, Stoney Vine and Pepper Bridge vineyards. Aromas of herb, ember, black cherry, earth, smoked meat and plum are followed by palate-coating, rich fruit and savory flavors, with enough tannic structure to benefit from some time in the cellar.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Full and ripe, this wine offers thick meaty flavors of pineapple and peach, finishing in sweet vanilla oak.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A crazy-good combo of lavender, espresso and baking spice flavors make this full-bodied wine fascinating to taste. It's deeply colored, aromatic and tannic, but not heavy. The wine has a vivid stamp of spicy oak, with enough lavish blackberry and black cherry behind it for balance.",US-California-Syrah
"This appellation blend is very light in color and also quite restrained aromatically, with the slightest hints of lime, lemongrass and vanilla on the nose. The sip is quite tense, powered by lime acidity and a chalky mouthfeel. A richer white-peach element arises toward the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A dry, mineral wine, hiding its potential richness. Flavors of ripe pears and yellow fruits are matched by lime acidity. The wine has considerable power and a dense character, showing the immense density that comes from this vineyard. Age for 4–6 years and more.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A hearty bottle of Chardonnay with the simplest label you could imagine, it emphasizes earthy, oaky, buttery flavors over fruit components. This is medium-bodied, dry, rich in texture and moderately tannic.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A funky undertone, similar to the Nicholas Estate bottling, weaves through the wine, along with a mix of cranberry, raspberry and sour cherry fruit. Despite the 14% alcohol, this wine seems light, delicate, the flavors pleasing but pale, and the finish a gentle fade.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of pressed spring flower, peach blossom and yellow stone fruit take center stage. The dense full-bodied palate offers ripe yellow plum, dried apricot and rosemary honey.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"Hogue is back as a value player. This is a fine effort, ripe enough to avoid the greenies, and showing some detail and cut to the tannins. There's nothing wimpy here; it's got some chewy red fruits backed with earthy tannins, acids proportionate, and a finish that's just under 14% alcohol.",US-Washington-Merlot
"A strongly wood-aged wine, it is packed with toast and vanilla, but has a hard time remembering the fruit. At the moment, the wine has weight, the lightest hints of ripe tropical flavors and acidity. It needs more aging to broaden out and allow the fruit to sing. Drink from 2016.",Portugal-Dão-Portuguese White
"Fonréaud's vineyard is on the highest point of the Médoc (all of 120 feet). This vintage shows a smooth, ripe wine full of juicy black fruits. It's not dense, and the fruitiness will let it age relatively quickly. Drink this attractive wine from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The nose is a blend of peach and earth. The palate comes with great intensity, holding against the sweetness with an exquisitely delicious streak of quinine bitterness which lends direction and precision, along with tangy lemon freshness. This creates ample tension and moreishness as well as a lip-smacking medium-sweet finish.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Pretty aromas of red berry, crushed flower and a hint of rosemary lead the nose on this bright red. The fresh palate offers crushed raspberry, green tomato and cinnamon. It's fresh, sleek and balanced.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Nero
"Cantina del Pino makes some of the finest Barbaresco available today. This shows a succulent quality, with aromas of smoked bacon, wild berries and forest underbrush. Savory and sophisticated, this has loads of personality.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This is a well-made blend of 53% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc, 6% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot. It is among the producer's “curious blends,” created from estate properties in different styles. Here, firm, structured and present tannins dominate an otherwise concentrated and spicy mix of black licorice, clove and tobacco.",US-California-Red Blend
"Rich and fine, this is extraordinarily decadent. Flavors of pineapple, mango, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and spicy oak are wrapped in a note of vanilla cream, and brightened with crisp acidity. A bit heavy and seemingly sweet, this is showing its best now.",US-California-Chardonnay
"91-93 The wine is tight, densely textured, very firm in character. It has considerable weight to go with the sweet fruit, very powerful.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Ripe, earthy berry and cassis aromas smell damp at first but unfold nicely. Bright acidity and abrupt tannins make for a packed palate. Lightly oaky flavors of plum and berry show a note of vanilla. It finishes crisp and choppy due to the aforementioned bold acidity. Drink through 2022.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This is made in a delicate, acidic and bone dry style. Some will say it lacks richness—and it does, by Napa standards. But it's quite an elegant wine, silky and light, with a hint of blackberry and tobacco flavor.",US-California-Merlot
"Powerful in pungent gooseberry flavors, this wine will appeal to aficionados of New Zealand Sauvignons, but will leave those craving riper, lusher fruit flavors out in the cold. The acidity is very high, almost making the wine what the French call pétillant, or fizzy.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Another knockout of this vintage from this site, a portion within the larger estate Quail Hill Vineyard, Summit is perfumed and pretty, full bodied without ever seeming heavy. Crisp punches of strawberry, cherry and a streak of lemon tartness please the palate in an endless loop of complex, velvety texture.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This 100% Petite Sirah showcases the variety's tannins, full body and fruity concentration, with waves of blackberry and blueberry jam, cherry pie, cbocolate and new oak flavors. It's too soft to develop in the bottle, but will be lovely over the next year with rich stews and roasts.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"With yeasty aromas of Animal Crackers, vanilla and pear, this is more warm, soft and sweet than in the past. The year's warm characteristics are draped all over the palate, which is soft and wide. Flavors of creamy white fruits and vanilla finish with lychee and grapefruit. This lacks some spine and vivacity but will be good through the end of the year.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Seems like we're catching this wine late in its cycle. It's not very expressive on the nose, and even though there's still life to the palate, it's dealing only mild apple and citrus flavors followed by heat and acidic scour on the finish.",Argentina-Other-Torrontés
"Maestro opens with fruit and balsamic aromas of red currant, grilled pepper and Mediterranean herbs. The palate is still quite tight and closed, but reveals soft flavors of plum, black cherry, espresso and nutmeg. This needs a little more time to open up, so give it a few more years in the cellar.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Polished and fragrant, this charming red offers alluring scents of freshly picked rose, red berry, tilled soil and a whiff of aromatic herb. Vibrant acidity and supple tannins balance the bright cherry, strawberry, white pepper and anise flavors. Enjoy through 2017.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Despite its moderate alcohol level, this comes across as medium to full in body, with a velvet and custard texture that coats the palate with flavors of grilled pineapple, citrus and melon. It's made in a concentrated, opulent style, yet it finishes clean, with lingering notes of citrus. Drink now through 2020.",Australia-Victoria-Chardonnay
"This luminous, ruby-red blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Ciliegiolo and 5% Alicante starts with intense aromas of forest floor, underbrush, berry and tobacco. Lively, juicy fruit flavors are accented with mint, black pepper and thyme accompanied by bracing tannins. Give this a couple of more years to come around. Vos Selections, Tosco Wine.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This widely produced Chardonnay is soft and oaky, with honey-infused vanilla, mango and Meyer lemon flavors. It's your basic Chardonnay, creamy and easy to drink.",US-California-Chardonnay
"There's intensely sharp fruit character on the nose of this bottling from a single clone and block in this historic vineyard, with candied raspberry and pomegranate aromas that are leveled by Early Grey tea and pressed purple flowers. The palate is extremely lively and tightly structured, with dark boysenberry and candied raspberry flavors that rise into a minty finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Red fruit, cassis and sweet rubbery notes define the ripe bouquet. Feels medium to full in size, with leafy flavors mixed with plum, vanilla and oak. Red fruits including strawberry and raspberry work the mildly oaky finish.",Spain-Central Spain-Tempranillo
"Rich and savory, this has bold fruit notes of cherry and blackberry followed by delicate nuances of licorice, tar, spice and leather. Thanks to its structure and density, it's a wine you can really sink your teeth into.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Fondo Filara is a blend of Nero d'Avola and Frappato, two important indigenous grapes. This expression offers tangy spice, bright fruit and a fresh, lean mouthfeel.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"This is a new line of label-driven wine meant to be adventurous and whimsical. Catchy label aside, the wine inside entirely delivers in well-integrated fruit and floral characteristics, showing the crispness of its stainless-steel fermentation. Tangy, it's both tart and tropical, finishing focused and lean.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Salted caramel and baked apple contribute to the rich, full-bodied luxuriousness of this wine. Matchstick, lemon tart and pineapple add to the experience, finishing tart and with substance.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This edition of Soave Classico Runcaris offers simple aromas of pear, Golden Delicious apple, stone fruit and melon. There's a drying point of minerality at the back and crisp acidity to boot.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"This Cab has a prominent streak of eucalyptus-like menthol on the nose as well as cranberry. This continues on the palate, which is fairly juicy and soft. With dry tannins the finish is on the dusty side, a pairing quandary solved most likely by juicy red meat.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Unlike many vintages of Coudoulet, this one is medium-bodied and fruit-forward, offering hints of cherries, mulberries and wild Provençal herbs. Those garrigue notes linger on the softly dusty finish. Drink now–2023.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"A bright copper color, this is done in a French style, with an emphasis less on freshness than on more mature flavors. Impressions of rose water, cracker and orange liqueur contribute to the mix. This wine should be consumed now through 2016.",US-Oregon-Syrah
"There's hardly any oak on this wine, so what you get is pure, clean Sauvignon character. With crisp acidity, the wine brims with lemon, lime, green melon, vanilla and spice flavors, with a hint of tart gooseberry. It's totally dry.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aged for 15 years on its lees, this mature Champagne is toasty, shedding its bright fruitiness while gaining a richer, more developed and nuanced character. Almonds and spice are partnered with intense acidity, resulting in a beautiful wine that is ready to enjoy now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend

"This young Roero shows Nebbiolo's charming side. It has a lovely fragrance of rose, violet and crushed berry, while the palate delivers bright cherry and cinnamon spice. It's fresh, polished and enjoyable.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"The Looney Vineyard bottling is the outlier in the Archery Summit lineup—a different AVA and a non-estate vineyard. The Ribbon Ridge AVA is a subset of a subset within the Willamette Valley, and it may be the hidden gem for producing great Pinot Noir. This wine is sensual, spirited, spicy and smooth. The cherry and raspberry fruit is highlighted with bright acidity and whiffs of baking spices. The new oak is gently applied and the use of wild yeasts may have added some textural nuances also.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot opens with savory aromas of cured meat and dusty black pepper with some black olive, licorice and dried cassis. The wine shows a brawny personality with tight, slightly gritty tannins on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"Light and crystalline in the glass, this snappy bottling shows ripe cranberry fruit, thyme and composting violets on the dynamic nose. Though very lightweight on the palate, it delivers waves of raspberry, hibiscus and spicy cinnamon flavors, revealing how layered and vivid that a fresh and bright expression of Grenache can be.",US-California-Grenache
"“Open and drink” the instructions should read, as this smooth and luscious wine is best enjoyed young. Half was barrel-fermented, yielding flavors of caramel, almond paste and buttered nuts. Pair with leek, bacon and potato soup, says the winery, which sounds just about perfect.",Canada-British Columbia-Chardonnay
"The vintage was kind to Frazier, whose red wines excelled in 2008. This Cabernet Sauvignon, made by Kirk Venge, is classic Napa Valley. It's dry, richly textured in tannins, and complex, offering intense waves of blackberries, black currants, crème de cassis and oak. Yes, the alcohol is high, but who's counting? As good as it is now, it should develop bottle complexity over the next 4–6 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Crushed oregano, red currant and a little bit of asphalt show on the shy nose of this wine that is sourced mainly from southern Monterey County. There is lots of brick, thyme and rosemary on the palate, with a bit of dried berry fruit.",US-California-Red Blend
"Big and spicy wood flavors dominate this rich, expressive wine. With its black currant and berry flavors, it's both fruity and structured. There is dense dryness as well that gives concentration to back up the fruitiness.",Portugal-Dão-Touriga Nacional
"Heavy char and cedar aromas sit atop green-leaning black-fruit scents. This is tight, juicy, acidic and woody on the palate, with shallow black-fruit flavors that are largely covered by charred oak. A zesty, toasted and tangy finish is full of life but falls short on complexity and depth.",Spain-Northern Spain-Graciano
"Named for a Loire Valley clone, this New World wine aspires to an Old World sensibility and achieves it in its floral invitation and bright, peppery overtones. Coiled within its thickness of tannin and dense cherry are ethereal, earthy whispers of intrigue and acidity. This is a lively, lovely wine.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"This 100% varietal wine leads with woodspice, green herb and flower aromas and follows with sweet, vanilla-laced black fruit flavors. Although aged entirely in used French oak, the barrel influence is prominent. The tannins bring dryness, needing food to ease their grit.",US-Washington-Petit Verdot
"This delightful rosé bursts open with ripe watermelon and strawberry scents and flavors. Highlights suggest candied rose petals, and the flavors continue into cherry soda and hints of pink peppercorn. It's a big bold fruity simply fabulous bottle.",US-Oregon-Rosé
"Tastes as sweet as jam, namely the raspberry, cherry and blackberry kind, with melted chocolate and anise stirred in for good measure. Fortunately, adequate acidity provides much-needed balance. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"An enormously  complex wine, but one that's not quite ready for prime time. Mainly Chardonnay, with 21% Pinot Noir, this was aged on its lees for seven years, giving it a soft creaminess and also an intense, doughy yeastiness. The raspberry, lime, toast and vanilla flavors are rich and slightly honeyed. With brisk acidity and slight scouriness, it wants a good eight years in the cellar, and should age well beyond that.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Some might say this is old-school Oregon Pinot, with an emphasis on herbal acidic flavors and thin tart fruits. Despite aggressive aeration, the wine refuses to open up, and the impression of barely ripe fruit and chalky acids lingers.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This oak-heavy blend of Chardonnay and indigenous Sicilian grapes opens with luscious tones of toasted almond, apricot and candied lemon. There's a spicy vanilla note on the close, and the wine will appeal to those who appreciate an oaky Italian white.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"Soft and slightly sweet, this Pinot Grigio drinks like the syrup in a can of apricot and peach fruit.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"The light apple and mild citrus aromas are nice. It feels fresh and medium in intensity, with notes of peach, apple, pear and citrus in equal, moderate doses. Short, lemony and fresh on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"This ripe Pinot is as sweetly sappy as raspberry syrup. The oak brings additional sweetness, this time of caramel and buttered toast. A little clumsy now, but might gain traction in the cellar.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Made in the California style, with very ripe pineapple and apple fruit, elaborated by French oak barrels, malolactic fermentation and sur lie aging. The result will appeal to many, even if it's a bit obvious and direct.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Ripe and smoky, this is a warm fruity wine. It has tannins as well as juicy acidity, black fruits and a firm structure in the background. This will be a rich wine when it is ready to drink in 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A raw-edged wine, with dusty tannins and blackberry fruits and sawdust wood flavors that don't quite gel, and some green asparagus flavors to finish.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Strongly flavored, with jammy raspberry and cherry pie flavors accented with sweet vanilla, cinnamon spice and smoky cedar wood. A good, tasty Pinot Noir meant for drinking soon.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Cinder is quietly one of the wineries carrying the banner for this nascent growing region. The aromas here are sappy and brooding, with notes of Marionberry, huckleberry, bittersweet chocolate and a spice top note. The blue-fruit flavors show an alluring sense of purity and grace that carries through the finish, which includes a savory note that heightens the interest. Delicious stuff.",US-Idaho-Syrah
"Saintsbury's Garnet bottling established the tradition in California of a lighter-style, but no less elegant, Pinot Noir that retails at a decent price. The '08 doesn't disappoint. It's silky and crisp, with ripe flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola and sandalwood. Now–2011.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A light-colored wine, this reflects the cool character of the Hautes Côtes. The result is a wine that's stalky, fruity and layered with acidity. It has a lightly strawberry, juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2015.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"The nose isn't very expressive but eventually reveals fig and raisin aromas. The simple palate offers raw, red cherry alongside brisk acidity and firm tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Lean and steely, with penetrating minerality, this bone-dry Riesling just begs to be paired with briny oysters or caviar. The palate boasts delicate apple and pear flavors that are layered with smoke, fresh fennel and a deliciously herbaceous finish.",US-New York-Riesling
"From a blending of two barrels—one new and one neutral—this is a snappy, sappy, tangy wine with ripe, forward red and purple fruits. These notes are framed with pretty barrel toast, and the tannins are firm, ripe and balanced. Drink now with pleasure or tuck it away until 2020.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Strong flavors of clove and mint dominate this unusual Riesling. It's quite dry, with good penetration, though a world apart from most of its peers. With the right food (Thai?), the potent flavors might prove complementary.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"This blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 20% Counoise shows sharp aromas of pressed olallieberry, cola, uncracked peppercorns and dried oregano on the nose. A strong central line of smashed plum, fig and sweet berries arises on the sip, but with tons of herbal lift.

"Owner/winemaker Tony Rynders speaks of walking a tightrope to deliver the best each vintage has to offer. Here the results are supple and downright sexy, a boatload of plummy fruit swathed in chocolate and almond paste. It's lush, seamless, and perfect for near-term enjoyment.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Fans of toast, butterscotch and butter will gulp this down happily, but these reviewers are sad to see the wine's fruit get lost beneath it all. Finishes like caramel candy; smells like buttered whole wheat toast. Will certainly have its appeal, but we'd like to see the fruit center stage next vintage.",Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"This Cabernet Sauvignon smells ripe, with cherry cola, red currant and red plum aromas. Pleasant tones of church incense and vanilla lead to an oaky palate. Cherry and geranium come through, but the oak is prevalent and leads to a long, smoky finish.",US-Virginia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This tasty and full-bodied blend of Rhône varieties has an attractive, spicy, oak aroma that continues through the flavors. It finds ripe black-cherry notes in the core and enough concentration to form a lingering finish.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend

"There's a savory roasted-meat quality to the nose of this blend of 68% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre and 12% Syrah that also offers crushed riverstone, a touch of violet and coffee-syrup scents. The hefty, meaty character carries right into the palate that is thick in body, chalky with structure and redolent in roasted blackberry and tangy elderberry fruit.",US-California-G-S-M
"This blend of 75% Grenache, 15% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre offers intriguing cherry candy, rhubarb and hibiscus scents, with touches of exotic cinnamon and woodsmoke. Caramel and baked cherry flavors mark the cherry pie-like palate, dusted with star anise and clove over a solidly tannic frame.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is the producer's highest and most westerly vineyard site. It holds back from the start, still tightly wound and somewhat reduced on the nose. As it opens, ethereal layers of wild strawberry, green tea and lacings of herb and white pepper unveil to tremendous effect.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"There's a wildness to this wine, with spicy, Provençal herbs and briary tannins that frame the blackberry, currant, licorice, balsam and cedar flavors. It's tightly wound and dense now, not showing much elegance. But it's interesting and different and could well be an ager. Try after 2011.",US-California-Syrah
"A classic Dão blend, which includes Alfrocheiro and Jaen grapes, this is produced by top winemaker Alvaro Castro. A year in oak has given it richness and a smooth, almost velvety character. Underneath this surface, the tannins are all there, balancing the ripe fruit flavors. It will develop well; drink from 2017.",Portugal-Dão-Portuguese Red

Additional elements of strawberries just pulled from the ground add to the feral, natural aspect of the wine.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This blend of 52% Syrah, 25% Grenache and 23% Mourvèdre is quite sultry on the nose, with crushed boysenberry, dried violets, wet clay and the slightest touch of soy.

"While unoaked, this tropical swirl of mango, guava and pineapple is unabashedly rich in style. Decadent caramel and butterscotch notes are a bit on the confected side but clean up tidily against a streak of sunny lemon on the mid palate. Drink through 2019.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Light aromas of herb, plum, vanilla, cocoa and dark fruit lead to a palate that is simultaneously sweet and tart, with a plush midpalate. It provides intrigue.",US-Washington-Malbec

"Light in color and stemmy and spicy in equal parts, this light, bright wine is complex and intriguing in its offering of white pepper, baker's yeast and cranberry coated in vanilla. It delivers flavor and nuance in a pleasing showcase of the variety.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Showing more of the spicy side of Blaufränkisch, which dominates the blend, this is a wine that also brings out ripe tannins, juicy red fruit, acidity and a dense core of dryness. It is still young, the fruit still bursting to get out.",Austria-Burgenland-Austrian Red Blend
"Klipsun Vineyard provides the fruit for this wine, with 10% Boushey Syrah rounding it out. This wine offers aromas of herb and wet copper penny that lead to full-bodied, boisterous fruit flavors. It the aromas come together it could move up a notch or two.",US-Washington-Malbec
"An intense, creamy wine, showing fresh fruits as well as almonds, spice, yeast and toast flavors. It has been finely crafted to bring out a bouquet of spring flowers and a richer, warm feel. It should certainly be aged, at least for 4–5 years.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"From four vineyard sites across the appellation, this coastal wine shows an intriguing note of rose petal and turned earth before unleashing full-bodied waves of chewy, cool-climate tannin. Its rhubarb and red cherry fruit has a savory edge; acidity carries it long into the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Herbal and stemmy (100% whole-bunch fermented), this is a bit of an outlier in the world of Australian Pinot Noir. It's light to medium in weight, with gentle tannins and tart cherry fruit. Oak takes the form of mocha on the finish. My initial impression was “simple but appealing,” but upon reflection perhaps it just needs more time to show its stuff.",Australia-Victoria-Pinot Noir
"Dry and crisp in acidity, with citrus flavors, but fundamentally unripe. It has a strong streak of green chlorophyll, mint and ammonia that could charitably be described as gooseberry.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Good blackberry, black currant, cocoa and cedar flavors in this Cab, and it's nicely dry, with firm, finely ground tannins. Turns rather sharp on the finish, and that tartness may never go away.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe and full-bodied, this is a bright and velvety wine, driven aromatically by lush cherry, cola and vanilla. Textured and fleshy, it's a strong statement for the vintage and vineyard. Deliciously drinkable now, it should also do well in the cellar, through 2020.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Unusual aromas of blue fruits are matched against cardamom and cumin scents. The palate is blocky yet dominated by acidity, while flavors of plum, black currant and woodspice are exotic. A hard finish shows hickory and barrel flavors along with wiry acidity.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"A damp herbal character shows first on the nose of this wine, with wet sage and marjoram spicing up the stewed cranberry fruit. The action explodes once sipped, with black cherry and mulberry giving backbone to the cardamom and other Indian-spice components. It combines richness and energy.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of oak take the forefront, with ripe plum, roasted coffee bean, smoke and meat juices in the background. The palate offers dark berry layered with oak sensations alongside astringent wood tannins. It has an excruciatingly dry finish. Superior Wines, Siema.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese

"This is a creamy and lush expression, with soft sweetness in the form of peach nectar and almond. The effervescence is soft and foamy.",Italy-Veneto-Glera

"This is a sound, everyday Merlot with some special qualities that give it an extra point or two. It's dry and smooth in tannins, with layers of cherries, blackberries, currants and licorice. Not likely to age well, so give it a little time to breathe and drink now.",US-California-Merlot
"Earthy and mossy smelling, which is true to the variety. In addition, there's mild balsamic and dark-berry aromas. The palate is full and easy, with black-fruit flavors that carry herb and peppery qualities. Sweet and sizable for a $9 wine, with toast, coffee and controlled bitterness on the finish.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"Intense and concentrated, full of fruit, tannic structure and richness. It comes from a fine vintage and shows the ripe fruit, rich berry and red plum character, along with a more austere, ageworthy edge. A very fine wine, and one worth keeping for 5–6 years.",Portugal-Dão-Portuguese Red
"Dense, layered and juicy, this has a good concentration of bright blackberry flavor. The small amounts of Primitivo and Barbera are subtly apparent. With a snap of chocolate on the finish, it's well rounded.",US-California-Zinfandel

"Intriguing aromas of dried herbs give nuance to the heartier bourbon barrel, cherry candy and caramel aromas on the nose of this bottling of traditional Portuguese varieties Touriga Nacional, Tinta Cão, Tinta Francesca and Tinta Madeira.

"This is a blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Petit Verdot, 8% Cabernet Franc, 7% Malbec and 7% Merlot. A masterpiece of blending, it has myriad pinpoint details, from the nose of flowers and berries, to the mouthfilling mélange of red and black fruits and finishing highlights of pepper and Asian spice. A precise, complex, elegant and powerful   Pentad with tremendous length, it represents the pinnacle of vintner Casey McClellan's 25 years of winemaking.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Balletto's style is typically earlier picked, drier and more acidic and lower in alcohol than many other Russian River Pinots. The 2007 is quite a good wine along those lines. The great structure houses flavors of currants, Dr. Pepper cola and spice, while the firm tannins give a chewy leathery feel. Should develop through 2013.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A modern, popular Chardonnay made with very ripe tropical and pear fruit flavors and a strong oaky influence. Not very subtle, but will satisfy fans of the style.",US-California-Chardonnay
"One of the largest vineyards in the Médoc and just outside Pauillac, this estate is also one of the most reliable.

"A bit sharp and rubbery at first, with herbal, floral, berry aromas rising up in due time. The palate is a little rigid, with angular acidity and semitart raspberry and red currant flavors. Lightly toasted on the finish even if there's not much oak on this regular, competent CS.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This esteemed winery's annual bubbly is crafted much like its still Chardonnays, showing focused aromas of chalk, lemon zest and a telltale brie cheese rind dairy element. It's very yeasty and slightly sour on the mouthwateringly sharp palate, with squeezed limes, lemon pith and underripe kumquat flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Planted in 1988, this vineyard 's fruit captures the unique minerality found in this AVA. It leaves an impression of sucking on rock—not a bad thing in a wine. The black-cherry fruit grips the palate with real power and some density, with potent herbal highlights as well. Drink this now through the mid-2020s.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This is a light- to medium-bodied Shiraz with a bright profile of juicy red berries and just a hint of chocolate, turning rather crisp on the finish. Drink now.",Australia-Australia Other-Shiraz

"Give this polished young Pinot Noir some time in the cellar to come around. It's a seriously good wine, dry, tannic and medium-bodied, with a dense core of cherry and plum flavors. If you have to drink it before 2015, give it several hours in a decanter.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The nose gives little away—it needs some air—but the palate is dense with blueberry and black cherry. The tannins are very fine but firm and find a lovely counterpoint in the fresh acidity. Soft notions of tar and smoke envelope the plummy fruit, making this all the more alluring. Lovely now, but with future potential through 2020.",Austria-Burgenland-Red Blend
"Even if you like some earthy, mushroomy notes in your Syrah, this one is unripe to the point of vegetal. It's also too soft for balance. Despite some decent blackberry and cola flavors, it's a real disappointment.",US-California-Syrah
"This is a straightforward but enjoyable selection, with black cherry aromas and whiffs of bitter almond that carry over to palate alongside a hint of black pepper. Enjoy this with savory pastas.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend

"This is another top-flight example of how good the 2012 vintage was for South Australian Shiraz. The oak here is so subtle as to not factor into the wine's scents of raspberry and cracked pepper. Hints of spice and vanilla mark the palate, gently accenting red berry fruit before ending in a flood of silky tannins. Drink now–2030.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"From a vineyard in Yountville, this wine has a voluptuous entry of baked peach and vanilla, with a back beat of tart key lime. Layered and lengthy, it offers flavor and body in abundance, ending fleshy and full.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"With their '05 reserve, Reverie has produced possibly their greatest Cabernet Sauvignon ever. But be forewarned, it needs cellaring. Not a long time, just enough to soften and sweeten a bit. Right now, the tannins shove to the front of the line, pushing aside the delicious blackberries and currants. But the wine has Bordeaux-like elegance. Even a few years in the bottle will help resolve things.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Grown against all odds (and against all likelihood of economic viability) overlooking the Pacific Ocean atop Catalina Island, this Chardonnay is a success every vintage. It shows a broad spectrum of nutty aromas, from macadamia to cashew, with touches of honey and daffodil. On the palate, expect walnut, vanilla and oak smoke, with a butterscotch-like finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Bursting with bold, fully ripe fruit notes of pear and peach, followed up with tropical notes, this is a lush fruit bomb of a Chardonnay to drink over the near term (3–4 months).",Australia-Australia Other-Chardonnay
"Incredibly rich and sweet with honey, apricot and orange flavors, this intense dessert wine is balanced with citrusy acidity. It's super-delicious, long and gooey sweet on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Gris

"This Merlot-dominated blend is full of dense fruit, with a soft black currant flavor. A bite of tannin at the back gives structure and aging potential. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Fine and fresh, brightened by grapefruit, lemon zest and bright acidity, this is a delicious wine, ready for seafood, finishing so clean and crisp.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
This opens with aromas that recall wood shop and stewed prune. Oak and oak-driven spice dominate the palate and keep the tart cranberry note in the background. It lacks the fruit richness necessary to stand up to the invasive oak while astringent tannins leave a rough and mouth-drying finish.,Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This straightforward wine delivers a lot of flavor for the price. The juicy, rounded layering of dark cherry, dried herb and cedar works within a light-bodied, mellowed context of balanced acidity and fruit.",US-California-Merlot
"92-94 Barrel sample. This has fruit, with delicious black berry frutis, It cjharms with elegance and ripeness, at the same time as giving a core of tannin. Definitely on the fruity side.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A profoundly deep nose of red and black fruit, with cedar, ginger and nutmeg. The sense of balance and grace is sublime, as layers of cassis, plum and cinnamon keep unfolding.

This bottling honors its pedigree as California's first classic Cabernet.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"The flavors in this Merlot are exceptionally ripe with cherries, red currants, red plums, mocha and new oak, and the tannins are rich and refined. High alcohol gives it a heat that makes it uncomfortable.",US-California-Merlot
"Boisterous fruit shows on the nose of this wine from the heart of the newish appellation, presented in a specially made Ballard Canyon bottle. Olallieberry jam gains nuance from pulverized purple flowers. The palate begins with straightforward purple fruits then evolves into potpourri, incense and dried berries.",US-California-Syrah
"Honey tangerines and freesias perfume this dazzling auslese that's full of pristine yellow peach and citrus flavors. It's luscious, almost opulent with fruit, but cut with a shock of lemon-lime acidity that extends the long, long finish.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Some Pinots are light and simple. This one's light and wonderfully complex. It's so translucent, the minerals of the earth seem to be speaking through the fruit. Silky and delicate in the mouth, it conveys rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, cinnamon and smoky sandalwood. Drink over the next few years.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Zinfandel fans will celebrate this powerfully ripe, exuberant wine. It's classic Russian River Zin, dry, tannic, heady and enormously rich in black currants, raisins, prunes, beef jerky and exotic baking spices. The finish is so fruity, it's almost sweet, yet is actually quite dry, making it clean and zesty.",US-California-Zinfandel

"The aromas bring notes of plum, dark chocolate, clove and barrel spice. The flavors are forward and lush, showing irresistible appeal.",US-Washington-Malbec

"Taylor Fladgate's vintage Ports are always among the legendary wines. This hugely structured wine keeps the dense, perfumed tradition very much alive. Along with the power, it also has wonderful fruit, bursting out with blackberry jam. Even with all the fruitiness, it needs to age for decades.",Portugal-Port-Port
"This would pair perfectly with the sweet and savory qualities of a dish like Roman saltimbocca—veal scallops wrapped with prosciutto and sage. Black cherry, cassis, dark spice and tobacco flavors all play a part in the wine's appeal.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Impressively powerful, structured wine that has spice, richness, plenty of firm tannins as well as a punch of sweet plum and red cherry flavors. There is an edge of acidity that suggests aging potential.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Given this Chandon-owned winery's success with Malbec, you might hope for more here. But this fading Chardonnay doesn't have much going for it. It's flat, with pleasant clove-like aromas and cider-like flavors. It also finishes flat, indicating a short lifespan ahead of it.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"A textured and minerally wine, this is wine has plenty of citrus flavor. It is fruity and crisp, and it offers a touch of vanilla and lively acidity on the finish.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"This value brand makes a number of West Coast Pinots, with mixed results. Here are very strong, dominating flavors of vanilla and breakfast tea, of the sort often associated with oak additions during the winemaking process. Don't look for any specific Willamette Valley character here. It's a light generic red, tasting mostly of vanilla.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This beautiful sparkler rested on its lees for 70 months, giving it extra smoothness and rich denseness. The bouquet is redolent of apricot, ripe fruit, melon and lightly toasted baguette. The mouthfeel is long, elegant and driven by fine perlage.",Italy-Lombardy-Sparkling Blend
"Made from organically grown grapes, this crisp white flirts dangerously with herb and grass tones—what is often called gooseberry—before settling down. It's quite drinkable, if a bit heavy on the finish.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

"Leather, game, blue flowers and ripe, dark-skinned fruit aromas open this full-bodied wine made from the estate's highest vineyards.

"This wood-aged Vinho Verde is a world away from the light and sweetened wines. It is rich, almost Chardonnay-like in its smooth, creamy character. At the same time, it still shows its origin in its tight acidity and a crisp aftertaste. Drink now, or better in a year.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White

"Ripe berry, black plum, toasted oak and espresso aromas lead the nose on this young wine. The palate offers black cherry, prune, roasted coffee bean and sage alongside fresh acidity. Tightly compacted and still raspy tannins need time to soften. Drink after 2017.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"This Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend offers aromas of sweet berry, blackberry, pipe tobacco and molasses. It has great, thick concentration and bright fruit flavors.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Raspberry crumble immediately comes to mind in this vineyard-designate, a luxuriously built, big-bodied expression of a warm, easy vintage. A nose of violet keeps it from getting overly rambunctious around the heartier aspects of cranberry, crushed rose petals and cherry cola.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Masses of lemondrop candy, pineapple tart and mashed ripe pears in this marvelous wine, but that's not all. Buttered toast, crème brûlée, bananas sautéed in butter and brown sugar are some of the additional complexities. That makes the wine sound sweet, but it finishes dry. High in alcohol, but balanced, this flamboyant Chardonnay is best enjoyed now.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Pure sweetness, the wine has a rich texture with just a hint of botrytis but plenty of opulent spice, very rounded and unctuous. It is just beginning to show maturity, but could easily age further, the sweetness so well integrated into the orange zest finish.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"This phenomenal bottling from the winemaking team of Mike Sinor and Nathan Carlson hits the nose with a judicious touch of vanilla-laced buttercream as well as scorched lemon slices and orange peels. It's playfully lithe on the palate, with just a touch of oak warmth, racy acidity, chalky grip and a faint hint of dill. It's great for now, but will age with nutty style thanks to the balancing tensions.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Seductively smooth and intriguingly aromatic, this blend of several knock-out vineyards along Westside Road—Allen, Bacigalupi, Bucher, Rochioli Riverblock and Williams Selyem Estate—is instantly delicious, sharing a concentration of cherry, strawberry and citrus that perfectly captures the essence of the fruit, accented by a tease of black tea.

Enjoy through 2023.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a classic. Not an enormous wine, but with all the finesse and elegance of great Burgundy. The fruit is vibrant, juicily red, bursting through the gentle tannins. The freshness is mouthwatering and vivid. It is probably not a long aging wine, but in 5 years its freshness and ripeness will be equally enjoyable.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir

"Opulent, lush and round in style, this leads with ripe aromas of apricot, yellow apple and mange, laced with hints of clementine oil, marzipan and toasted baking spice. The palate is full and creamy, but balanced by ample acidity, lifting the texture from an overly flabby impression. Flavors of woody spice and peach pit dance on the lingering finish. Drink now–2017.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Chardonnay
"A solid value in German Riesling that just misses out being a Best Buy, this wine features aromas of honey-drizzled baked apples with cinnamon and lemon juice, a refreshingly light feel on the palate and an ultraclean, persistent finish with undertones of ripe melon. Drink now–2015.",Germany-Rheinhessen-Riesling

The nose is not forthcoming and the palate only hints very subtly at white pepper and green pear. There is ample freshness on the light palate and the finish is one of pure lemon zest. It is weightlesseness and poise rather than power that convinces here.,Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner

"An outstanding wine, the best California Cabernet Jean-Charles Boisset has ever produced from any of his properties. It stands out in any tasting of its peers. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and aged in 60% new oak, it shows satisfying, complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cassis, hazelnut-infused chocolate and spices. Hard to exaggerate its power and grace. Wonderful now and for a good six years, but it's difficult to predict its evolution beyond 2018.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"From old Cabernet vines, this rich and full-bodied wine was made from a magnificent vintage. It has rich, ripe and powerful fruits that burst with energy and structure. It was bottled without added sulfur.",France-Southwest France-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A bit of a letdown after a string of riper, more successful vintages. Feels sharp and somewhat herbal, with a hay or dried wheat edge to the black cherry and rhubarb fruit. Could just be going through a tough period, and might emerge on the other side in 5–6 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A totally unique blend of Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Riesling Italico, Breg is a labor of love with a deep golden color and intense aromas of caramel, butterscotch, mature apricot and chewy caramel. The wine's density is thick, creamy and smooth. Try it with red wine foods such as succulent lamb or honey-roasted ham.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend

"The aromas of this full-bodied, dry and sophisticated wine show black olive, light smoke and oak. The palate brings flavors of dark cherries and a touch of dark chocolate, with firm tannins offering a pleasing texture.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Blended with 8% Petite Sirah and then aged almost a year in American oak, 30% of it new, this is fruity and smoky in equal measure. Its tones of blackberry, leather and black pepper are harmonious.

"Ruggeri & C. is one of the best producers of Prosecco Superiore sparkling wine.

"Petite Sirah is Concannon's specialty, and their Livermore vineyard makes a California classic.

Should age effortlessly for a very long time, in a proper cellar.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Reserved on the nose, this bottling by Billy Wathen and Dick Dore from their friend Rick Longoria's vineyard offers cranberry, fennel, lavender and a touch of smoke on the nose. It's delicate in its approach, with tightly woven strawberry, red plum and cranberry fruit lifted by dried sagebrush and more of that wildfire smoke.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Sweet aromas that verge on syrupy set up a sweet and easy palate of black cherry and cassis. This has a nice texture as it shows good body, feel and fruit quality. Maipe means “lord of the winds” in a native language, and while this Malbec won't transport you anywhere, it's good for the price.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This is so young, the yeast of the ferment still swings on the nose. Underneath that, tightly curled freshness suggests both candied lemon slices and lemon sorbet—but this needs time to unfurl its glory.

"Don't let the price tag fool you; this is a sophisticated blend with Merlot, Cab Franc, Malbec and Syrah comprising a quarter of the total. Aromatic and inviting, it brings spicy berry, red currant and Bing cherry fruit into play. Chewy tannins carry a hint of herb, and the presence of new oak is minimal at best.

The wine is elegant and ethereal with a polished nature to its firm tannins capped by pleasantly piquant freshness on the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"It's labeled simply Columbia Valley but in fact it's made from all Red Mountain fruit.

Aged in once-used French oak, it has picked up some char and graphite notes.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Heavy oak is a front-row theme throughout this tannic, extracted, black-tinted Garnacha. Hot fudge sundae and sawmill aromas lead to a palate that's as tannic as sandpaper.

"One of the producer's top wines, this wine is named both for Francis Ford Coppola's uncle and for the famous mathematician of ancient Greece.

"Aromas of a raspberry torte with flaky crust mix with cardamom and marjoram spices on another compelling wine from the region's historic producer. Tart cranberries kick off the palate, followed by wet slate and graphite minerality in the midpalate that barely hide riper fruits. It culminates in a cola-laced finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Fruit is harvested from the celebrated Rabajá cru, a short distance away from the town center of Barbaresco, and presented in a tight, more traditional expression. There's a nervous or sharp quality to the wine that is backed by immediate aromas of chopped herbs, soya sauce and spice.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"2011 is another excellent vintage for this unique and aromatic blend from Brian Carter. The mix is 51% Viognier, 35% Roussanne and 14% Riesling, and it offers a riot of scents and flavors; a rotating Ferris wheel with lemon skin, beeswax, orange peel, tangerine, succulent lime and ripe pear. It's flat out luxurious, long and lissome.",US-Washington-White Blend

This is the winery's best Viognier in years.",US-California-Viognier
"From the northern end of the Haut-Médoc region, close to Saint-Estèphe, this dark-hued wine is still very structured. Smoky wood-aging flavors give complexity that balances the ripe black currant fruitiness. It's still developing, so don't drink before 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a beautiful brut, easily worth its price. It shows the fancy elegance of more expensive bubblies, with its refined texture and rich but subtle flavors of strawberries, peaches and brioche. Made from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, and easy to find, with 25,000 cases produced.",US-California-Sparkling Blend

"Made from young vines, this is the second wine of Suduiraut. It has young, honeyed character, with a ripe, opulent texture that lays bitter orange fruits over drier noble rot flavors. It is so delicious now, but will be better from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Organic vineyards in the shadow of the Corton hill and the Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru provide the basis for this wine.

"Delicate and dry, this offers lightly spicy strawberry fruit and supporting acids. It's pretty and pale, light but not dilute, and would be an ideal match to a pork dish with a fruit sauce.",US-Oregon-Rosé

Just beautiful, and should develop through 2012.",US-California-Merlot
"From a granitic section of the appellation, this wine features bacony notes layered over black cherries and cedar. Hints of black olive, brown sugar and baking spices add nuance.

"Larger than life in terms of oak and tannin on the entry, this wine is elusive in fruit. Medium-bodied, it feels weighty and sharp-shouldered, while being clearly well-made and expressive of its appellation and variety. A cherry-vanilla note rings on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Very rich aromas of cherry, blueberry syrup and hot blackberry jam-filled pastry greet the nose. So the sour cherry and tart cranberry flavors are surprising on this medium-bodied wine, which also picks up interesting peppery notes into a lingering finish.",US-California-Merlot
"You can taste the sunshine embedded in this darkly concentrated Barolo. Ripe fruit aromas of blackberry and cherry liqueur open the bouquet and segue to notes of leather, spice and black licorice. The mouthfeel is plump, rich and well structured.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A disjointed, out-of-the-box Malbec that starts out peanutty and earthy on the nose. Things round out aromatically, but in the mouth it's angular and edgy, with stunted blackberry flavors offset by tartness. Has its positives but overall it doesn't fully click.",Argentina-Other-Malbec
"Despite the name, this is the value offering, not the reserve, from Soléna. Young, tart and tight, it displays primary fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, with sharp, lemony acids. Holding until 2016–2017 may help to smooth it out, but it's perfectly delightful already.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This mature wine shows its toasty side. A mineral texture is now integrated with the almond, yeast and bread flavors to give a wine that's crisp while no longer bringing out its fruit. This wine is elegant with poise and great style. Drink now.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay

"Generous, juicy and ripe yellow pears are boosted by some residual sweetness that is well balanced by the midpalate texture. Drink soon for maximum fruit.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris

"This wine has great power along with magnificently rich fruit. Wood aging provides a judicious support to its fullness and opulence.

"This is nearly perfect, a massive, monumental wine whose sheer power is matched only by its grace and refinement. The flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, buttered toast and cedar flood the mouth, tightly controlled by firm tannins and good acidity. Decant for several hours if you open it now, but better to give it 6–10 years in the bottle.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Here is a lighter, paler shade of Prosecco with opulent and cheerful soapy and herbal qualities (thanks to 10% Pinot Bianco) backed by lemon candy and polished mineral. Yellow apple and chalk are immediately recognizable. The mouthfeel is creamy and foamy with fresh crispness that is noticeable but not exaggerated.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco

"Given four years in 100% new French oak and another year in bottle, this is a blockbuster of a wine.

"There is a pleasing creaminess to the mouthfeel, yet the wine retains well-defined green apple and citrus fruit flavors. Where many Viogniers are bitter and hot at the finish line, this one is like sucking on a creamsicle.",US-Washington-Viognier
"A wine that is very mineral, very structured in its tannins, the black fruits flavors a straight line cut through with acidity.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"A foundation of truffled earth and forest floor give this a rustic edge, complemented by savory herb and black tea. Weighty, it shows its backbone of oak aging well, finishing abruptly in cranberry and dark cherry.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine is rounded, rich and full of ripe fruit. Its wood flavors, giving spice and vanilla, are a backdrop to the generous apricot and pear flavors and good acidity. Drink this wine from 2022.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Toasty and solid on the nose, with hints of mineral, dark spice, black olive and cassis. It's structured but a little rich and sticky, with sweet berry and cassis flavors along with brown sugar on the finish. A blend of six grapes that's easygoing and generous. Drink now through 2013.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Red Blend
"This Malbec-led blend opens with grapy black-fruit aromas. The palate is saturated through and through, while intensely ripe flavors of blackberry, cassis and black plum finish long but not aggressive. This comes across as being well polished and smooth; drink through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Apparently this is the current release. The winery aims at a Right Bank, Bordeaux-style profile. At this advanced age the wine is showing some bricking at the edges, with mature drying fruit and a big dose of barrel. Smoky, oaky and toasty, it's a wine to drink up, perhaps with a big steak dinner.",US-Oregon-Merlot
"This is thin and uninspiring, but it's dry, with watery berry and spice flavors.",US-California-Shiraz
"The palest of rosés, this crisp, bright and fruity wine is full of tight acidity, freshly picked raspberries and steely acidity. It could age a few more years to bring out a toastier character. The specially designed bottle has a hummingbird etched on the inside and gold on the outside.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"A delicate, almost fragile wine, this opens with tart fruit flavors of strawberry and red plum. There's more than enough acidity, smooth tannins, and a graceful flow to the wine, ending with a light dusting of cocoa.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This Dundee Hills vineyard really shines in 2012, with multi-layered flavors of sweet, spicy, slightly candied fruits. Kirsch, orange peel, smoke and sandalwood play against each other, with a citrus kick to the underlying acidity. Bright and focused through a long finish, this is one to tuck away for a few years. Drink 2017–2025.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
91–93. Barrel sample. A ripe and fruity wine with some chocolate extract as well as black-currant fruitiness. This is a soft wine with attractive final acidity.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Delicious and classy, this is based on Merlot, with the other four classic Bordeaux varieties in proper proportion. It flatters immediately with its wealth of blackberries, black cherries, cola and mocha that finish so dry and spicy, yet it has that extra complexity that makes it intellectually interesting. Drink now and over the next six years.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A faint hint of pink shines on this sparkler named after the winery owners' dog. Aromas of fresh melon and slight peach lead to a faint cherry note upon sipping and creamy mouthfeel, followed by plum skin tartness and a yeasty, sour bitterness.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"This honeyed spicy Spätlese seems straightforward in fruit, but its racy, nerve-tingling energy is electrifying. Fresh apple and pears are revitalized by streaks of lemon, lime and grapefruit that linger through a moderately long finish.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Dusty aromas blend with cool-climate notes of bell pepper and lime on this racy, green-leaning SB. Flavors of wet stones, lime and salt are crisp, while this finishes with a bell-pepper flavor and zesty acidity. This was made for raw oysters or ceviche.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Yes this is a big boy but its chocolate and espresso mixed with dark caramel are so well defined, so bold that anyone looking for a serious example of mountain Primitivo need look no farther. The wine's cherry flavors are vibrantly balanced between an intensity of layered darkness and complexity.",US-California-Primitivo
"This rosso has a pretty bouquet of fruit and floral aromas, with an underpinning of spice. The palate is soft, with ripe plum, cinnamon and chocolate flavors, and while well made, it doesn't have a lot of personality. This is ripe and ready, so enjoy soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Fresh raspberries, red cherries and even blackberries arise on the juicy nose of this wine from Adam Lee, but it's lifted by wild mint, hummingbird sage and damp coyote scrub. The palate is very herbally spiced, with thyme, marjoram, black cardamom and charred pine, laid across dried strawberries, cranberries and sour cherries, all tied together by serious grip. Drink 2019–2025.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Rich doesn't begin to describe this Pinot Gris. It's explosive in orange and apricot jam flavors, with vanilla and buttered toast layers. There's a fat, oily texture that adds interest to a variety that can be simple.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"Earthy, stalky, rubbery berry and plum aromas are solid but rustic. This has a tight, juicy, tomato-like feel and raw flavors of red plum and currant. A hold-steady finish with tomato and mild herbal notes closes this out.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"The hot 2009 vintage has yielded young vintage Ports with intense color. Here the color shows the ripeness of the perfumed, concentrated black fruit. Rich, full, more open than tannic, likely to age over the medium term.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Tiers of blackberry jam, plum, milk chocolate, anise and smoky cedar flavors mark this layered Cabernet. It shows the thrilling balance of the vineyard, with ripe fruit in tension with minerals, brisk acidity and wonderful mountain tannins. A splash of Merlot and Cabernet Franc add soft, cherried relief to Cabernet's hardness. Drink this wine now and over the next 15 years, as it gradually sheds its fruit.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
The wine has some extraction that leaves a bitter edge. That needs to blow off to allow the underlying ripe blackberry fruit to come through. So wait until 2018.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This opens with aromas of toast, vanilla and stewed plum. The rich, monolithic palate offers fleshy black cherry, vanilla, anisette, plum cake and a confectionary note alongside round tannins. Drink 2016–2022.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Rich aromas of concentrated raspberry, dried strawberry, beet juice, clove, turned loam, rose petals and forest floor show strongly on the nose of this bottling. The palate offers a lush body, with mocha, mace, and Indian spice, along with a touch of tart cranberry and dark soil.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Fresh green herbs on the nose accumulate fruit and floral notes on the palate of this pretty but robust rosé. A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay and Gewürztraminer, it offers intense red berry and watermelon fruitiness along with a pleasantly clingy, silken mouthfeel.",US-New York-Rosé
"Intensely perfumed, this offers enticing scents of wild red berry, rose, violet and exotic spice. The polished, linear palate delivers ripe black cherry, spiced blackberry, cinnamon and star anise alongside silky tannins and refreshing acidity.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"There's a lightly spritzy tickle in the mouth, and a metallic undertaste to this Chardonnay. The blend includes 5% each Pinot Gris and Sauvignon Blanc, all done in stainless steel. Thin and a bit green, it does not quite come together.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"The small Beaujolais cru of Chénas is next door to Moulin à Vent. As this wine shows, it has the same firm structure and ripe fruit. The wine from the cru's chateau is dense, smoky and has plenty of firm tannins. It is a wine to age, so drink from 2019.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This densely structured, finely crafted wine is the latest vintage from one of the Douro's iconic brands. It has great weight and, at the same time, elegant fruits and structure that offer good aging potential. It could be drunk now, but best to wait until 2016.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Made from old vines, this is a powerful wine that is reminiscent of a dry Port. This gives the wine density and richness, along with firm tannins and flavors from the wood aging. The black fruits are still developing, showing youthful freshness. This intense wine has plenty of development ahead of it; drink from 2018.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Bramble, wild cherry and touches of dill and bay leaf show on the nose of this bottling. The palate, which is thick with tannins though not too rich, shows damp and dewy flavors of marjoram and oregano, with cedar and black rock giving backbone to the tart cherry fruit.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Perfumed and a touch exotic for Rioja, with coconut and floral berry aromas. Definitely full and ripe in the mouth, with sweet flavors that go back and forth between baked and sugary and rich and rewarding. A sweet, mature wine at its core, with molasses and brown sugar.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Grenache's essential fruity character is well-preserved thanks to the use of a whole berry press. Popcorn pink in color, it offers sweetly peachy flavors adorned by wild strawberry and tangerine. The wine light and minerally.",US-California-Grenache
"This wine has a nose of black fruits, mocha and toffee, and on the palate, warming spices, tart cherry and a touch of sweetness. The flavors aren't overly complex, but the wine is appealing, and the finish lingering.",US-New York-Cabernet Sauvignon
"These relatively young vines deliver a juicy wine with bright berry fruit. Tart and tangy, it carries a light savory note as well. This has the acidity to improve and age through 2026.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Cabernet Sauvignon (80%) makes up the majority of this wine, with the rest equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Aromas of high-toned green herbs, spice, black cherry and blackberry lead to lively cranberry and cherry flavors. It shows a sense of freshness, though at times it seems a bit green.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a 100% Cabernet, and its tannins are so strong that it's virtually undrinkable now. It displays class in every way, with an intense concentration of cassis liqueur and blackberry that's especially deep in the middle palate, but it also persists into a long, spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2018, and it has the structure to go the long haul.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"There are tarry and deep purple, almost black fruit flavors to this blend of 70% Petite Sirah-16% Tempranillo-14% Tannat. Once sipped, olallieberry emerges as the dominant fruit flavor, with espresso and tar complementing the thick tannins.",US-California-Red Blend
"For a Nouveau, this has surprisingly structured fruit, with some firm tannins. It has a juicy cherry flavor and ripe acidity, with a tangy, textured finish.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"From a somewhat maligned vintage, this is a commendable effort. It's not as textural as the wine can be in better years, but it shows enough richness to easily carry the attractive leather, mocha and spice flavors. Drink now–2025.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This opens with a lovely fragrance of perfumed berries, violets, incense and sweet cake spices. Cinnamon, clove and white pepper accent the succulent red cherry and wild raspberry palate. It's fresh and elegant, with a smooth texture and supple tannins. Drink 2016–2029.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A solid Cabernet from this hot appellation, located well inland in Sonoma County. The wine is dry, tannic and fairly high in alcohol, although it wears its heat well. The fruit is very ripe in the direction of black currants and dark chocolate. Will hold and change over the next 6–8 years, turning drier and earthier, but you can drink it now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Rich and soft, this is full of pear and quince flavors that pack a punch of acidity. The fruitiness is offset by a yeasty character that adds notes of almond and spice.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Evocative hints of orange and tangerine peel softly rise from the glass. This leads onto zesty citrus flavors and a wonderfully streamlined, effortlessly powerful palate bursting with freshness and life. You may not readily associate Weinviertel with Riesling but in this single stony site it works incredibly well!",Austria-Niederösterreich-Riesling
"This Riserva blend of Negroamaro, Montepulciano and Malvasia Nera delivers very ripe and rich notes of strawberry jam and fruit preserves. The mouthfeel is polished and well-structured, but the wine exhibits a mature taste profile.",Italy-Southern Italy-Red Blend
"While there is a somewhat meaty edge to this wine, it also has good rich texture. It probably needs time to bring out the full potential of its ripe yellow fruits.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This is a big, rich Chardonnay, another monster lineup in Testarossa's single-vineyard series. Shows tightly knit apple and peach flavors very generously oaked, with the requisite additions of smoke, vanilla, and woody spices. There's something minerally in the middle that seems likely to preserve the wine, if you wish to age it. Very fine quality, and a super-good food wine.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This charming white opens with delicate aromas of pressed white flower, beeswax and orchard fruit. The palate offers green apple, citrus and an herbal note alongside brisk acidity.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"100% Cabernet Sauvignon all coming from Alder Ridge Vineyard, it has notes of cherry and dried herbs. The tannins are dry with a cranberry filled finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dark, dense, spicy and full of everything nice, including cola, berry, earth and richness. The palate has ideal ripeness and power, and the flavors are a clever mix of light herbs, spice, chocolate and blasting berry. Long and sultry on the finish, with tobacco and immense complexity. One of Chile's very best wines; a blend of Syrah, Carmenère, Cabernet and Merlot.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Red Blend
"This variety's signature dried- and fresh-herb aromas are on full display, with light barrel spices in the background. The palate brings lightly sweet plum and currant flavors that provide appeal.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Heady aromas of citrus and orchard fruit almost jump out of the glass. The savory, medium-bodied palate tastes of ripe pear, mature apple and creamy peach interspersed with energizing mineral notes. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors.",Italy-Southern Italy-Greco
"A rosé Champagne with aromas and flavors of cherries and strawberries blended with dry spices, like cinnamon. This would make a festive apéritif this holiday season.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"It's soft, slightly oxidized, and generic. It's pleasantly quaffable, marked in the finish by some rather bitter toast.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"A seductive nose, densely loaded with black currants and smoke, leads into a textural, single-vineyard, 100% Cabernet with great varietal presence and definition. It needs to breathe open, which puts on more flesh, and starts to unpack the layers. Streaks of mineral, iron, graphite and more cassis roll into the finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe and round, this has a strawberry flavor that is surrounded by dense tannins. It shows a fine line of fresh acidity, and it is ready to drink, although it will age for several years.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This is a great sunny day wine, starting with aromas of honeydew melon, ripe nectarine and lemongrass. There is a slightly peachy, bubblegum character once sipped, with lemon-lime soda in the midpalate and a flinty, gunmetal finish.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"This light and fruity wine has 80% Baga in its blend. It is juicy, full of acidity and bright with red-berry fruitiness. The wine is immediately attractive and ready to drink.",Portugal-Bairrada-Portuguese Red
"This soft wine has gentle ripe white fruits and lemon-juice flavors. It ends fresh and crisp, with a touch of creaminess to add richness. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Rosés are an extreme rarity from this appellation, let alone 100% varietal Tempranillo. Pale peach in color, aromas of strawberry hard candy, bubblegum and spice lead to dry well-measured fruit flavors. It delivers enjoyment.",US-Washington-Rosé
"As much rich as sweet, this is a honey- and dry botrytis-flavored wine, with tropical mango flavors complementing lemon acidity. It's a complex, intense wine, textured and ageworthy. Screwcap.",Austria-Burgenland-Austrian white blend
"The nose is shy but eventually offers suggestions of black cherry, underbrush, grilled herb and a balsamic note. The firm palate offers raspberry jam, licorice and a hint of coco alongside austere, drying tannins that leave an astringent finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Big, ripe and smoky, this wine is generous while having great freshness. It's packed with fresh strawberries and raspberries along with powerful tannins. The combination of structure and great fruit will allow this wine to age. Drink from 2022.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir

"This wine from Rick Grimm and winemaker Paul Lato shows stunning potential for this new vineyard. Blackberry, thyme, black pepper and crushed slate aromas lead to a tremendously savory, umami-packed palate, where bay leaf and stewed mushroom notes envelop a core of blackberry and black currant fruit. The structure is solid, and the finish is long and strong.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A deliciously satisfying wood-aged Port. It has an intense fruitiness, with layers of acidity and oxidated notes. It's concentrated, yet shows lightness and poise.",Portugal-Port-Port
"A dark, smoky smudge seems to cover the red-cherry notes on the nose. The palate is juicy and light, with this red-cherry nature at its core. Easy and light, it's a perfect fruit-driven summer red.",Austria-Burgenland-Zweigelt
"Extremely intriguing on the nose, this shows aromas of Meyer lemon, green banana and tangerines. Generous yellow fruits like melon and Gala apples show on the palate, which is soft with lemon-bar elements at first but then tightens around green apple skins and a peppery, herbal character.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Oaky aromas suggest sandalwood along with plum and blackberry. This feels lively but also tight and gripping, something that a few years on its side should tame. Ripe black-fruit flavors are savory on the backside. It is firmly structured, with a meaty flavor on the finish. Drink through 2026.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Sweet in orange and papaya fruit flavors, yet lacking the vital acidity needed for balance. The result is cloying.",US-California-Sémillon
"This Shiraz has a plucky nose of tart cherry, tobacco and pepper. The flavors of clove, tobacco and berry on the palate are fruity but balanced by the spice. Pair with cheeses, lamb.",South Africa-Western Cape-Shiraz
"This is not a showy wine, but the sense of reserve, good acidity, fresh flavors and good balance form an enjoyable picture that will be versatile with food.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A new effort from DDO, this drops Domaine Drouhin from the name, and puts the vineyard name front and center. It's young and well-crafted, with strawberry and cherry fruit. The potential is evident for an impressive site once the vines get some age under them.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Amidst cola and sassafras on the nose, there's a bit of rotting cherry funk and some compost pile aromas to this intriguing single-vineyard Syrah from the Los Alamos area. The little bit of cherry sweetness on the palate gets more serious with chopped herbs, tobacco and cedar.",US-California-Syrah
"This offers aromas of almond, citrus zest and orchard fruit. The firm, rich palate delivers lemon drop, white peach and yellow apple while bright acidity and small, persistent bubbles provide the framework. It ends crisp and refreshing.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"The land from which this wine comes was once owned by the Biondi-Santi family. It forms part of an 18-acre estate belonging to Sergio Rossi. It is a stunning wine, with a sense of fine poise combined with solid tannins and firm, ripe fruit. At the back of the palate is a lingering flavor ofviolets and sweet herbs. Drink from 2005; the wine should age well.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Vanilla, pear and a whiff of wintergreen make the nose intriguing, but after that it's commercial mango and pineapple flavors with a pithy finish. A sweet, overpumped Chardonnay.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Chardonnay
"Mirabelle is the darkest, chewiest, most tannic of the three clonal selection Pinots offered by Vidon. It's a Pinot in Cab clothing. Chewy, dense, ripe fruit keeps it all in proportion, a thick black cherry core with rings of chocolate. Think Saturn in a glass.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Lusciously ripe yet pristine white grapefruits, tangerines and lemons abound from nose to finish in this sleek, stately dry Riesling. It's lithe and lean on the palate yet piercing in concentration. High toned acidity and darker tones of smoke and nuts lend complexity to a long, meandering finish. Beautiful now but sure to meld beautifully through at least 2030.",Germany-Nahe-Riesling
"Produced by the Terravant facility in Buellton, this shows lots of smoked pork and bacon fat against a boysenberry-fruit frame on the nose. Flavors are quite sanguine, with iron and blood elements, as well as more smoke and some dried herbs.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Nearly seven years after harvest, it remains lively and vital. Pointed aromas of lemony oak, pencil lead and cassis are classy and a touch earthy. This is balanced in feel, but with penty of gas in the tank. Roasted, warm flavors of berry, plum, spice, herbs and pepper finish firm, with cocoa and nutmeg notes that introduce secondary tobacco and earth accents. Drink through 2019.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"This plump, succulent wine is a solid value. Understated toast frames pineapple and melon in this fruit-driven style. Drink this crisp, appealing quaffer now–2018.",Australia-Western Australia-Chardonnay
"This wine utilizes 40% neutral oak, 40% stainless steel and 20% new French barrels, and is fermented with native yeast. It's a deep, vibrant gold color, sporting sexy aromas of pineapple, pear and peach. The palate is fully ripe, round and forward, with luscious fruit flavors throughout.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"This powerful Pinot is not for the meek or easily afraid. It's a heavyweight in its prime, stemmy and unabashedly full-throttled in juicy Bing cherry, blackberry and raspberry. Though generous in style, it remains coiled in acidity, with springtime aromas of just-picked rose, proving beauty can come in a substantial package.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"With five years' bottle aging, this Champagne is just beginning to show some attractive signs of maturity. The toasty aroma is followed through on the palate and this toastiness has softened the tight mineral texture of the wine. Drink this balanced wine now.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"This is a bold wine with aromas like Concord grapes, and flavors so ripe they are almost jammy, but it also has lively acidity and moderate tannins to keep the texture fresh. There is little oak flavor to get in the way of the pure expression of the grapes.",US-California-Syrah
"The phenomenal 2010 vintage shows why this wine is considered Italy's top purebred Merlot. Revealing structure, finesse and mesmerizing depth, it delivers blackberries, currants, cedar, exotic spices and mocha alongside firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity. It's well balanced with fantastic length and while it's delicious now, hold for more complexity. Drink 2015–2030.",Italy-Tuscany-Merlot
"Dark, evolved and sophisticated, this brooding wine boasts rich concentration and a faithful portrayal of black currant and cherry. There's a pleasant touch of underbrush, licorice and espresso that catapult the wine into a higher level of intensity.",Italy-Tuscany-Prugnolo Gentile
Pinot Bianco from the Collio region of northeast Italy generally tends to deliver firm structure and texture. This wine is an excellent example of the variety because it balances density and heat versus elegance of aromas. Pair it with Thai or Chinese chicken dishes.,Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Bianco
"Robust in oak, this full-bodied expression of the variety is reduced on the palate, showing sizable tannin weight and length. Plum, dark cherry and dried herb combine to offer swirls of flavor.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Black color shows a depth of extraction in this earthy, burly wine. It reveals layers of leather, cedar and tobacco most, with a billowy tannin structure providing a foundation for additional elements of meaty black fruit and graphite.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"From a very warm site in pear country comes this Cabernet/Merlot blend. It shows ripe fruit, dense tannin, and some dark, toasted-coffee notes. The forward fruit is appealing, but the wine falls off in the middle and finishes quickly.",US-Oregon-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This cuvée features grapes from some of the vineyard's oldest vines. It's a light, elegant mix of pomegranate and cherry pie flavors with plenty of natural acidity behind it. Cola and dried herb highlights add complexity, and a persistent minerality buoys the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This Cabernet Sauvingon includes 6% each Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. It's herbal and austere, though not at all tricked up with vanilla flavor. Short and to the point, it's a good every day red for heartier meals.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Warm, plummy and inviting, with plum and black cherry fruit framed by crisp acidity. The combination makes for a juicy, mouthwatering finish in this fine everyday red.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend

"Earthy black-fruit aromas set up a rubbery, heavy palate with plenty of oak and related resin. This tastes mostly of oak and clove, with savory blackberry notes resting at the base. A solid salty choppy finish shows a tight grip and moderate roughness.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This off-dry wine is solid, with a mix of lemons and oranges in a broad, fruity midpalate. A thick streak of sweet tea comes up also, and the wine, though blocky and one-dimensional, is quite nice chilled down as an apéritif.",Canada-Ontario-Riesling
"One has to dig deep to discover much in the way of aromas on this rosé, which is made of indeterminate grapes. Dry, dark pink in color, its flavors are quite simple.",US-California-Rosé
"This opens softly, with murky aromas of tomato and prune. It feels heavy and dense, with big tannins and mild acidity. The flavors of prune, mocha, fudge and stewed berry are rich and weighty. This is dense and ripe, a touch flat.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Decent, by most definitions, but a clumsy wine. It's hot in high alcohol, simple and jammy sweet in blackberries and cherries, and the oak sticks out like a sore thumb. Not going anywhere.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"There is something delicate and almost floral about this slender, fresh Grüner. Tinged with pear drop, the light, easy-drinking palate is as soft as it is fresh but also reveals some peppery verve. Drink soon.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"Tight, acidic and dry in youth, this Pinot has a don't-drink-me-now austerity. It resists efforts to break it down at every point. However, it seems well able to age, given the balance, and the wealth of cherry, pomegranate, persimmon and rhubarb fruit. Cellar this fine wine until at least 2014.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This edition of Dosaggio Zero shows delicate harmony and complexity with layers of stone fruit, citrus, almond and white flower. Zesty perlage is enhanced by more stone fruit flavors on the silky finish.",Italy-Lombardy-Sparkling Blend

"With an alluring bouquet of fresh-cut jasmine and citrus, this is a light, vibrant wine, bristling in acidity that's fruity and briny in equal measure. Clean, crisp and fermented in stainless steel, it offers everything one wants in a refreshing quaff.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"High in acidity, this wine seems unbalanced. The fruit is distinct from the structure, leaving crispness contrasted with firm tannins.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese Red
"Aromas of violet, iris, ripe black-skinned fruit, dried grape and a whiff of tobacco lead the way on this full-bodied charmer. The smooth, structured palate delivers dried cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and cake spice while velvety tannins provide support.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend

"Produced from Grand Cru vineyards, this pale-colored rosé is warm and ripe. An attractive blend of red fruits and crisp acidity is rounded out with a soft, full aftertaste. It could be drunk as an apéritif, although it would be better with food.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Clean, fully loaded blackberry and dark plum aromas are smooth and subtle. In the mouth, this Tempranillo is chunky and solidly built, with earthy, roasted flavors of berry and plum. Savory, meaty flavors define the finish on  this dark-leaning, affordable Rioja.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Fairly hot and heavy at first, as alcohol blows up your nostrils. But let it settle and you'll get dark, sultry aromas of leather and black plum in front of edgy, mildly citric cassis and red plum flavors. The blend is Carmenère, Petit Verdot and Shiraz, which is not something found on every shelf. Like its Cab Franc-Petit Verdot partner, Anke Blend-2 is good but not great.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Red Blend
"This leads with black-skinned berry, violet and eucalyptus aromas. The solid palate doles out blackberry jam, clove and black pepper notes alongside polished tannins. Enjoy through 2020.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera

"This is a ripe, fresh and fruity wine that's filled out with a tangy, mineral texture. Grapefruit and lime juice flavors give a zesty feel as well as intense acidity. It is ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Honeyed red-apple slices, ripe papaya, honeysuckle and honeydew aromas are nicely cut by wet-cement minerality on this nose of this 71% Viognier and 29% Roussanne blend. It's tight and reserved on the palate, tart with lime and apple-juice flavors.",US-California-Rhône-style White Blend
"This wine presents an intriguing mix of green, nearly vegetal, aromas and tropical and stone fruit. It's plump and mouthfilling, then finishes on a ripe, honeyed note. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Made predominantly with Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of lemon zest, acacia honey and a toasted note. The lively elegant palate offers yellow apple, apricot, vanilla and a touch of baking spice. It's well balanced, with bright acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Chardonnay
"Camphor, eucalyptus, berry and a whiff of cellar floor lead the nose. The bright palate shows Morello cherry, star anise and aromatic herb alongside tightly wound tannins that leave a firm, austere finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"92-94 Very structured wine, its fruit tannins dominant. It has power and extreme concentration. Dark and dense.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A sound, everyday Pinot Grigio, with good citrus and spice flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Gets the nod for simple richness.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"Possibly the best Walter Clore to date, this is firm, with substantial dark-fruit flavors swathed in swirls of loam, blood, sweet tomato and red licorice. The relative coolness of the vintage seems to have allowed extra details to emerge, and the barrel aging has been handled sensitively.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a sophisticated and ultrasmooth wine. A spicy, almost sweet aroma of classy oak leads to rich strawberry and plum flavors that glide lightly on the supple texture, which has just enough tannin and acidity to keep the wine well balanced.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This is a powerful wine, complex and structured. From one of the Douro's top quintas, now fully on form, this is full of red fruits, blackberries and acidity that's still so young. Concentrated and demanding aging, this should be kept at least until 2018.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Aromas of toasted almond and yellow apple follow over to the lean vivacious palate along with citrus zest. It's simple and refreshing, with crisp acidity and a vigorous perlage.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Lime, green bean, asparagus and a blast of punchy sweat greet you on the nose of this zesty, acidic, lean-bodied SB. Limited, tight flavors of lemon, lime and bell pepper finish tart and gritty, with a suggestion of sourness. Tasted two times with somewhat mixed results; this note and score reflects both tastings.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Rounded red apple with an edge of peppery spice and a whole lot of grapefruit zest makes for a lively, textured and vivid palate. This is fresh, pure and totally appetizing. The finish similarly leaves the impression of peppery red apples.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"This is every bit as good as the winery's Clave de Tábula, which costs twice as much. An aromatic opening of fig, prune and blackberry comes with graphite, cola and attractive oak notes. This is intense and shows powerful acidity in support of blackberry, toast and dark, spicy flavors. A medium-long finish with toast and licorice is proper and not overdone. Drink from 2014–2022.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This is a rich wine that still retains intense freshness. Botrytised grapes were harvested in early December, giving rich honey and spice flavors. White peach and spiced pears give freshness as well as rich texture to this young wine. Drink as its opulence comes into its own, from 2019.",France-Southwest France-Petit Manseng

"This is a gorgeously luxurious wine, vibrant and alive in blackberry and raspberry, a savory lining of red currant providing its edge. The big tannin presence speaks to cellaring, through 2022, but a decant should help, too, allowing the herbal and fruit components to come into balance with its powerful density.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Gold in color and heavy on the nose, this Catalonian white blend is woody but also smells mealy and a touch sweaty. The palate is round and plump, while flavors of banana and oak finish resiny before shifting toward bitterness.",Spain-Catalonia-White Blend

"This wine is made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, with tiny additions of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A minty, menthol streak is strong on the nose, veering into almost eucalyptus, while dried herb and a shot of gunpowder provide additional savory aromas and flavors. Big tannins need time in the glass to mellow.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Ripe and voluptuous, with very rich, long-lasting berry, cherry, mocha and spice flavors, liberally oaked and wrapped into fine, sturdy tannins. Lacks a bit of complexity, but otherwise a beautiful Merlot that trades on the variety's opulently fleshy sensuality.",US-California-Merlot

"Here's a lusty, rugged Zinfandel marked by strong, superripe flavors. The blackberries and plums veer into currants and raisins, and finish spicy and dry, while enormously high alcohol gives the impression of heat. But that's Zinfandel for you. Needs a grilled flank steak to play against.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This crisp wine has plenty of acidity as well as lively fruits. The structure and texture are light and lifted, with a clean aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend

"Buoyantly fragrant, this voluptuous Chardonnay bursts of mango, guava and berry aromas. The palate is a bit more subdued, suggesting fresh apple and pear. Fruity, fresh and uncomplicated, it's balanced neatly by a flash of acidity on the midpalate. Drink now through 2019.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Operative words to describe this wine might include seamless and harmonious. There's such wonderful integration of fruit and oak that it's difficult to pick this wine's flavor components apart—it's a whirl of cassis and cedar, yet restrained; full-bodied, rich and dense without being heavy. Long and velvety on the finish, with enough soft tannins to last it 10–15 years.",Australia-Western Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon

"With low alcohol and a sweet finish, this pleasant wine is packed with juicy flavors of tropical fruits such as pineapples, papayas and golden mangoes. It has a rich vein of wild honey that persists into the finish.",US-California-Viognier
"A kitchen-sink blend of varieties with Merlot (44%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (26%) taking the lead, this wine offers appealing aromas that suggest high-toned, sweet barrel spices, plum and herbs. It's loaded with cranberry, cherry and plum flavors with a rich mouthfeel that keeps the interest high.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This is an outstanding value in a Willamette Valley Pinot Noir—soft, subtle and spicy, with sweet strawberry and cherry fruit. All neutral oak fermented, the mouthfeel is smooth and supple, and the flavors have a sexy, delicious quality that says “drink me now!”",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Oak and earth intermingle around robust aromas of wet forest floor in this vineyard-designated Pinot that hails from a high-elevation site. Small in production, it offers intense, full-bodied raspberry and blackberry steeped in smoky spice and smooth texture.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"With its lively mousse and crisp acidity, this red-currant-flavored wine is fresh and tight. The fruitiness is still right up front. Another few months in bottle will soften and round it out very well. Drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy-Sparkling Blend
"Robustly citrusy notes of orange peel and tangerine show brightly in this brisk, off-dry wine. It is approachably fresh and fruity, but nuanced by a touch of crushed stone and whiffs of rose petal on the finish. Drink now through 2018.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Bright and light on its feet, this is a pleasant and sunny wine that's loaded with crisp citrus and green apple aromas and flavors. There's a subtle, surprising smoothness to the palate, though zippy acidity picks up on the midpalate and through the clean finish. Drink now.",South Africa-Coastal Region-Chenin Blanc

"This straightforward, inviting Barolo boasts classic Nebbiolo aromas of rose, leather, berry spice and tilled earth. It's not loaded with complexity, but the sour cherry, black pepper and clove flavors are delicious. It closes on a note of subtle oak alongside a drying, tannic finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Leather, menthol and underbrush aromas come together on this. The straightforward palate is already evolved, showing dried Morello cherry, licorice and a hint of clove before a rather abrupt, astringent finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"The vineyard is famous for producing ripe, luscious Pinots stuffed with massive fruit. Many wineries have dipped into it over the years. Krutz's rendition is dry, balanced and full-bodied, with relatively high alcohol framing raspberry, cherry, cola, red plum, exotic spice and sandalwood flavors. It should age well through 2020–2022.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine has the kind of beefy, muscular character that one expects in a Cab, with its earthy berry and leathery spice nose, and a layering of tobacco smoke, black pepper and rich berry on the palate. Decent tannins and minerality add to the weight. A good wine with ageable appeal.",US-New York-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Compelling minerality on the nose, Refined and focused floral aromas with ample ripe stone fruit and a hint of petrol. Racy acidity and lovely taut palate with generous layers of juicy ripe peach, apricot and nectarine.  Strong minerality prevails across the palate leading to a lingering finish. Very balanced.",France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"Here's a charming sparkler with delicate aromas suggesting spring blossom and red berry.

It finishes clean.",Italy-Central Italy-Lambrusco
"This Merlot smells rooty, with licorice and mint to boot. A wide, sort of flabby palate is, at its base, oaky as can be; there's also stewed plum and herbal blackberry flavors in front of a blocky, chunky finish.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Merlot
"With more than four years of bottle age, this Cabernet is soft, elegant and lovely to drink now. It has subtle but complex black currant, mocha and cedar flavors, along with rich tannins that will pair well with steak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, followed by Merlot and a curious 1% of Sauvignon Blanc, this penny-colored wine is herbal in jalapeño and not terribly fruit-forward. It's extremely low in terms of alcohol and finishes diluted.",US-California-Rosé

"The aromas are barely a whisper, with notes of citrus and herb. It drinks dry with lightly concentrated fruit flavors. The variety seems hard to find.",US-Washington-Pinot Grigio

"Inviting aromas of buttercream, vanilla bean and lemon custard-laced pastries draw the nose into this wine, made by three families. Two members of the group, Rich Aurilia and Dave Roberts, are former pro baseball players. It's very balanced on the palate, with white peach, honey and citrus, and a judicious amount of butter on the edges.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Shows its youth in the assaultive tannins that hit the palate with astringent toughness. But underneath are rich, pure and vibrant blackberry, cherry and cassis flavors. A very fine wine, as this bottling tends to be, but one in serious need of cellaring. It's already throwing some sediment, suggesting it's impatient to evolve. Give it another 6–8 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Definitely a step up from the regular Chardonnay; this is more substantial, bringing in some mineral, citrus rind and spice along with apple and pear flavors.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Pristine grapefruit, lemon and cantaloupe perfume this bold, fruit-forward Gewürztraminer. While off dry in style and densely concentrated in apricot and citrus flavors, it's balanced keenly in acidity and finishes with mineral refreshment.",US-New York-Gewürztraminer
"Roast beef, black currant, caked purple flowers, caramel and fudge come together on the wondrous nose of this blend of 75% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. Strong chocolate flavors kick off the palate, followed by blueberry, violet, espresso, dill and licorice, all clinging to sticky, mouthcoating tannins. It delivers lots of body and power.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Lemon and tart apple with some overtones of riper Golden Delicious are the fruity hallmarks of this easy-drinking but superrefreshing summer wine. The apple taste stays and makes you go back for more easy, pleasant fruit.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Mazzei, the family behind Fonterutoli in Chianti, is the maker of this 100% Sangiovese, which offers a strong, piercing nose of earth, leather, red fruit and oak. If given time in the glass, the muscular palate loosens its stern grip, unveiling a nice underlay of plum, berries and oak. Far better than pedestrian, this is a sturdy, well-made Tuscan red.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This opens with aromas suggesting dark-skinned berry, ground pepper and a whiff of flint. The solid, chewy palate shows mature plum, espresso and vanilla alongside ripe, robust tannins. Drink through 2018.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Lagrein
"From a vineyard planted on the edge of Freestone by James MacPhail of MacPhail Family Wines and respected grower Jim Pratt, this wine opens with a splash of white pepper that persists on the soft, silky palate.

"Earth, olive and ample berry aromas vie with herbal scents to create a textbook Maipo Valley bouquet. The palate is packed and full, with olive, sweet oak, herb and cassis flavors. Finishes long but herbal tasting, with lasting flavors of olive and tobacco.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Three elements, already in balance, contribute to the success of this wine. First, the rich fruit, juicy blackberry and mulberry, lifted by acidity. Second, the new wood, which spices the fruit but is already smoothing out the third element, the dark firm tannic layer.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The fig, licorice and spice aromas seem somewhat dried out and tired. The cherry and cranberry flavors are smooth, with the tannins showing some grit. Drink now.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Forward and rich, with flavors of luscious red cherries spiked with cola and purple flowers, this is an easy-drinking yet undeniably tasty blend of Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Big, chunky tannins and a spray of sour-cherry acidity add depth and verve to the midpalate.",US-New York-Meritage
"Light on the nose. The flavor profile leans toward cranberry, but there seems to be a faint pickled note, too. The feel is juicy and acidic, so it's fresh.",Chile-Central Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The wine is concentrated and structured. It has blackberry fruits that give weight as well as firm tannins both from fruit and from wood. As it develops, the wine will fill out with rich berry fruits and the tannins will soften. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This off-dry Gewürztraminer opens with a powerful bouquet of bergamot, violet and rose perfume that seeps into the palate. The aromatics are a bit overwhelming, but bright tangerine flavors stand up well. It's a light-footed wine that finishes briskly.",Germany-Pfalz-Gewürztraminer
"One of an impressive range of wines by this producer from the Beaujolais crus, this wine comes from the mineral-driven flint soil of the slopes beneath the famous windmill that gives this appellation its name. It is powerful and dense, full of jammy red fruits as well as acidity and structured tannins. Drink from 2019.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Basically good, with jammy berry flavors, but ultimately clumsy, especially for the price. Shows overripe fruit and green tannins. Feels sharp toward the finish. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",US-California-Meritage

"This blend—mainly Grenche Blanc and Roussanne—is fairly neutral on the nose, but weighty and rich on the palate, where it delivers succulent notes of pineapple, perked by a sprinkling of white pepper. That peppery spice picks up in intensity on the finish, imparting vibrancy and length. Drink now.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style White Blend
"Old vines in a field blend are the basis of this dense and concentrated wine. It is powered both by its tannins and by dark black fruits.

"It's easy to drink this medium-bodied, pleasant Cabernet and enjoy the light herb and cherry flavors. Not tannic in spite of 10% Tannat grapes blended in, it feels soft and tastes mild on the finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This is a sumptuous, well-crafted wine, nearly 100% varietal and dark purple in color.

"Loamy berry, blackberry pie and pastry aromas are like the red carpet at a big event. This is the epitome of a lush, layered, structured Tempranillo. Borderline syrupy flavors of blackberry, coffee and mocha end with chocolate and vanilla richness as well as lusty boldness. Hold until 2018, then drink through 2025.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"This starts out well, with some varietal fruit and pepper in the nose. But the aggressive vanilla and coffee flavors suggest that the oak treatments were not well integrated, and the tannins have a bitterly harsh edge to them.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This fragrant wine will entice with you its heady perfume of woodland berry, wild herb, graphite and blue flower. It's still quite young and tightly wound, delivering strawberry, cherry, white pepper and thyme wrapped up in taut tannins. Vibrant acidity provides balance and energy but give this time to fully develop. Drink 2023–2033.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"Makes an interesting contrast with the J.J.

The sweetness is finely balanced by mouthwatering acidity on the finish.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Slightly lighter than other takes on the grape, this wine shows hibiscus, black plum, grape soda and gravel on the nose.

Some sales proceeds go to a medical relief organization.",US-California-Mourvèdre

"Made without oak, this Riesling is slightly sweet with sugary orange and peach flavors. It lacks the acidity to balance the sweetness, which makes the finish cloying.",US-California-Riesling

Vigne di Proprietà is an estate-grown wine with dark concentration and distinctive aromas of black cherry and mature fruit (likely explained by the hot vintage). The wine offers chewy fullness and opulence backed by sweet spice flavors and velvety tannins. It has power too and the alcohol definitely shows as the wine warms in the glass.,Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This Cab already has nearly five years on it, but it still has tough, bitter tannins. That raises the question: will it age? Fruit-wise, it's rich in blackberries, cherries and currants, with an exotic cassis finish. The acidity is crisp and zesty. But those acids and tannins are likely to outlive the fruit.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"It's rare to see a varietal bottling of Franc from this appellation. This one offers aromas of fresh and dried herbs along with cherry, still seeming a bit locked-up. The cherry and raspberry flavors are on the lighter side of medium bodied, trailing toward the finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"While the Finger Lakes region is better known for Riesling, this gorgeously composed single-vineyard Cabernet Franc sets a benchmark for American red wine.

"With use of 30% new French oak and the remainder in neutral barrels, this wine offers aromas of brioche, lemon custard and white flowers on the nose.

Decent now, but better to drink 2018–2022.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A smooth, powerful Cabernet, made solidly in the modern style of exceedingly ripe fruit wrapped into soft tannins and then given an application of sweet oak. Shows many of the same characteristics of Napa Cabs costing far more, which makes it a relative bargain.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lapostolle's basic Cab scores big in the fine '01 vintage. It features a deep nose of tire rubber, blackberry and rusticity. The palate is high-octane and deep, with plenty of ripe, tannic black fruit. And the finish is round and lengthy. It should age well for a couple of years.

Full flavors of tobacco and spice carry the wine smoothly over the palate.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Named after a local landmark, this is rich for a Vinho Verde, a soft blend of Alvarinho and Trajadura that brings out white fruits as well as a more citrus character. It's very aromatic, fruity and worth keeping a few months.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White
"Briny apple and nectarine aromas are within the proper framework of brut nature. Citric and stone-fruit acidity makes for a racy palate, while this tastes mostly of peach and nectarine along with some salt and brine. A firm finish is acidic and dry.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"This lightly volatile wine shows notes of cherry cola, dried fruit and woodspice. It doesn't drink entirely dry with the alcohol riding high on the medicine-cabinet flavors.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's a slightly charry, roasted or asphalt top note to this wine's aromas, but the wine's flavors are an intriguing mix of cola, rhubarb and red berries, ending with mouthwatering raspberries coming to the fore. It's a full-bodied, creamy-textured wine that should be enjoyed over the next few years.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"An impressive wine that presents a full bouquet with bready, leesy, toasty aromas, and intriguing lemon and caramel hints. The palate sports attractive fruit and spice flavors that are both complex and lovely, if a challenge to define. There’s a long full finish to this top-notch American sparkler.",US-California-Champagne Blend
"Earthy aromas of tilled soil, bell pepper, ripe plum and a whiff of barnyard waft out of the glass. The palate is a bit rustic, displaying fig, ground black pepper, graphite and a gamey note alongside velvety tannins. Drink soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Syrah
"Great price for a Chardonnay that tastes like it costs a lot more. Although it's unoaked, it's very rich in passionfruit, pineapple, peach and vanilla cream flavors, with a honeyed finish. Easy to find, with 5,000 cases produced.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is an intense, almost too strong, interpretation of Ripasso that offers high alcohol and lasting aromas of tar, asphalt and maraschino cherry. Sweet barbecue spice and chewy cherry nuances appear on the close.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"The aromas are wound up at present, with notes of generous barrel spices, dried herb, dark fruit and pencil lead. The dark-cherry flavors are smooth and supple, backed by fine-grained tannins.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
The fragrant mix of flowers and fruit introduces a wine already moving into secondary fruit flavors. Strawberry and cherry components are softened with highlights of cola and caramel. There's a hint of orange creeping into the hue around the rim. Drink now through 2018.,US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"With layers of coffee, spice and cedar enveloping scents of ripe black fruit and bramble, Hazlitt's Cab is beautifully composed on the nose. It's lean in style and body, however, with a black plum palate marked by whiffs of sweet tomato and green leaves on the finish.",US-New York-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine starts with a spicy nose of black cherry, pepper, and a touch of green pepper. The palate offers lean and spicy flavors of green pepper, herbs and cherry. The wine is a touch angular, but paired with a richer dish, will balance out.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"White flowers and pine fronds perfume crisp yellow peach and apricots in this delicate, yet intensely concentrated Riesling. Zesty, cutting and spry, it's a bright star for Riesling in a region traditionally not known for the variety. Made from “virgin” seedless berries known for their intense aroma and flavor concentration.",US-New York-Riesling
"Peach and floral aromas are ethereal and reach out. This is round and full on the palate, but minerally and cut by citric acidity. Flavors or orange, mango and caramel end with ripe peach and melon flavors. Drink through 2016.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Dry, spicy red-fruit and sawdust aromas are elegant. This is fresh, crisp and refined on the palate, with oak, plum, raspberry and tomato flavors that dry out and narrow down on a tight, well-framed finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"An waft of leather saddle opens this release from an historic Diamond Mountain site celebrating 40 years of wines with this vintage. Soft and refined, it's a complex expression of cassis, black currant and mountain tannins, well integrated and age-worthy. The finish is lengthy in a touch of coffee. Drink now through 2022.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"A simple and candied Pinot Noir, this has tasty raspberry and cherry jam flavors, plus rich, oak-derived notes of buttered toast.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Dry, tart and citrusy. Offers streamlined flavors of lemons, limes, tannic herb tea and minerals, with oak and lees adding much-needed richness. It's elegant in a Chablisian way, but trades fruity opulence for a more complex, connoisseur's austerity. Drink now, and don't over-chill.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A deep, developed wine with cola, licorice and prune aromas. The palate is poised and balanced even if it's rich and very ripe. Layered in the mouth, with plum, prune, chocolate, coffee and fine spice, which is about as complete a package as you'll find with Malbec. Cabernet and Syrah; drink now through 2015.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"The winery has an outstanding track record with Oregon varieties. Now that they've moved southward, the results are average. Their first Napa Merlot is rich and well-structured, but kind of sweet and simple in vanilla-flavored cherries, currants and black raspberries, with a chocolate edge. The alcohol level, in the mid-15s, is a problem.",US-California-Merlot
"Eucalyptus leaf, black raspberry and black cherry aromas combine for a sultry nose on this bottling, one of this producer's many expressions of individual sites in the region. Herbes du provence show on the sip, then flavors settle into gravel and graphite minerality, all based on dark strawberry and plum fruit.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This has a very deep color, even for this notoriously dark varietal. Complex aromas blend rich fruit with smoky, peppery notes, followed by mouthcoating flavors like dark-chocolate-covered blackberries. It doesn't mess around with overtly sweet oak, but stays dry, concentrated and focused. Best after 2020.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Firmly tannic wine with blackberry fruits and a woody, stalky character. The hard-edged and spicy fruit is on the green side.",France-Provence-Rhône-style Red Blend
"On the bank opposite the Sauternes region, Cadillac, with its fortified castle, is home to some richly liquorous wines. This 2010 is honeyed and opulent, with a smooth texture and just a bite of botrytis. Drink this peach- and bitter orange-flavored wine now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This is a supple, medium- to full-bodied red for drinking over the next few years. The plummy flavors are a bit earthy, dark and indistinct, but pleasant enough, and the wine's silky finish features a bright burst of red fruit.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Made from Pinot Noir, this is an orange-tan color and offers dried, oxidized aromas of orange and tangerine. Foamy and coarse on the palate, with a sour-orange flavor, it finishes without much verve.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"This blend of Grenache and Cinsault comes from the small cru area of La Londe. Produced from organic grapes, it is pale in color, although rich in texture and with touches of white peach and strawberry. With its pepper and tangy texture it is a style of rosé that could well age. Drink from 2018.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This seems a bit oaky on the nose, where scents of baking spices and cedar dominate, but those elements are balanced out on the palate, where blackberries, plums and black currants comes to the fore. This is a full-bodied, ripe-textured wine worth a look. Drink now–2025.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Different and intriguing, this tightly wound wine has white pepper aromas, tart cherry and raspberry flavors and an engaging, astringent mouthfeel. High in acidity and relatively low in body, it has a vibrancy and restraint that will benefit from more time in the bottle. Best after 2019.",US-California-Mourvèdre
"A blend of 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay, this conveys a subtle fragrance of rose, apple and a whiff of toasted hazelnut. The savory palate offers Marasca cherry and strawberry alongside a note of pastry cream backed up by crisp acidity and a lively perlage. It's a great deal at this price point.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sparkling Blend
"Sharply defined aromas, with a little funk at the base, lead into tart red fruits and flavors of slightly bitter herbs. The fruit fades quickly, leaving tart flavors of stem and leaf in its wake.",US-Washington-Syrah
"A blend of Stillwater Creek and Dineen vineyard fruit, aromas of assorted dried herbs, coffee and barrel spices intermingle. The dark-fruit flavors are elegant, polished and reserved, supported by lightly grainy tannins.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Tempranlillo is not the most common base for California rosé, but this might change some minds. It veers into the orange spectrum of pink color, and smells like a grapefruit spritzer. On the palate, there's lemon bar, almond paste, and bubblegum, but any perceived sweetness is wiped away by brisk acidity and a slightly bitter quality too. The layers of flavor are impressive.",US-California-Rosé
"Aromas of herbs, dates and licorice lead to reserved, silky-feeling flavors that show multiple layers and detail on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (59%), Merlot (26%) and Cabernet Franc. It's only ramps up with additional time in the glass.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Sharp in acidity and bone dry, this is a good, everyday Pinot Noir. It shows a properly silky texture, and flavors of cola, cherries, red currants and cedar. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Tasty and easy to drink, this has blackberry, black currant and cola flavors that finish seemingly sweet and oaky. It's an intense wine that doesn't seem likely to make gains with age, so drink up after an hour or two in the decanter.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Highly aromatic wine, with upfront herbaceous fruits that could give New Zealand Sauvignons a run for their money. What gives it an extra element is a creamy applesauce flavor that smooths the wine and makes it richer.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Perfumed berry, fragrant blue flower, cake spice and leather are just some of the alluring scents you find on this firmly structured red. The elegant, full-bodied palate offers red cherry, raspberry, clove, menthol and licorice alongside a backbone of tightly wound but refined tannins and bright acidity. Give this a few more years to fully develop. Drink 2019–2025.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nerello Mascalese
"Vanilla, coconut and baking spice aromas are at the fore, with the wood primary. The palate is rich and full bodied, with dark fruit and oak spice flavors. There are some good things going on but the oak—half new American and half seasoned French—rides right over them.",US-Washington-Syrah
"A complex Champagne, with its apricot, green plum and pink grapefruit flavors, mixed with a rich, creamy texture and soft acidity. The final tastes are of lychees, with some toastiness.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend

"Fragrant blue flower, plum, cake spice and a whiff of leather are some of the aromas you'll find on this stunning wine.

It's open and well balanced, with firm, polished tannins. Drink through 2020.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This is a firmly structured and full-bodied wine with great grip in the texture and lots of oak flavor and tannin. The rich fruit flavors are dominated by the grip now, but that should change with time. It's best to drink after 2018.",US-California-Barbera
"Named for brand co-founder Janie Master, this wine shows peach ripeness and dried herb sharpness on the nose, along with a slightly sweet reductive funk. The flavors offer lime on nectarine, with a nice tension between perceived sweetness and the sour/bitter side of the grape.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a new cuvée for Trisaetum, from a vineyard in the Red Hills of Dundee. It shows some old vine character in its brambly, Burgundian elegance. Light flavors of raspberry and cherry float above a bed of clay, yet there is enough muscle for the wine to extend gracefully through a lingering finish, with a lick of chocolate. Enjoy it over the next decade or more.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Chanson owns four acres, a quarter of this premier cru. This 2011 is smooth, rich and very elegant. Fruitiness is striated by a mineral, tight texture that gives a touch of steeliness. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Aromas of spiced blueberry, grilled herbs, cooking spice and a whiff of leather lead the nose of this blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The savory palate offers ripe plum, crushed black cherry, black pepper and mint alongside polished tannins. A licorice note marks the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Another fine Chardonnay from this producer. It's typical of the vineyard, showing intensely concentrated tropical and citrus fruit and green apple flavors, enhanced with mouthwatering acidity. Vertical tastings of this bottling show its ability to slowly evolve in the bottle over as much as eight years.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries and mocha make this taste almost of candied fruits. Despite how juicy it is, this wine finishes dry and firm in tannins.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Slightly pale pink in color, this 50% Pinot Noir and 50% Chardonnay sparkling wine offers rosé-like aromas, dominated by watermelon water. The vibrant bubbles release bubblegum ester, lime and melon on the palate, making for an excellent brunch wine.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"A curious mix of 77% Pinot Gris and 33% Chardonnay from a sought-after vineyard site, Buddy's is oaky, salty and thick, with a floral bouquet that lightens its load and represents the Pinot Gris component well. It may need more time to harmonize.",US-California-White Blend
"This kitchen sink blend combines 12 varieties, from Syrah and Malbec to Tinta Cao and Bastardo, and offers coffee, dark chocolate and beef char on the nose. More coffee arises on the palate along with blackberry, black cherry, unsweetened cocoa powder and vanilla.",US-California-Red Blend
"All coming from Stillwater Creek Vineyard, this leads with aromas of green herbs, dark fruit and milk chocolate. It's hedonistic in style with layers of fruit flavors and tart acids that seem a bit out of place.",US-Washington-Syrah
"How can such lightness, such supple slenderness, come with such full flavor? Visions of swirling citrus are made manifest here. Mandarin, kumquat, tangerine: they all dance and flit around a central seam of freshness. Lovely and almost irresistible now, but sure to advance most gracefully.",Austria-Kamptal-Riesling
"Burly in shape, with broad shoulders, ample alcohol and densely packed mineral flavors. Flashes of honey and gingery spice lighten the scene somewhat, but this slightly oily Riesling is darker and more brooding than most. The lingering finish is nearly dry.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"This wine lives up to its name with generous aromas of lychee, jasmine, apricot, and honeysuckle. It drinks off dry, with mouthful of stone-fruit flavors that are easygoing and immensely enjoyable.",US-Washington-White Blend
"One of Santa Barbara County's pioneer properties delivers an aromatically luscious wine, with aromas of white flowers, French toast, quince and lime sorbet on the nose. It's a bit like sipping perfume of tuberose and honeysuckle, yet there is bouncy acidity and chalky minerality, ensuring an emerging shelf life through 2018.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A hint of dill lends curious contrast to bright sour-cherry and raspberry flavors in this full-bodied wine. Supple on the palate and framed by the softest of tannins, it finishes briskly with a kick of cranberry acidity.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
Dried herb and wood spice aromas are followed by sappy black fruit flavors backed by a light squeeze of tannins. There's no mistaking the warm vintage it comes from.,US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This elegant blend of stainless- and barrel-aged lots captures the fresh fruit flavors of red apples, kiwi and lime, letting just a hint of barrel toast creep into the finish. It's leesy and bracing, finished at 14.8% alcohol but tasting much lighter.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Made from a majority of Pinot Noir, this reserve-tier wine lives up to its label, showing a dry swath of wild strawberry and orange preserve among a creamy center of integrated acidity and depth. It's a delight with complexity and crispness working well together.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"This wine has potential, with ripe berry fruits and soft tannins that are already well integrated. It is dense, showing a structure that will broaden out as the wine ages. Drink this juicy, fruity wine from Vignobles Dulon from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"La Nerthe is usually quite structured, so while the 2007 is riper and creamier than most vintages, it still retains decent acidity to balance things out. Leather, spice and cherry flavors pick up hints of coffee and chocolate on the finish. Drink it over the next 10–12 years.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This medium-bodied Riesling shows some already-evolving notes of honey, truffle and petrol wrapped around its core of apple and citrus. Seems a little on the sweeter side of the trocken spectrum.",Germany-Nahe-Riesling

"Backed by the winery's well-earned reputation for dry Riesling out of the Napa Valley, this offers pretty aromatics of orange blossom and honeysuckle followed by rich layers of peach, pear and a streak of honey on the finish.",US-California-Riesling
"Laetitia for years has been separately bottling blocks of their large estate vineyard, looking for sections that can stand on their own. La Coupelle is its latest experiment. It's certainly a huge, concentrated wine, vast in cherry pie, cola and new oak flavors, with the weight of Grenache. Good as it is, it's a little heavy-handed; sometimes less is more.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This opens with bright fruit notes of blueberry and wild cherry, followed by savory touches of exotic spice and green tea. It offers heft and endurance without the chewy thickness found in some Amarone.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Very dry and dusty, this blend of Carricante and Catarratto does a great job of showing the volcanic characteristics of Mt. Etna. There is fruit in the form of citrus, pear and melon, and the wine presents a tangy grapefruit finish, with a pretty mineral nuance as well.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"Half Malbec, half Petit Verdot (hence Petit Bec), this rough and tumble red has plenty of earthy tannic power. Rustic and sharp, with barely ripe fruit, it is similar to a cru Bordeaux, but with a little more meat on its bones.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This late release offers a good look at how the better Oregon white wines can improve with a few additional years in the bottle. Smooth and rich, it mixes pineapple, Asian pear and honeysuckle scents and flavors. Good verve and a light, pleasant hint of fresh herb.",US-Oregon-Pinot Blanc
"Sweet, simple and fruity, this light-bodied wine smells floral, tastes appley and feels soft and sugary to sip.",US-California-Muscat Canelli
"A fading wine with a brown-gold color and oxidized aromas mixed with leftover barrel resin and lacquer. The palate is resiny and thick feeling, with Sherried flavors of old wood, butterscotch, buttered apple and peach. More resin and pepper flavors work the finish.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Chardonnay
"Aromas of baked plum, exotic spice and vanilla almost jump out of the glass. The aromas follow through to the full-bodied, savory palate along with ripe black cherry, blackberry and mocha while velvety tannins give it a smooth, polished texture. It closes on a confectionary note.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"This well-made wine offers cherry pie flavors, evoking fruit but also crust, with excellent concentration and length. Despite its modest alcohol, it's a persistent, powerful rosé with enough concentration to stand up to entrées as rich as roast pork or chicken.",US-Oregon-Rosé
"Aromas of banana, apricot, honeysuckle and tropical fruit lead the nose. The round, medium-bodied palate offers creamy white peach, green apple, tangerine and a hint of honeydew melon. Fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors.",Italy-Lombardy-Turbiana
"Earthy compost and minty herb mark this wine's entry and midpalate. Like most of the producer's other wines, this is made using native fermentation and left unfined and unfiltered. Ripe, sinewy tannins cradle deeper, richer tastes of licorice and blackberry.",US-California-Syrah
A ripe and rounded wine with a touch of oygenation to give extra complexity and ripe fruit. Flavors are of pineapple and peach as well as a good citric content. Elegant and fresh as well as rich.,France-Champagne-Chardonnay

"Extended time in the bottle, as well as 18 months in French oak, lend gravitas and elegance to this Cabernet Sauvignon. Hints of maturity—whiffs of truffle and wet soil—lend delightful complexity to sweet-tart black currant and cherry flavors. The finish is bristling and bright, lingering long on a puckering cranberry tone.",US-New York-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Beef jerky and smoked bacon come to mind and are followed by mellow tones of black cherry, ripe fruit and old spice. There's a sophisticated edge to this wine that helps it taste older than it actually is. It imparts flavors of sour cherry and tobacco leaf in the mouth.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Nearly equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this dusty red also makes use of 26% Syrah, 3% Cabernet Sauvignon and 3% unidentified as other. A straightforward wine, it's juicy in blackberry and chalky chocolate.",US-California-Red Blend
"Crisp grapefruit and celery aromas set up a round palate with a pulpy texture. Flavors of scallion, citrus peel and grape skins finish citrusy on one hand and pyrazinic on the other. Possibly of interest, this was fermented and aged in egg-shaped concrete tanks.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Sauvignon Blanc
"Although plummy fruit dominates the nose, if you take an extra moment or two you can ferret out a lot more: mint, leather and vanilla, for example. The flavors feature a wintergreen component that adds a welcome degree of individuality to this offering, before fading into a medium-length finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Malbec offers vanilla, herb and cherry aromas that seem a bit coarse. The palate is full of baking spice flavors—notably vanilla. It's heavy on the oak notes, despite having aged in just 42% new French barrels, the rest older French and American.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Morellino di Scansano is an up-and-coming red wine from Southern Tuscany that is easy and fun to drink. This ruby-colored expression delivers fresh tones of cherry and red currants and it has a soothing, soft texture in the mouth thanks to one year of oak aging.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"With that extra concentration that comes from low-yielding old vines, this has great depth of flavor. It has an apple flavor and crisp, citrusy acidity as well as a more toasty character. Complex and certainly ageworthy, this should keep for at least five years.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This blend of five varieties, including Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel, is soft and sweet. Call it bistro style. It's jammy in cherries, licorice and mocha. Proceeds from the wine's sales go to heart disease research.",US-California-Red Blend
"The freshness and concentration of the fruit flavors in this full-bodied wine is exceptional. It smells like Concord juice and tastes dark and grapy, forming a simple but appealing personality that's hard to resist.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Tightly wound in oak and smoky forest floor, this intriguing wine walks a tightrope between savory characteristics and power that somewhat over take the fruit.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Initial bready aromas settle on sweet apple. In the mouth, this has a confected feel balanced by acidity. Flavors run short and candied, with accents of peach and lychee, while a melony, sugary tasting finish is saved by lasting acidity.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Burnt caramel, vanilla and herbaceous dill notes lend an oaky feel to the dainty red-plum and violet flavors. The tannins are finely grained but persistent, extending the long, sour-cherry-flavored finish.",Germany-Baden-Spätburgunder

"While honeyed peach and quince flavors are juicy and sweet on this delicately framed auslese, distinctly earthy notes of herb and smoke lend a mysteriously savory tone. It bristles on the palate, with sunny lemon acidity.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"This Merlot currently offers a dry palate and firm tannins. As it warms in the glass, subtle blackberry, cola and pepper notes emerge. It's pretty tightly wound for a Merlot, but it's attractively priced and should soften with a little time to breathe.",US-California-Merlot
"From a parcel within the Kirchberg de Barr Grand Cru, this is a structured, serious Gewuztraminer. It has weight as well as sweetness, but it's the potential and ageability that is so impressive. Spice and gingerbread notes, as well as fine acidity, lend complexity to the honeyed, yellow fruits. Drink from 2016.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Hints of earth are the only aromas on the nose, which seems devoid of fruit. The palate has a similar leafy earthiness and slight berry aromas. There are bitter edges on the very slender, soft and easy body. This has a picnic-style rusticity about it and a very clean and dry finish.",France-Alsace-Pinot Noir
"With signs of its wood aging that are balanced with firm tannins and concentrated black fruits, this is a solid wine, packed with tannins. There is a touch of dark chocolate as well as the ripe fruit. It is a fine wine, ready to drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Yeasty and dilute, this is a bit like drinking flat beer. There's little ripeness and no varietal impact.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"This is a spicy, peppery wine initially, opening with a fragrant, fresh and citrus character. It's bright and crisp, showing some intensity from low-yield vines. Full, ripe and fresh on the finish. Screwcap.",Austria-Weinviertel-Grüner Veltliner
"Given the paucity of quality Viognier (or any Viognier) for under $15, this is a notable achievement. Musky, melony and spicy, it marries ample weight and breadth with just enough life-giving acidity. Drink now.",Australia-South Australia-Viognier
"Silky smooth and delicate, this comes from a long-standing family-run winery in the heart of the appellation. It's a subtle, floral wine offering layers of dark plum and strawberry. Medium-weight and tangy in acidity, black tea and toffee notes linger on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Very light and summery on the nose, this bottling shows aromas of yellow melon, green pear, lime blossoms, lime juice and a touch of chalk. Wet rocks, cut garden herbs and green apple skins emerge on the refreshing palate, which is perfect for sunny days and shellfish.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Only disgorged in 2007, this fine vintage wine has preserved all its freshness. There are white fruits, pear juice, a crisp texture. They combine well to create a wine with considerable minerality, flinty, but full in the mouth. Age over the next 4–5 years.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Lots of blackberry, plum, currant and oak flavors in this classic Bordeaux blend. It's so ripe, it's almost sweet, except that the finish is thoroughly dry, with a stimulating scour of tannins and citrusy acids. Right now it's direct and not very complex, leading to the question of ageability. All indications are that it's not a wine you want to cellar, so drink up.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Meant by the producer to be drunk all year (Quat'Saisons means four seasons), this ripe and rounded wine will go as well with a light summer lunch as with turkey at Thanksgiving. The fruit shows gently, warmly and with just the right amount of fresh acidity.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Merlot is initially firm with dry tannins and a powerful structure. This will soften as the bright black-currant flavor from the Cabernet begins to shine. The wine, produced in the southern part of Haut-Médoc, will develop well. Drink from 2021.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Heady aromas of honeysuckle, orange blossom and yellow stone fruit lead the nose on this lightly sparkling dessert wine. The bright palate offers yellow peach, apricot and candied citrus zest alongside a foaming mousse.",Italy-Piedmont-Moscato

"Buttered cherries and grippy cranberry skins mix with a bit of barnyard funk and some sanguine elements on the nose of this clonal study. The palate shows pomegranate, anise seed, black slate, oregano and thyme, though clings mostly to the ripe raspberry and black currant fruit backbone.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"With fruit sourced from some of Barolo's best vineyard crus, this beautiful wine offers fullness, character and longevity. Textbook Nebbiolo aromas include wild berry, blue flower, white pepper, cola and tar. The mouthfeel is spicy, fresh and well structured. Pair this wine with steak au poivre (in 5–10 years or so).",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Concentrated and intense, this wine features a potent whack of oak on the nose, with dark fruit and mocha overtones. There are enough hints of bright, raspberry-tinged fruit to warrant optimism about its aging trajectory, but at the moment it is dark, heavy and slightly scorched. Try after 2017.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"This ripe, smooth wine is juicy with attractive red fruits. A barnyard character at the back spoils the natural fruitiness. Tannins and blackberry flavors provide a happier finish.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
"There's lots to like about this cool-climate Chardonnay, from the ripe pineapple, kiwi and lime flavors to the rich touch of lees and vanilla. It has a sharp cut of acidity that's almost Champagne-like, and calls for extremely rich fare to balance. Try with shrimp risotto.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Soft, savory aromas of smoked meat and pepper typify this poised red from Stellenbosch. The elegant, integrated style marries spicy fruit and minerals in a gentle but ageable package. Food friendly because of its acid balance, the wine will be excellent with everything from duck breast to filet mignon.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Red Blend
"This has acidity and tannins that are rich and complex. The raspberry, cola and licorice flavors have a nice coating of smoky oak.",US-California-Pinot Noir
The wine has plenty of ripe fruit and generous tannins. The blackberry fruitiness and acidity are backed by a dry core that will allow this full-bodied wine to age. Drink from 2018.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Forest floor, black plum, menthol and a whiff of exotic spice unfold on this elegantly structured wine. The precise palate offers mature black cherry, ground pepper, licorice and hint of chewing tobacco framed in firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2019.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This rosato has aromas of wild berry, citrus, almond flower and dried herb. Light and lean, this would pair with barbecued shrimp or fish kebab.",Italy-Tuscany-Rosato
"Supple and sturdy, this beautifully structured blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Syrah, which uses fruit sourced from the estate vineyard, utilizes the best assets of both grapes. The Cabernet gives it both firmness and depth, while the Syrah pipes in vivid, juicy, berry flavors. Still young and primary,  the best is clearly yet to come.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"Vegetal and dull, with asparagus and raspberry flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"You might want to give this bottle a few years of age. Tasted in late October of 2008, it's heavy, with lots of sticky tannins. It's also a bit one-dimensional in red cherry, red currant and red licorice flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Dense in waves of dark chocolate and tar, this balanced, concentrated wine has the requisite elements of dried herb and clove, with a deep plummy finish.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Dense, smoky aromas of well-toasted oak are lactic on impact, with blackberry and cassis scents in support. This is woody, resiny and tannic on the palate, which makes it rough now but bodes well for down the line. Charred, toasty oak and herbal blackberry flavors finish minty, with a speck of creosote. Drink through 2020.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley-Syrah
"Apparently made from Bordeaux varieties, this wine is crisp and overtly sweet. It has simple, jammy flavors of pineapples, lemons and limes.",US-California-White Blend
"If you like your white wines fruity and sweet, this one's for you. It has pretty flavors of peaches, honey and spices.",US-California-Riesling
"This blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Syrah and 17% Petit Verdot retains a reductive quality on the nose even after being opened for quite a while, with slightly funky blackberry and burnt cedar aromas. Dried blackberries and black cherries show on the palate, but the tarry sensation permeates throughout.",US-California-Red Blend
"A bright strawberry-flavored wine, this is fruity and fresh. It has crisp acidity to lift the fruit and a light pepper touch that adds interest and turns it into a fine food-friendly wine. It is ready to drink now.",Portugal-Tejo-Rosé
"Savory notes of chervil combine with fresh citrus and ripe pear on the nose. The plate still has a yeasty, leesy touch and a full texture on the generous but fresh body. Slight spritz adds to the verve. The finish is both warming and refreshing, and chock full of pear fruit.",Austria-Traisental-Grüner Veltliner
"Delicate scents of woodland berry, violet and crushed stone waft out of glass when pouring this mountain Nebbiolo. Luminous and linear, the graceful palate offers tart red cherry, star anise and mineral alongside firm acidity and lithe tannins.",Italy-Lombardy-Nebbiolo
"Candied blueberry and syrupy aromas jump from the glass. The palate, however, is tangy and underdeveloped, with herbal, sharp flavors of boysenberry and black raspberry. Not a lot to the finish other than heat and licorice.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Almost mauve in color, this widely distributed wine (named after the time the winemaking crew pops open their bottles at home) shows candied strawberry, watermelon Jolly Rancher and a touch of slate on the nose. Tons of tongue-tingling acidity and a expertly grippy texture cut through the watermelon and raspberry flavors.",US-California-Rosé
Smoky aromas lead to a wine that is dominated by wood. It is about structure rather than fruit.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
This young wine is so full of fruit. Blackberry and delicious acidity combine with some light tannins to bring out the charm of this fine vintage. Drink from 2018.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The flabby citrus aroma is dusty and shows a tinge of vanilla, which is an aroma that isn't normally associated with Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is big and globby, with an oily note and flavors of citrus, green herb and nettle.",Chile-Maule Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"The 1,800-feet high vineyards perched on scary-steep slopes in the upper Douro give the wine the cool character it needs. Winemaker Francisco Olazabal, a direct descendant of the Douro's Dona Antonia Ferreira, nurtures this unusual white wine (most Douro is red). It's perfumed, fruity and fresh. Acidity, tangy lemon and pineappletake center stage along with a steely inner core. Drink now.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"Banana and lacquer aromas blend with pickled white fruit scents and brine. It's by no means a fresh and inviting Chardonnay; instead, it's a bit mustardy and briney, and not terribly fresh in feel. Is that sauerkraut on the finish?",Chile-Limarí Valley-Chardonnay
"Deep purple fruits, black sage, big cherry and woody spices arise from this wine by Adam Lee, who recently sold to Jackson Family Wines but will remain in charge. The palate shows crushed clove and allspice, licorice, graphite and more dark fruit flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Blackberry, cherry and earthy aromas are backed by a secondary wave of oaky char. This is 80% Garnacha and 20% Carignan with raw clamp to the palate created by grabby tannins and tomatoey acidity. Briny raspberry and plum flavors finish with rubbery tannins and related grab. This is a tough wine but one with lots of life and power. Drink through 2019.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Drawn from a particularly good parcel of old-vine Syrah and bolstered by just 10% Grenache and Carignan, this is an exciting expression of Costières de Nîmes. Aged in 500-liter barrels, the wood component is subtle, adding hints of cedar, vanilla and great textural richness to the wine. Plum, licorice and tree bark notes finish long and velvety. Drink now–2020.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Merlot is heavy on oak. It starts with aromas of toasted oak, coffee and vanilla with just a whiff of black plum. The palate is also dominated by oak extract, chocolate and espresso that muffle the ripe, black fruit gasping beneath the surface. It closes on a bitter note of wood tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Light aromas of almond, fresh-cut red apple and spice lead to restrained fruit flavors. The concentration seems lacking.",US-Washington-Rhône-style White Blend
"Aged in 100% new wood, this massive wine is full of dark plum and fragrant strawberries. It is also packed with dark tannins that give the wine a dry core. The fruitiness has a strongly juicy character, fragrant with acidity and freshness. The end is a reminder that this is a powerful wine. Drink from 2020.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
Softly perfumed stone fruits like ripe mirabelles shimmer in the glass and are supported on the palate with a zingy backbone of freshness. This is a wonderful union of ripe fruit flavors and exhilarating freshness. There is concentration at the core and a long whistle-clean finish.,Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"Noticeable green aromas of juniper bush and grassy berry fruits are reflective of a cool vintage. This feels raw and tight but honest. Flavors of green herbs run side by side with plum and cassis notes. On the finish, oak-driven coffee and chocolate flavors are minty.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Perfumed in a wildness of violet and lavender, this beautiful wine is rich and smooth on the palate, both textured and layered. Seductive in its hint of leathery white pepper, it develops brambly blackberry-compote flavors as it opens in the glass.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This is a light bright wine, full of forward fruitiness. The tangy edge of minerality gives the wine a pleasing texture. Citrus fruits support this texture with their zest and acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a young, firm and seriously tannic wine that will need several years to age. It has structure, a sense of the tough terrain of the upper Douro. Concentrated and dense, it's a wine that will develop; best after 2017.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Aromas of red berry, rose and cake spices lead the way on this ripe, forward Barolo. The round palate offers black cherry, raspberry, licorice and white pepper alongside polished tannins. It's already extremely accessible, so don't leave it in the cellar for too long. Drink 2016–2021.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"MacPhail continues its string of super 2007 vineyard-designated Pinots with this compact, fine young release. It's a bit tight now in acids and tannins, but shows a warm, sweet heart of cherries, raspberries and cola that should emerge with a few years in the cellar. Just beautiful.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine is perfumed, ripe and soft. It shows the richness of the vintage with plenty of warm fruit. Lemon flavors lend a final lift to richer apricot and pear notes. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Though quite different stylistically from the 2009, this is just as good. The structure in 2010 is noteworthy for its high acid focus. There are streaks of berry and cassis, with touches of smoke and espresso. This is a wine to cellar while you are drinking up the delicious 2009.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Bright and spicy, this wine makes an immediate impact. The blueberry fruit has a sassy edge, and it penetrates through the middle into a finish with notes of black licorice, baking spices and coffee grounds. Firm, full and tight, the wine should age nicely now through 2025.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Tropical and citrus notes blend with green herb and subtle struck match notes in this wine. On the palate there's some textural weight and the matchstick character carries through. The searing acidity is overpowering and the wine falls apart a little on the finish, leaving a bitter after taste.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Enticing scents of yellow stone fruit, vanilla, and citrus zest give way to ripe flavors of juicy apricot, candied nectarine, pear and sage. Fresh acidity lifts the rich creamy palate. Made from 99-year-old vines, this shows surprising aging potential. Enjoy through 2021.",Italy-Piedmont-Moscato
"This deeply hued, golden colored wine opens with aromas of orchard fruit, citrus and crushed rock. The linear, vibrant palate tastes of Golden Delicious apple, candied lemon zest and mineral alongside racy acidity that leaves a firm, clean finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Chardonnay
"This is a highly unusual blend of Marsellan and Touriga Nacional, and it smells reduced, lemony and like cola and coffee. The mouthfeel is grating, with sandpaper tannins. Odd, herbal, citrusy notes infiltrate core blueberry flavors, while the finish is hard as nails and tannic to an extreme. Only 200 cases made.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"Underbrush, scorched earth, chopped mint and roasted berry aromas lead the nose. The taut palate offers mature black cherry, clove, dried sage and toasted nut alongside tightly wound tannins that leave a firm finish. Drink 2019–2024.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A serious contender with sophisticated notes of leather, barnyard and cedar wrapped up in toasty vanilla oak. A hint of char adds an edge to a streamlined palate infused with earth, mushroom and strawberry tones. A slight lack of persistence takes it out of the top flight. Fully mature, drink now.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"Ripe blackberry, marzipan and toast aromas amount to a rich, inky and lush bouquet. This is 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot, and it's stout on the palate, with intense acidity and tannins. Dark, oaky blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors end with exotic spice notes and baked, ripe berry and fig flavors. Drink through 2024.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Red Blend
"This is a concentrated, firm and tannic wine. It has a structured feel from Chiroubles, which are the highest vineyards in Beaujolais. With its black fruits, dark tannins and concentrated texture, it could certainly age for 2–3 years, although it is ready to drink now.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This one is a typical, off-dry Vinho Verde with a light prickle and the crispest fruit. The wine is very light, very bright and clean with attractive acidity at the end. Drink now.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White
"Lemon and grapefruit aromas come with minerally notes of granite and crushed vitamin dust. An almost sharp and cutting palate offers generic citrus and green apple flavors in front of a chiseled, high-acid finish.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"This is the first release from this new winery, and was crafted by Jared Etzel using Bonnie Jean and Schindler vineyard fruit. It's a lovely mix of blueberry, raspberry and cherry flavors, lively and bright, with polished acidity and 30% new oak just peeking through. Drink it young with a nice chunk of wild salmon, or age it a few years and bring on the lamb chops. Either way, you're in for a treat.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Although the Chermette family is based among the Beaujolais vineyards to the south, it does also possess vines in the crus villages of the north. With an open, ripe and juicy character the wine has concentration and richness. It is full, fruity and ready to drink.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This is a relatively lightweight Costières de Nîmes, despite being 100% Syrah. Modest cherry and black pepper notes are pretty enough, just lack intensity and fade a bit quickly on the finish.",France-Rhône Valley-Syrah
"Here's a good, rather standard Rhône-style blend that can serve as an everyday house red wine. It's rich in raspberry and cherry fruit, cherry liqueur and sandalwood flavors, and is easy to like.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Consistency in the wine world is a virtue, and Cheval covers the consistency issue with ease. Aromas of earth, mushroom, leather and so forth add an Old World touch to this New World Malbec-Cabernet blend.

Drink now through 2012.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This Bordeaux-style blend offers reserved aromas of cedar, dried herbs and cranberries, vanilla and woodspice. The dark-fruit and spice flavors are retrained and elegant, possessing a sense of balance.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"With 12.9% alcohol, this Riesling is absolutely dry and fascinatingly complex. High acidity frames citrus fruit, green apple and mineral flavors. Should develop in interesting ways over the next six years.",US-California-Riesling
This is an aromatic wine with generous fruit and soft tannins. Its wood aging has given the wine extra richness as well as spice. The wine is ready to drink.,Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese Red
"With some richness, red fruits over wood and a full-bodied structure, this is a solid, dense wine. Acidity is present, while the ripe juicy fruits more than balance it. The tannins offer a firm structure and suggest aging.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Everything about this wine screams for aging. It's tight in acids and tannins, and the fruitiness tastes young and jammy with waves of raspberries, cherries, red currants and mocha. By turns, it's sweet and bitter, but always succulent, and with a finish so long and spicy, it persists after a full minute. Cellar until 2017, and it should provide beautiful drinking for many more years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This full-bodied wine has a strong stamp of sweet-seeming oak in the aroma and flavor, dominating its lighter raspberry and red cherry notes. Vanilla and brown sugar nuances emerge and continue into the finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Truffle, fig, underbrush, toast and chopped mint aromas emerge in the glass along with a whiff of cocoa. The firm palate shows dried black cherry, cinnamon, clove and star anise alongside assertive tannins that need to unwind. Drink 2018–2024.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Colvecchio is Castello Banfi's Syrah, which delivers layers of blueberry, cherry, leather, bacon, spicy herbs and liquid smoke. Its firm structure and fragrant intensity set it above the crowd.",Italy-Tuscany-Syrah
"The cold, uneven vintage gives this rosé a green, New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc-style gooseberry aroma and flavor that makes it odd. There are some good watermelon and strawberry flavors, but it tastes unripe.",US-California-Rosé
"Richly structured, this wine is dense and solid. It has swathes of ripe fruit, bold tannins and an impressive firm character. Its future is assured with its dense texture, black fruit and acidity all coming into place. Drink from 2021.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The nose is rather shy but eventually shows earthy aromas of grilled herb, charcuterie and ground clove. The aromas follow over to the juicy, rather rustic palate along with red cherry and a funky hint of game. It's easy drinking, with loose, somewhat fleeting tannins.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Ripe black cherry and a hint of menthol in both the aromas and the flavors give this brawny wine a unique personality. It has bold fruit, ample tannins for texture and good acidity for balance. This is tasty now but will age well through at least 2023.",US-California-Zinfandel
Unusual hints of mango hint at very ripe fruit. The slender palate counters this aromatic abundance with tenderly fresh notes of lemon zest and wood sorrel. The result is both delicious and refreshing.,Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"Despite good persistence and appealing earth and leather flavors, this Barbaresco fails to hit the mark. Aromas of paint thinner undermine the cherry fruit and flatten out the flavors in the mouth.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A great followup to the '08, which was one of the best Gewürztraminers of the vintage. The '09 is even better, with a crisp, minerally mouthfeel, and superrich flavors of tropical fruits, spices and honeysuckle flowers. No oak, no malolactic and just a slight touch of sweetness on the finish.",US-California-Gewürztraminer
"While it's dry and acidic, it has a coarseness that's unforgiving.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Quite lightly aromatic, it offers hints of barrel spice, cocoa, herbs and red fruit. The palate has coffee ice cream and vanilla flavors with a compact yet elegant feel, showing some grit to the tannins.",US-Oregon-Syrah
"This patiently aged wine boasts an amazing nose of dried olallieberry fruit leather, chocolate-cherry sauce, vanilla extract and exotic black spices, showing its years in only the best ways. It's surprisingly lean on the palate at first, then evolves into red cherries and plums, with well-integrated dried oregano and black pepper spices.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Brooding smoke, purple fruit and violet aromas are followed by sumptuous fruit and barrel flavors in this Syrah. Barrel notes linger on the finish, feeling a bit raw but not detracting from the overall enjoyment.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This structured, firm wine brings out tannins as well as rich fruits. Concentrated raspberry and ripe cherry flavors are cut with a fine balance of acidity. From a single vineyard, the wine needs some age, so drink from 2017.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Tightly wound, layered, moderately tannic and oozing excellence, this is a fantastic high-end Toro from the superb 2012 vintage. The minerally, toasty aroma of blackberry is stylish and shows a balsamic note. Flavors of licorice, sweet balsamic vinegar, chocolate and toasty blackberry continue on a long, deep, complex finish. Drink this ace-level red from 2017–2028.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro
"A fruity wine with soft tannins that is ready to drink. It has banana, red cherry and light spice flavors, finished off with attractive acidity.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
Spicy grassy aromas of catmint are matched by unusual clove scents. A tough rubbery palate is where you'll find spicy blackberry and green-herb flavors. Pulling tannins are the driving force on this wine's choppy clipped finish.,Chile-Maipo Valley-Syrah
"Chaparral scrub and hibiscus combine on the rather light and dainty nose. Iron, tart cranberry and riper pomegranate pop on the palate, which has good energy and is fairly straightforward and simple.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This outstanding Malbec dazzles with scents of tobacco and chocolate, flavors of sour cherry and plum, and impressive concentration and persistence. The flavors gather strength and focus, adding details of lavender and lemon curd, as they roll into a lingering finish.",US-Oregon-Malbec
"It's easy to like this affordable Moscato. It's low in alcohol, high in sweetness and brisk with acidity, along with intense flavors of oranges and vanilla honey.",US-California-Moscato
"A bit difficult to approach now, this has tight tannins that lock down the wine with astringency. Blended with a little Petit Verdot and Malbec, it slowly reveals massive layers of blackberries, cassis liqueur and dark chocolate, remaining stubbornly tight throughout. Many people will drink it soon with beef, and that's fine, especially with a good decant, but it should reward even more with 8–10 years in a proper cellar.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This warm-vintage wine strikes a perfect mix of restraint and intensity, with its abundant notes of peach and pear. It's lightly creamy in feel, with deft fruit flavors that show an exquisite sense of balance throughout.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"With firm tannins as well as juicy black-currants, this is an attractive wine. It has plenty of acidity which is balanced by the ripe fruitiness. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A closed, tight and grippy wine, this has a big tannic structure that supports a landscape of cassis, cranberry and ripe plum, along with clove and tobacco. Fuller-bodied in style, it finishes smooth and lean.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Not a successful wine. It's unripe, with asparagus aromas and flavors dominating the cherries.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"With fruit from the Hames Valley AVA, this Morgan Hill-based winery delivers distinct aromas of pomegranate-glazed mushrooms and red pepper spice. Cracked black pepper and a hint of green herbs carries the palate, which holds a bittersweet cranberry note through the finish.",US-California-Merlot
"This wine by winemaker Fintan du Fresne shows sea salt, apple blossom, cherimoya and tangerine rinds on the nose. Flavors are clean and pure, with dried apple, more sea salt, a bit of nectarine and orange spritz, offering a profile that could comfortably rest on the tongue all day long.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The aromas pop, with notes of diesel, lychee, dried orange peel, marmalade and peach. The stone-fruit and tropical flavors are rich, sugary and intense, showing an exquisite sense of balance. Skip the rest of dessert. This delivers it all by itself.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Fresh berry-salad aromas suggest tart, just-ripe summer fruits in this medium-bodied Shiraz filled with crunchy fruit. It's forward and smashable in the best sense, even if it's not profound.",Australia-New South Wales-Shiraz
Aromas of blackberry jam and boysenberry lead to a ripe full-bodied palate. It brings a sense of hedonism.,US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Very dark in color, this is an impressive wine with power and dense tannins. The fruit is solid, packed with blackberry and dark plum flavors, and wild, almost savage, ripeness.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"The aromas are generous, with notes of spice box, blue and purple fruit, pencil lead, barrel spice and vanilla. It's silky and sumptuous, showing a pleasing sense of texture and an extended finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This mature blend of Gewurztraminer, Sauvignon Blanc and Macabeo is oily, plump and fragrant, but also blocky, chunky and on its last legs of freshness. Flowery peach, melon and papaya flavors end short, with an oily mouthfeel.",Spain-Northern Spain-White Blend
"Cherry-scented, clean and fruity. Good concentration mid-palate, with no discernable new oak, just a balanced, firm attack and a strong, chewy finish. Only 123 cases made.",US-California-Zinfandel
"The nose of this bottling is all about bright citrus and yellow flower, with upfront aromas suggesting crushed white rocks, grapefruit pith and sweet grass. It's supercrisp, grippy and sharp in acidity on the palate, showing white flower and clover honey flavors as it opens.",US-California-Riesling
"This medium-bodied red offers aromas of stewed black-skinned fruit, pressed blue flower, menthol and clove. On the forward, chewy palate, notes of licorice and ground pepper accent a black cherry core while fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2019.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A fifty-fifty blend of native grapes Cesanese di Affile and Cesanese Comune, this savory, medium-bodied charmer offers juicy black currant, blackberry, white pepper and intriguing charred notes. It's well balanced with fresh acidty and lithe tannis that offer easy-drinking pleasure.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"Complex, flavorful but not too big, this layered wine has aromas like cedar and tobacco, and flavors like black cherry and mint. It offers a medium-full body and velvety texture.",US-California-Red Blend
"Strong, rich and extracted fruits are concentrated around a firm tannic core. The wine does have fruit, black currants and dark plums that give a more juicy side. Drink this still-young wine from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Bright and refreshing acidity is the star of this lovely, windswept wine, powerful yet integrated in tannin and oak. The racy, feral notes of anise, apple blossom and nutmeg are complemented by a teasingly voluptuous spirit that never overwhelms.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Layered botrytis that gives the wine both its richness and dense texture. It is sweet but with a dry core and crisp acidity, it will age well. It is going to be a beautiful wine, with tropical fruits, apricots and wonderful final acidity. Drink from 2025.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Here's a ripe, complex white wine with aromas and flavors ranging from tangerines, apricots and bananas to malted chocolate milk. It tastes very ripe and fruity, with a soft, creamy mouthfeel like peach syrup. There might be just a tad of residual sugar in there, but it's basically a dry wine.",US-California-Marsanne
"This Ripasso delivers very nice fullness and intensity with well-integrated aromas of black fruit, suede, spice, nut, cola and leather. It's soft and velvety with a clean, slightly fresh menthol close.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Baked blackberry, vanilla, dust and chocolate show on the nose of this blend of 69% Petite Sirah, 22% Grenache and 9% Tannat. The palate is ripe with plum, blueberry and black currant and lifted by dried ginger and nutmeg, but the dazzling acidity and tannic firmness is what takes it to the next level.",US-California-Red Blend
"Apple and pine aromas are attractive. This wine feels round, with just enough citrusy acidity to offset an oily quality. Generous citrus, melon and stone-fruit flavors finish clean and solid.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"This Ferreirinha Douro Superior wine is made in exceptional years. The 2007 is the 16th vintage since 1960 (the previous release was 2003). It is an immense wine in its grandeur while being sophisticated and structured. There are complex flavors from the long wood aging. The dark, dense black fruits are impressive while perfectly meshed into the concentrated tannins and black currant acidity. This wine, even at nine years, is young, and should not be drunk before 2020 (or decanted if you can't wait).",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"From the Orcia area of Tuscany, here's a blockbuster 70-30 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot with deep concentration and thick density. Evident woodshop or carpentry tones come into play, leaving long-lasting flavaors of vanilla bean, chocolate and coffee. The wine has tart, plump tannins that need a few more years of bottle aging before they settle into place. Drink after 2015.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Despite the low alcohol reading, this comes across as dry rather than off dry. Apple, pear and white peach anchor a just-ripe-enough wine with highlights of citrus oil. There's good length and focus throughout.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Sea spray and salty mineral complexities accent luscious, peachy fruit from nose to finish in this delightfully complex Riesling. It's weightier and more expansive on the palate than a typical Kabinett, but spine-tingling tangerine and lemon acidity lend a fresh, persistent finish. Ready to drink now but should improve through at least 2021.",Germany-Rheinhessen-Riesling
"Lots of ripe, sweet blackberry, raspberry and cherry fruit flavors in this soft, tannic Bordeaux blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon. It's dry, but high alcohol glycerine, combined with the fruity extract, make it taste almost like Port. Drink now.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Overly sharp acidity marks this wine, giving it a cutting mouthfeel that interferes with otherwise delicious flavors. It sure is deep and long in blackberries, black currants, black licorice and smoky cedar wood, and the tannins are thick and dry, suggesting ageability.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The aromas in this juicy Dolcetto suggest black cherry, violet and toasted almond while the palate offers ripe blackberry, white pepper and clove flavors. Rounded tannins provide support. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto
"Fluffy, almost cloud-like in mouthfeel, this finely textured late-release Riesling already shows clues of just a few years of bottle-age magic. Savory notes of white mushroom and spice lend umami to slicks of sweet marmalade, grapefruit and honey. It's an enticing wine at a surprisingly gentle price.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Distinctive elements on the nose of this wine from the Buellton-based winery include dried peach, lemon ice and a touch of yogurt and sour cream. There is a dairy tang to the palate and only the slightest touch of green, with aged lemon peels, sour nectarine and tart plum-flesh flavors.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Thick, tannic and somewhat astringent, this wine blends 80% Cabernet Sauvignon with 10% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petite Sirah. Tar and tobacco flavors and a leathery mouthfeel give it a loud voice of powerful ripeness.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"88-90 Barrel sample. Caramel new wood aromas are followed by spice and toast flavors. The fruit seems thin by comparison, hard to feel under all that polished toast.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A round and smooth version of Albariño, with apricot and orange aromas. The palate has a layered, creamy feel and full flavors of bulky apricot, peach and also citrus. Fleshy on the finish, and definitely at peak maturity. Drink right away.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"A little prickly and sharp on the nose, with cherry, raspberry and piney aromas.

"This is a cuddly, jammy, ripe Malbec with maple, blackberry and oak aromas. It feels weighty and lush, with large-scale boysenberry, blackberry and blueberry flavors.

"A firm, structured blend of 50-50 Pinot Noir and Touriga Nacional, this wine is rich and made to age. A dense texture underlies the ripe blackberry fruits and firm tannins. Aged for 18 months in wood, the wine needs time to mature further. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese Red

"This 100% varietal wine is one of the best Viognier buys in California. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with slightly oaky notes accenting ripe flavors of peaches, limes, apricots and honeydew. This would be a good buy at twice the price.",US-California-Viognier

"Earthy aromas lead to a wine that is at a stage of development that suppresses fruit. The wood aging and the extracted structure are still strong. Hints of juicy black fruits emerge, promising a good, if tannic future. Wait until 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Smells oily, with a diesel-fuel note that some may find offputting. Rich and earthy on the palate, this bottling emphasizes spice, mineral and loam flavors, not the bright fruit of so many other Ontario products.",Canada-Ontario-Riesling
"The small 2015 vintage didn't give John Benedetti much to work with, but he sources 60% from Bald Mountain Vineyard in Bonny Doon and 40% from Split Rail in Corralitos to deliver this stunner. Aromas of Marcona almond, buttered croissant and lemon preserves lead into a palate full of acidic energy. Salty, savory flavors of roasted nuts meet with warm buttercream and fresh lemon spray on the palate. It provides a full experience.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Spicy, slightly resinous with notes of leaf, clove and licorice that complement good dark cassis fruit. Some coffee and smoke enter into the middle and finish, though the flavors fall away rather quickly. It's well balanced and a pleasure to drink, but not built for cellaring.",US-Washington-Red Blend

"Harvested in November 2011 from botrytized grapes which have benefited from the autumn mists, the wine is a fine combination of intense acidity and superrich honeyed flavors.

"Tropical fruit and melon aromas are filled out with a touch of toast and acidity. The result is a wine that is not quite balanced, with wood and fruit still at odds. The aftertaste, with a creamy texture, is more attractive. This is one of the first vintages since Labouré-Roi, which was hit by scandal in 2012, passed into new ownership.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This is oakier and more expensive than prior Trapiche Chardonnays, but it's not necessarily better. It smells like a rubber band and a barrel, bearing resiny flavors of mango and melon, with lots of sweet oak and vanilla tones.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"Bright and fresh, this is a totally fruity wine with a more serious edge at the end. Red cherries push through the crisp acidity that offers a zingy texture. The touch of minerality in the 40-year-old vines from the Chapoly vineyard granite soil gives an austere, structured aftertaste.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Dry and thin, with diluted cherry flavors. Oak fortunately adds needed vanilla and smoky char richness. The lack of fruity concentration accentuates the alcohol and acidity. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"There are delicious flavors in this ripe Syrah, and while it's too soft for comfort, it sure is nice to drink. Offers waves of blackberries, mocha, black pepper and smoky sandalwood that finish thoroughly dry and complex in Asian spices.",US-California-Syrah
"This is a Bordeaux blend, based on Merlot, with some Petite Sirah mixed in. It's very dry, quite full-bodied and a little rustic, with some tough, edgy tannins. Doesn't seem like an ager, but it will benefit from a few hours in a decanter.",US-California-Red Blend
"With loads of oak, pineapple and orange honey flavors, this sweet Chardonnay will appeal to those who like this heavy, over-the-top style.",US-California-Chardonnay
"One of the best Stoller Vineyard designates from anywhere, this bright and spicy effort is bursting with flavors of red currants, accented with smoky chocolate. Tannins are fine tuned and the wine has excellent balance throughout.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
Here's a thickly extracted and dense interpretation of Barbera lavished over with intense secondary aromas of oaky spice and toasted wood. There's a lot of wood here that is offputting at first but that will hopefully find harmony with more years in the bottle.,Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"If the label is to be believed, this pure Merlot, from a relatively cool site in a relatively cool year, tops 16% alcohol. The flavors reflect that; a thick mix of tar, smoke, asphalt, espresso and coffee grounds. Buried in there is some black cherry fruit, but it is definitely the barrel flavors and the alcohol that dominate.",US-Washington-Merlot
Sweet tones of peach and nectarine are backed by honey and yellow rose. The sweetness in this dry expression from the Cartizze cru is very evident and the wine does a nice job of showing creamy effervescence to render more volume and richness on the finish.,Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Full, soft and rich, this has flavors of ripe yellow fruit and red apple, with a textured edge. The wine is round and layered with delicious acidity. While its already to drink now, it will age for 3–4 years.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A very nice Merlot whose pure cherry, red currant and cedar flavors are supported by rich, sturdy tannins. The finish is spicy and long. Great partner with steaks and chops, and the price is right.",US-California-Merlot
"A muskiness is present on the nose of this wine from Santa Barbara County's first commercial vineyard, along with fruitier aspects of strawberry-boysenberry tart. It's fruit-forward on the palate, yet cinnamon toast and cedar give it a more serious edge as well.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"An intense perfume of tropical fruit, flowers and spice extends from nose to finish throughout this extravagant, yet small-footed Riesling. The palate is touched with honey and a bristling lemon-lime acidity that adds elegance and brace.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"This is a bold, meaty wine with thick aromas of smoke, cured meat, mesquite wood, ripe blueberry and sweet cherry. It makes a grand impression on both the nose and the tongue because of its exceptional density, its supple texture and its impressive length.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"92-94. Barrel sample. A smooth and rich wine that also shows depth of flavor. Wrapped in its tight texture are notes of peach and mango, bitter orange and lemon zest. It's a fine wine that should age for many years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Packed with juicy berry flavors, this outgoing wine blends great freshness and pure grape flavors with a lip-smacking texture of tannins and acidity that keep it well balanced. It resembles black berry, raspberry and boysenberry juices, has a tangy mouthfeel and lingering, tingly finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Unlike the Colheita version, this can sustain high alcohol easily. That's because the black fruit is rich enough, there is a fine freshness from juicy acidity and the tannins are well managed. This is a wine to age and drink from 2017.",Portugal-Dão-Portuguese Red
"For an amazing price you get a dry, silky and elegant Pinot, with deeply satisfying flavors of raspberry, red currant and pomegranate. Thankfully, this should be easy to find, with nearly 17,000 cases produced.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A very herbal wine, it's also light and fruity. With crisp gooseberry, currants and an attractive perfumed fruitiness, it needs to develop for a few months. Wait until the end of 2014.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Apple and pear aromas are clean as a whistle. This is varietal Xarello, a key grape in Cava production. It is citrusy and minerally in feel, with lemon, tangerine and stony flavors mixed with a touch of yeast. A tight, exact finish is juicy and stony.",Spain-Catalonia-Xarel-lo
"Apple and nectarine aromas are clean and snappy, with a hint of yeast-based vanilla. A fresh, citric palate delivers lime, green apple, pineapple and nectarine flavors, while the finish is clean as a new razor, with nothing off, bitter or pithy.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"Here's an easy-going Salice Salentino (90% Negroamaro and 10% Malvasia Nera) with spice, cherry and cola notes that are weaved nicely together. There's harmony and elegance here and the wine leaves a spicy imprint on the close.",Italy-Southern Italy-Red Blend
"Unconvincing aromas are hard to describe. This Malbec sparkler is coarse and foamy on the palate, with burnt peppery slightly bitter flavors of orange and grapefruit.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Sparkling Blend
"When a young Pinot Noir is dominated by oak, as this one is, it's a little worrying. Will the oak be absorbed in time, or will it always be excessive? This young wine has pleasant cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors, but the oak seems to have the upper hand. Drink soon.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of oak, coffee, rose, chopped mint and licorice take shape in the glass while the tight palate offers toast, espresso, raspberry jam and a confectionary note. Firm tannins grip the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Dark in color, this wine offers a meaty, gamy quality around sizable, still-puckering tannins and oak. Despite its size and grippiness, it traffics in violet and herb, with a dry finish piqued in tobacco. Drink now through 2018.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Take a walk on the wild side with this Rhône-style red. The meaty, spicy, earthy aromas lead to enjoyable fruit, spice and mocha flavors that rest on a firm bed of fine tannins and good acidity.",US-California-Red Blend
"Minty aromas go along with firm, barely bitter tannins. They dominate the wine, smothering the fruit and lending a burnt quality to the palate.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This 100% Merlot has high-toned aromas of worn leather and undergrowth, dark cherry and exotic spices, which lead onto the lithe, medium-bodied palate. Fine, chalky tannins and bright acids give this wine some footing, and the subtle finish comes with an herbal edge.",US-Virginia-Red Blend
"Smoke, yeast, earth and peppery herbs unite to make an almost archetypal Grüner. The palate has the same savory core but also introduces green and yellow pear to create a very harmonious, textured palate that just sings with spice and pepper.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"Fruity, silky and simple, with jammy flavors of raspberries and red cherries, tobacco and spice. Feels light and pleasant in the mouth, but could use more stuffing.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Aged partly in concrete vats and partly in oak, this shows concentrated sensations of ripe plum, sour cherry and raspberry layered with espresso notes. Pair this with grilled vegetables or spicy cheeses.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This wine is tightly textured, firm and with a strongly tannic element. It will be better with food.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"Yeasty aromas are devoid of fruit, commitment and minerality, and instead smell oddly floral and unconvincing. A waxy, wan palate and oaky flavors of clove finish with resiny, pushy spice notes. This tastes overly oaky and resiny, like the winery's Rioja white called La Capellanía but without the goods.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Vibrant aromas of pineapple, kiwi and gummy bear lead to just off-dry drinking flavors. The concentration seems a bit lacking.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"One word describes this Chardonnay: fabulous. It's really everything a California Chardonnay can deliver. Ripe tropical fruit, pear, green apple and honey flavors are wrapped into buttery, smoky oak. The richness is brightened by crisp acidity and a touch of minerals, showing its pedigree with every nuance. Drink soon, to enjoy its youthful beauty.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Creamy apple, lemon shortbread and fresh citrus make for a convincing trio of aromas. They continue their merry dance on the generous, dry and poised palate to achieve real elegance. All the while there is a deeper, hidden core that draws you in, speaking of stone and honeycomb. With its tiny, pin-prick bubbles this is utterly charming and grown-up, harmonious and poised.",England-England-Sparkling Blend
"Grapefruit, lemon and star anise aromas lead this refined but friendly wine. On the palate, lush, rounded flavors of melon and tropical fruit are supported by brisk acidity. Great combination with richer poultry or pork dishes.",Greece-Santorini-Assyrtico
"Dry oak, black fruit and floral notes suggestive of violet are the aromas that set off this tannic, clamping, deeply structured Malbec. Flavors of mocha, maple, savory blackberry and roasted plum end with a mix of creaminess and strapping tannins. Drink through 2025.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"With 50% new oak aging, the wood stands out now, showing caramelized and buttered toast flavors. Under that is a dry, tannic wine, filled with raspberries, cherries and spicy pomegranates. Complex and pedigreed, it wants some time in the cellar. Better after 2014.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The fragrance is almost otherworldly; sweet, dense and lightly lifted. This is a sinewy wine, that begins with compact power and focused, tart red fruits—predominantly raspberry and currant. At first juicy and tart, with hours of breathing time the wine broadens out into a wider spectrum of Cabernet fruits; cassis, blackberry and black cherry.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"With just 8% Syrah in the blend, this is a fine example of the distinctive flavors found in the best Washington state Mourvèdre. The vines are still young, the raspberry/blackberry fruit flavors bright, focused and forward, but the penetrating minerality of the grape and the region is also in evidence. The Syrah brings a hint of pepper into play in the finish.",US-Washington-Mourvèdre
"Raisiny and earthy on the nose, this Bonarda also offers damp aromas of fern and tobacco. Chunky, with a soft, flat palate, this tastes raisiny and stewed. Low acidity and raisiny flavors on the finish are consistent with what came before.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Bonarda
"This reserve-level wine is a barrel selection from a particular block of the vineyard. It's aromatic, with wet hay, raspberry and cherry scents. The flavors have a lightly spicy lift, punching through with a chipotle pepper-like edge but finishing on ripe fruit. Best through 2022.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Herbal berry aromas include a heavy dose of spent coffee grinds and oak. This has an edgy, hard mouthfeel and oaky flavors of plastic and vanilla that sit on top of herbal berry notes. A creamy finish maintains the wine's oaky theme.",Chile-Central Valley-Carmenère
"This new label by a few friends who are veterans of the restaurant business is promising. This bottling shows peach, lime rind and melted butter on sliced apple on the open and inviting nose. Anjou pear, dried apple and jasmine flowers show on the palate, which is tropical in nature but not overly showy.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a rich wine made to be drunk young. It has spice, a smoky-bacon flavor and warm-hearted red plum and damson fruitiness. The wood aging shows through in hints of toast. The wine is ready now.",France-Southwest France-Red Blend

"Perfumed, fresh, attractive wine. It feels light in character, the texture open, showing jelly fruit character as well as ripe fruit. There is a perfumed rosehip aftertaste.",Portugal-Port-Port
"A zesty wine with more zap and tang than one might expect. That said, it's solid as a rock, with intense flavors of cherry, plum, carob and oak. Call it a bit obtuse, if you will. But even with woody finishing notes of vanilla and cream, this settles on fruit more so than the barrel. Carmenère (78%) with Syrah and Carignan.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley-Red Blend
"Tight fruit aromas of cassis, cranberry and wild berry give this wine a bright and crisp first impression. The acidity is sharp, lively and definitely cuts straight across the palate. There's medium body here to hold up all that freshness.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Proprietor Maurizio Fuselli's 100% Syrah from coastal Tuscany—his debut vintage—could not be more encouraging. The wine exhibits pure berry fruit: Blackberry and cherry is backed by leather, spice and cigar box. The wine has tight, solid tannins, good length and a long, cherry-driven finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Syrah

"Solid tannins still dominate this potentially ripe and full-bodied wine. It has the richness and structure of the vintage, giving ripe red fruits from the Merlot as well as tight tannins that need to soften. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This spent 18 months in French oak and three years in bottle, ahead of an April 2016 release. Light and elegant, it carries a whiff and taste of leather, with earthy, slightly grainy tannins. With air, the strawberry fruit gains some flesh. Decant it and drink now through 2018.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Herbal peppercorn cradles a soft composition with an oaky, structured backbone to this wine comprised of 47% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc. Medium bodied, the cranberry, tobacco and plum play on the palate through a lengthy finish.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Intriguing with bites of melon, stone fruit and bristling acidity, this bright, fresh white wine maintains a level of tension and creaminess. It balances the two personalities against each other with aplomb, before losing some of its luster on the finish.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine takes time to unravel and reveal itself, rewarding the patient with a wealth of high-toned citrus and elegantly wound, medium-bodied honeyed pear and caramel. Lengthy and complex, it's one to consider aging and allowing to further mellow over time. Drink now through 2021.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This bottling from John Sebastiano Vineyard is a great example of how a light Grenache can entertain needy palates. Sagebrush-laced aromas of wild thyme and tree bark mesh with tart pomegranate, red currant and a touch of red-cherry pie on the nose. The tea-leaf-laced sip shows raspberry, red plum and red apple, which just enough tannic structure.",US-California-Grenache

"Awesome. A superior California Syrah, one of the finest of the vintage. Although it's dry, it's massive in blackberry and blueberry pie filling fruit, with interesting complexities of smoked meats, black pepper, minerals from the earth, cola and sandalwood. Just delicious now, and should hold in the bottle over the next six years.",US-California-Syrah
"A first-release from this winery founded by Napa Valley's Dennis Cakebread, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc from Seven Hills Vineyard shows notes of tomato leaf, chocolate, cherry and vanilla.

Fruit flavors are focused and soft, with the oak giving the tannins a slightly astringent feel.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Vaulorent is often grouped with others as Fourchaume Premier Cru. Here Brocard has bottled it separately to bring out its ripe fruits and warm character.

"Made in méthode champenoise style from Chardonnay grapes, this offers an entirely appropriate simplicity of lemon-lime citrus and green apple, with balanced acidity. It finishes slightly sweet.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Foxy cherry and cough drop aromas are not convincing. Feels astringent and tastes tart, with sharp but candied cherry, faux oak and milk chocolate flavors. Blends sour notes with sweet oak, all to little avail.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A powerful, wood-aged rosé that shows great richness, density and structure. Treat this as a fine wine and you'll appreciate the texture, the mature berry fruits, the spice and vanilla flavors. Weighty and full in the mouth, this could even age well for another year or two.",France-Provence-Rosé

"Beefy, stocky aromas also bring herb, tomato and berry notes. The palate is jumpy and slightly medicinal, with currant, tomato, herb and plum flavors running the show. Medium in size, with level tannins and a juicy, good overall feel to it.",Spain-Northern Spain-Mencía
"A ripe blend of Touriga Nacional and Castelão, the wine is balanced with considerable acidity from the Castelão and structure from the Touriga. It is only just beginning to mature while red berry and red currant fruit flavors still shine out. Drink now and until 2020.",Portugal-Bairrada-Portuguese Red
"This wine tastes concentrated and powerful, from the first whiff of spicy cedar and black pepper to the smoky, dried fruit flavors and mouth-coating texture. It owes its savory, smoky character to its exceptionally long 30-month oak ageing. Yet while bold and assertive, its alcohol is restrained.",US-California-Malbec
"Wonderful notions of ivy leaves, citrus peel and conifer greet the nose. The aromatic impression leads onto a slender, dry and fluid palate that still seems tightly coiled and closed. But those subtle aromatic hints and a concentrated, stony palate promise future pleasure. This will blossom into a perfumed marvel. Drink 2019–2030.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Floral and clean on the nose, with good red fruit and cherry flavors. By no means is this a fat-styled, extracted Malbec. Instead it's fresh and crisp, but tasty and pretty well balanced, especially if there's some food along for the ride. Imported by USA Wine Imports.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This is Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills fruit, delicately managed, so as not to overwhelm the fruit. The strawberry/raspberry sweetness is there, and a wash of molasses carries it into a smooth, luscious finish. The wine is not complex—just very tasty.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Green notes lead the parade here: Grass, peas and tomato leaf march ahead of the lemon citrus notes, with an intriguing struck-match character taking up the rear. On the palate, the acidity is prominent but in check, and the slightly chalky texture is appealing. When it comes to flavor, however, it loses much of what the nose offers, finishing a little flat and bitter.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc

"A spectacular Pinot, continuing a string of great vintages from this little vineyard. The year 2007 gave California supernaturally rich but balanced Pinot Noirs, and this is one of them.

Truly fine, this small-production wine should age over the next 6–8 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"This structured, dense and smoky wine features dry tannins and a mineral texture. It has blackberry fruitiness to go with this scaffolding, so it will develop well to give a ripe, full, rich wine. Wait until 2015.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"There's a lot of unripeness going on here, showing up as lean, tobaccoey flavors verging on mint. Drinks acidic and thin, and while there are some black cherry flavors, the wine is basically herbal. Yet it's not without its charms.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This Zinfandel's tannins are starting to resolve, which gives the palate a soft, melted quality. The primary flavors are transforming into rich, dried black-raspberry and cherry notes, with leather, mocha, dried mushroom and spice accents.",US-California-Zinfandel

"Produced from vines up to 80 years old, this is a powerful, wood-aged wine. Tannins are mixed with toast, spice and dark plum flavors. Acidity gives freshness and finishes the wine with very fine fruits as well as structure. Age this impressive wine and drink from 2018.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Ripe fruit in the mouth, with a fine layer of green plums, apricots and balancing acidity. An open wine, generous in texture and weight, ready to drink in the next few months.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Packaged in a cute yellow recyclable Tetrapak, this easy Chard is sweet in pineapple juice and green apple flavors, balanced with crisp acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a recent acquisition by the owners of neighboring Château Bouscaut, a separate estate and not a second wine. It has a very forward, herbaceous character, all grapefruit and sweet lemons. There is a pear and apple skin texture which gives a delicious bite to the acidity. Definitely a food wine.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This Malbec is so dry, tannic and acidic that it's impossible to enjoy it on its own. There's a core of blackberries, but wow, what a tough wine. Decant it for a few hours and try it with barbecue.",US-California-Malbec
"This is bone dry, with lots of zesty acidity and flavors of sour cherry candy, pomegranate and persimmon, with a mushroomy earthiness. It should change over the next four years, although not necessarily improving. Try pairing it with steak, lamb or a rich cut of ahi tuna.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"This powerful blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Franc by longtime urban winemaker Benjamin Silver comes together in a big way.

The rich palate shows black cherry, black raspberry and a pinch of tarragon.",US-California-Red Blend

"Zenith is the winery's estate vineyard, and represents a particularly fine value in a splendid lineup. The ripe, plummy fruit is swathed in rich brown spices, a sweet streak of molasses, and notes of tobacco and black tea. Decant and enjoy immediately, or cellar for another couple of years to let the flavors continue melding.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"Tannic and dry, it's one tough wine, stinging the gums. But it has plenty of ripe blackberry, coffee, pepper and toasty flavors, and should age well. Hold onto it until 2019.",US-California-Petite Sirah

"Bright raspberry, cherry and rose petal aromas meet cola spice on the pretty, delicate nose of this bottling—a solid example of the surge in quality of Central Coast Grenache. There is a tense tannic structure to the palate despite its light nature, with great acidity presenting tangy red and purple fruit flavors, with more rose petal accents.",US-California-Grenache
"This light-bodied wine has aromas like strawberries and maple syrup, and flavors that taste almost sweet. It makes a tempting, light and airy drink that's good for casual occasions.",US-California-Zinfandel

"Vinified in the soft, opulent style of Chambolle, this is ripe and round. With its dry edge and rich fruit, the structure of the apparent is apparent. The acidity cuts through to give a juicy element. Already delicious to drink, but it's worth aging over 2–3 years.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir

The delicious palate doles out crunchy red cherries, crushed raspberries, mint, anise and minerality alongside fresh acidity and polished tannins. Drink through 2018.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"This has creamy flavors of vanilla, honey, lime and orange.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Tight and nicely constructed, this is not afraid to show its herbal side. Tannins are earthy and firm, the fruit tight and focused, and the wine might benefit from a few more years in the bottle. What's already there is cassis, tar and earth, finishing with a light but balanced fade.",US-Washington-Merlot
"A blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 39% Merlot and 3% each of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, this wine tastes of charred wood and generic red juice, accented by a slight green character. Puckering tannins and a diluted finish complete the picture.",US-California-Meritage
"There's a preponderance of ripeness in this wine, the fruit tasting of baked blackberry and tar.",US-California-Syrah

"Given the great potential of the 2015 vintage, it's reassuring to see that some big brands have scored successes like this. Explosive aromas of lime, tangerine and pink grapefruit burst from the glass, followed by ample citrus flavors. There's a hint of herbaceousness that grounds it in Marlborough, along with a long, passion fruit finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Sur Peaux translates to “on the skins”—a maceration process that gives this wine its burnished copper hue. More importantly, it's crazy good: soft, supple, delicately spicy yet bone dry, with a buttery mouthfeel.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Instead of brawn and muscle, this ruby Ripasso offers elegance and finesse. The nose is redolent of polished black stone, Indian spice and loads of dried cassis and wild berry. There's a playful hint of sweet almond and cinnamon at the end.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"On the nose it's sweet, smooth and seductive, but that's where the sweet nothings end. The palate is super concentrated and intense, with almost overpowering blackberry and boysenberry fruit. A high-octane red if there ever was one, and that's all hammered home on the warm, menthol-laden finish.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
"Concentrated dark berry aromas are powerful on the nose, showing a touch reduced but minerally. The palate on this young Ribera wine is pure and potent but not fierce. Ripe, loamy blackberry flavors finish muscular, with just enough elegance and grace to confirm the wine's overall quality.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinto Fino
"A blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah all aged in neutral oak, it's jazzy and appealing with notes of blue fruit, raspberry, smoked meat and peppery spices showing good purity and richness. It's nowhere near as weighty as the labeled alcohol level might suggest.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend

"This wine is ripe, juicy and packed with fresh red fruits. It has the softest tannins, the whole point being that this wine can be drunk young. The aftertaste brings out acidity. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This opens with scratchy, slightly dirty aromas of blueberry and blackberry. The palate is heavy and jammy, but also somewhat raw and abrasive. Cherry and plum flavors are basic, while an inoffensive finish falls off quickly.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Here's a very palatable and plush Brunello with opulent aromas of red fruit, cherry, plum, mesquite, cola and smoky graphite notes. Pair it with steak in wild mushroom cream sauce.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso

"Like the label says, this Pinot Noir-based blend of multiple varieties is sugary sweet, with raspberry, vanilla and toast flavors. It's a refreshing and easy to drink.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Meaning “The Thief,” Il Ladro blends 90% Sangiovese, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot. A silky smooth blockbuster of a wine, it dances in acidity with bright cherry, clove and spice throughout. The tannins are well-behaved and in the background, the finish exceptionally long.",US-California-Red Blend
"Another successful Cab from Frazier, following on the heels of the outstanding 2008 vintage. Like that wine, this one is elaborately ripe in blackberries, cherries, currants and toasty oak, with a long, spicy finish. The structure is impeccable, showing firm tannins and fine balancing acidity. Great to drink now, and will age for at least 10 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The Cabernet is stiffened up with small amounts of Petit Verdot, Cab Franc and Malbec, resulting in a firm, herbal, but very well-balanced Bordeaux-style blend. There's compact cassis fruit, streaked with light stem, earth and herb. This is a wine that should improve with bottle age through 2019.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Velvety in texture, this is a concentrated yet finely wrought expression of modern-style Châteauneuf-du-Pape, matured in oak. Cherry and leather notes slide toward chocolate and espresso on the long, richly textured finish. Drink now–2025.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend

"Elegant and structured, this offers enticing scents suggesting wild berry, pressed flower, chopped herb and baking spice.

Drink 2019–2026.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"There aren't very many Cabernets from the small Chalk Hill appellation in eastern Sonoma County. This one is excellent, a worthy follow-up to the winery's 2007, offering smooth and rich tannins, with elaborate blackberry, cherry, cassis and mocha flavors. New oak plays a dominant role, but it should recede as the wine integrates over time. Give it 6–8 years in the cellar.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Pleasing toasty notes greet your first sniff, followed by apple pie fruit flavors with hints of plum and banana. It's a light, creamy, easy-drinking confection.",US-Washington-Chardonnay

"Leathery and somewhat green, this wine has yet to find its balance, combining 95% Cabernet Sauvignon with 3% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot. It veers between heavy, ripe tension and an underripe underbelly, finishing unsure.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Varietal Malbec is rarity from this appellation. This one brings aromas of purple fruit, barrel spice, black pepper, plum and spice that are followed by pitch-black-fruit flavors. The tannins bring a gentle squeeze.",US-Washington-Malbec
"Black cherry, currants and plums on the nose lead into a delicious balance of olive, plums and herbs on the palate.

Red and black cherry provide additional fruit flavor.",US-California-Zinfandel

"Like this one, many of the 2014 Hawke's Bay Syrahs are flashier than their 2013 counterparts. This wine features meaty, bacony elements that highlight plummy fruit, wonderfully silky, supple tannins, and a long finish. Drink now–2025.",New Zealand-Hawke's Bay-Syrah
"Riserva Cappellaccio is a pure expression of Aglianico that has embraced the scorching heat of the 2003 vintage to deliver warm tones of jammy fruit, tar, asphalt, resin and natural spice. The wine is broad and chewy in the mouth.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"With seven years in bottle, this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is what it is. The nose is stewy and raisiny, with baked berry notes. Like the nose, it feels raisiny and heavy. Flavors of raisin, fig and chocolate keep the theme going, while the finish is herbal and earthy in flavor, with heat.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Subdued aromas recall blue flower and berries, but overall the nose isn't very expressive. The one-dimensional palate offers red cherry but it's lean and short on freshness. This is starting to fade so drink now.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"This shows bold oak tones of toast and spice that will unwind with 3–5 more years of bottle age. Beyond the notes of cinnamon and tobacco, this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc shows austerity and complexity, with touches of dark plum and tangy barbecue sauce. Give it a few more years.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"A mix of plum and vanilla, this is an easygoing Merlot that's good for most group occasions and palates, muted in aroma but developed in flavor.",US-California-Merlot
"Raspberry, tomato leaf and a spot of rhubarb give the nose a crisp outlook. The palate is zesty and linear, with herbal strawberry and raspberry flavors kissed by oak-based mocha. Creamy on the finish, with spice more than residual fruit. A nice ride, and solid for Carmenère. Imported by Republic National Distributors.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Carmenère
"Aromas suggest passion fruit, crushed tomato vine and cut grass. The palate offers juicy grapefruit, lemon-lime and mint alongside crisp acidity.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Grillo

"A few swirls of the glass release delicate, enticing aromas of red berry, rose, iris, tobacco, new leather and star anise on this elegant, almost ethereal wine. The restrained palate sneaks up you, offering tart cherry, crushed strawberry, white pepper and a note of black tea alongside a backbone of firm, refined tannins. Still primary and tight, it needs a few more years to fully open up and develop. Drink 2020–2031.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"The nose is closed and gives a little lemon and chamomile lift. The palate is more expressive: concentrated lemon and mandarin zest play aromatically on a zesty, pure and very streamlined and dry palate. There is something incisive and intense about this. There also are glimpses of floral peachy edges that will only increase with age. This is ready now but has the stuffing to go the mileage: drink now through 2030.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Aromas of fresh-cut grass, citrus peel and yeasty dust are typical of the Casablanca region. A round mouthfeel offers proper acidic cut, while flavors of grapefruit, lime and bell pepper finish green but fresh.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc

"Loaded with finesse, this opens with aromas of pressed violet, perfumed berry, orange zest and whiff of forest floor. The vibrant palate delivers wild red cherry, tangy cranberry, baking spice, grilled herb and anise alongside firm, polished tannins and bright acidity. It's already tempting but give it time to develop fully. Drink 2018–2028.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Clean and firm, with strawberry fruit and an earthy base. Hints of compost and tobacco came through in both the scents and flavors, while tannins were moderately coarse. Drink soon.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"A selection of the better barrels from the Home Ranch, the Reserve is fantastically rich and complex. No mere fruit bomb despite scads of flavors ranging from apples and peaches through pears and mangoes, there's also a sleek backbone of steel, all of it wrapped in a rich, honeyed texture.

"Briny pickled aromas are just clean enough to pass muster. This simple Viura is lemony and tangy on the palate, with saline-influenced flavors of citrus fruits and bell pepper. On a snappy finish, a briny flavor leads the way.",Spain-Northern Spain-Viura
"Lighter in color, this is a great take on the fresh, vibrant and zesty style.

"Dark berry and baking spice aromas emerge from the glass and carry over to the juicy palate together with fleshy wild cherry, plum, black pepper, cinnamon and vanilla alongside big round tannins. Well balanced with great length, this poised wine already is accessible, so drink 2015–2019.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This red wine has brisk tannins that frame blackberry and currant flavors, with a meat note and lots of peppery spice. It's bone dry, and while it's a little rustic, it's easy to drink with lamb and beef dishes.",US-California-Red Blend
"Unctuous and earthy, this medium-bodied wine is more about subtle and savory herb notes than deep fruit. With its light fruit characteristics and bold spice elements, it will make a versatile choice for the table.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The steep Pfaffenberg vineyard, sloping straight down to the Danube River, is one of the top vineyards in Krems. This rich and complex wine has a fine perfumed character, laced with lemon and pear flavors. It has a touch of minerality in its texture, making a wine that should age over several years.",Austria-Kremstal-Riesling

"With 16 months in French oak, this is a big wine with big flavors. Fleshy black plum guts, black cherry, crushed African violet petals and a touch of tobacco appear in the bouquet, while cherry pit, pepper and cigar spice fill out the palate. Medium weight and lush in the mouth with solid tannins and acidity, this is a good choice now with strong meat dishes or a candidate to hold onto for a couple more years.",Israel-Galilee-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A lean, structured wine, with dense tannins, jammy fruit and dark berry flavors. The wood comes through strongly, offering high spice, and giving the wine a dry core.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red

The aromas are pristine and clean and the wine seems to emphasize elegance and harmony over intensity and penetration, closing with bright freshness and cherry cola flavors.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"If your impression of South America Malbec has been shaped by Argentina, then this Chilean example will be appealing. It's ripe and dense, with blackberry and animal hide aromas. The palate is rock solid in feel, with concentrated flavors of blackberry, cassis, cumin, pepper and chocolate. This gets oakier, darker and more compact on the finish.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Malbec
"The wine starts lively, almost fresh. Only after a while in the mouth do you taste the intense richness underneath. The structure is of pear skins, with white fig and sweet dried apricot syrup. The botrytis, dry at the heart of the wine, gives the whole ensemble great balance.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend

"From Stillwater Creek vineyard, this 80/20 blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon simply tastes young. The fruit is ripe enough, but superficial, with a lot of barrel flavors providing the weight and filling in with smoke, toast and coffee. Malbec has a very promising future in Washington State, and it's good to see young and talented wineries such as Tildio doing the exploration. Right now, this is just a pleasant table wine.",US-Washington-Malbec

"This wine carries a new label, very spare; the drawing of house and vineyard is gone; it's all white with simple type. The wine is simple, soapy, light and showing just a watery impression of citrus, banana and tropical fruits.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"A rounded, toast-rich wine, with the full creaminess of malolactic acidity very evident. This richness works, giving a sensuous, opulent style, just kept in check by the acidity, but very ready to let all its ripeness rip.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A ripe, tropical fruit flavored wine that is both fresh and rich. While produced in an area of Vinho Verde that is predominately dedicated to the Alvarinho grape, this dry wine is a refreshing, bright blend of many of the local varieties. It is juicy, crisp and ready to drink.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White

"Incredibly syrupy aromas of concentrated blueberry, blackberry, dried black cherry and kirsch show on the nose of this dense and dark bottling.

The cooked flavors are a little overpowering but also luscious.",US-California-Syrah

"This blend of 47% Grenache, 39% Syrah and 23% Mourvèdre packs dense fruit on the nose, showing plump blackberry and black plum, with touches of pepper, tar and charred beef. The palate is dry and leads with savory peppercorn and asphalt notes, then rounds out with blueberry and dried herb flavors, all balanced by spry acidity.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Hugely ripe, this is a dense and potentially intense wine. Its high alcohol brings out a disturbing pepper character that spoils the purity of the rich fruits and mineral texture. It shows the heat of the volcanic soil of Ragen de Thann Grand Cru in its rich fruits and ripe structure. It does need aging, so drink from 2017.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Oak dominates this wine, with toasty charcoal aromas and flavors. The underlying wine seems pretty simple, with blackberry fruit flavors. Doesn't seem capable of aging, so drink up.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This opens with earthy aromas of scorched earth, ripe berry, leather and a funky whiff of game.

Drink after 2018.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"This wine's shy nose suggests fig leaf and citrus. Green-tinged herbal notes and faint lime fruit swish sinuously n the light-bodied palate. It's slender yet creamy, lithe and full of personality. The finish is dry and refreshing.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"This is a bold wine with spice and pepper, but also great, juicy black fruits. The palate is rich—not too heavy—with layered blackberries and acidity over soft tannins. It's worth aging for 3–5 years but can be drunk now for its fruitiness.",Austria-Burgenland-Zweigelt
"This Cab is pretty thin in flavor, with some unripeness that gives it a green mintiness. However, it has a good core of blackberry flavor. Call it a rustic sipper and drink it now with simple fare.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is just recognizably Pinot Noir, full of tannins with a tight edge. Bitter cherry flavors and very fresh acidity give a mineral flavor that is only just showing juiciness. Drink from 2016.",France-France Other-Pinot Noir
"Rich and toasty in style, this has notes of ripe tropical fruits, figs, toffee and green herbs. The oak is prevalent and at times a bit too loud.",Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"Hints of smoke and wet stone combine with sweet Granny Smith apple and stonefruit aromas on the nose of this inviting dry Riesling. Smoke seeps through on the palate as well, melding with brighter flavors like orange peel and underripe tangerine, making for a refreshing yet deeply compelling sip.",US-New York-Riesling

"Aged eight years prior to disgorgement, then again in the bottle, the Brut Séduction is a testament to how utterly delicious aged sparkling wine can be. Creamy in texture, with baby-soft bubbles and a rich, umami-laden warmth, it's brightened by lemon-lime acidity and hints of orange blossom and citrus rind that linger.",US-New York-Sparkling Blend
"Calina's first attempt at a super Chilean is successful. The wine, a multiappellation blend, really pops in the mouth. The fruit is ripe and the power is there. However, for someone looking for a reserved red made in the Bordeaux style, something that Chile can deliver, this could come across as aggressive, as the acidity is a bit sharp.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Amarone has aromas of ripe fruit and evident oak. On the palate, it's a bit lumbering, with mature plum, toasted oak, espresso and chocolate notes. Drink now and over the next few years.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend

"Made with organically farmed grapes, this rustic wine opens with funky aromas of game, wet animal fur, scorched earth, overripe berry and a whiff of barnyard. These carry over to the palate along with underbrush, licorice, and toasted almond notes but not much fruit. Tried twice with identical notes.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nerello Mascalese
"Young and spicy, this medium-bodied red offers fruit driven sensations of blackberry, black currant, crushed plum and ground white pepper. Polished tannins and fresh acidity give it focus and a drink-now vibe, but it has the structure for modest cellaring. Drink through 2018.",Italy-Tuscany-Syrah

"This is a crisp, dry, and very tangy wine blended from Tocai Friulano, Pinot Blanc and Pinot Grigio. It sizzles with lemon, lime and green-apple flavors. While barrel fermented, it's not obviously oaky and seems to get its energy from high acidity instead. It will be brilliant with simply prepared shellfish, fried chicken or as a palate charger before a meal.",US-California-White Blend
"This estate-grown, pure varietal effort is exceptionally rich and succulent. The flavors of sugared grapefruit, lemon pulp and rind and sweet tea are concentrated and lingering. Despite the impression of sweetness, it's not a dessert wine, just an especially ripe and rich one.",US-Oregon-Viognier
"Heady scents of honeysuckle, acacia and yellow stone fruit lead the way on this radiant white. On the vibrant, elegantly structured palate, energizing mineral frames mature apple, white peach, fresh apricot and chopped mint. Hold for even more complexity. Drink through 2023.",Italy-Southern Italy-Greco
"Deep aromas of boysenberry, dried purple flowers and crushed slate show on the vibrant and fresh nose of this blend of 55% Grenache, 39% Syrah and 6% Petite Sirah from the Gleason family and winemaker Ryan Deovlet.

"A blend of Petite Syrah, Petit Verdot and Shiraz, this wine has a bouquet of black cherry and black pepper with a touch of green bell pepper. It is well balanced and has good mouthfeel, with flavors of black cherry, chocolate, thyme and oregano. Smooth tannins coat the palate into the slightly minty finish.",Israel-Judean Hills-Red Blend
"A ripe, still very young wine that has a rich, almost honeyed character while remaining bone dry and tightly textured. There is a mineral character to this wine that should disappear as it ages leaving the ripe pear and apple flavors and the elusive touch of honey. Drink from 2020.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"Stark acidity and vibrantly fresh apple and lemon flavors lend vitality to this traditional-method sparkling made entirely from Chardonnay. Fine, persistent bubbles build into a delicate foam on the palate. The finish is marked by a hint of earthen complexity.",US-New York-Sparkling Blend
"Pear and apple aromas receive a kick from some creamy, vanilla-tinged oak. The palate is mostly tangerine and lime, with some rich baked-apple undertones. The lengthy finish is solid, as is the mouthfeel. Best Buy.",Chile-Central Valley-Chardonnay
"Lots of tropical fruit, orange, lime, pear and buttered popcorn flavors in this Chardonnay. It's very bright in acidity, and is almost honey-sweet on the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay

"A bit heavy and granular on the nose, with oily aromas that raise question marks. Fortunately, the wine mostly tastes true, with apple-based lead flavors followed by some pithy bitterness. The finish registers as dull, yet there's still some grab to the wine. Seems to be fading.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Torrontés

"This new producer is off to a good start with its first vintage. The fruit is clean and complex, ranging from watermelon to wild strawberry to pie cherry as it washes across the palate. Deep in color, yet light in the mouth, this not only makes you reach for a second glass, it makes you wish the vineyard, planted in 2001, would hurry up and age.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This spent 24 months in 500-liter American oak puncheons, blended with 9% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Syrah. It is really showing the barrel influence, even after several hours of breathing time. The fruit is ripe strawberry, with fresh herbs, green olive and hints of tomato leaf. Good acidity suggests further bottle age would only improve this wine.",US-Washington-Sangiovese
"While the aromas speak of wood aging, the fruit comes through on the palate. It is firm, full and dry, and the fruity acidity and fresh black currant flavor backs up the structure.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is extremely lean and acrid, with flavors of yellow apple skin and bitter walnut but no fruit richness.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Inzolia
"It opens with raisin and stewed aromas, so its freshness is questionable. In the mouth, it's actually round, subtle and fairly well structured, with oaky vanilla accenting lightly herbal berry and cassis flavors. Herbal as well on the finish, with a lasting flavor of coffee.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon

There's a pretty blast of freshness, with forest berry and fresh currant notes on the finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Nero
"This is a wood aged wine, full of vanilla flavors as well as fragrant fruitiness. It has great flavor intensity, with bright notes of juicy green plum and grapefruit that are framed by acidity and a tight, mineral texture. It needs some years aging, so drink from 2018.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
Wood aromas provide a toasty character that dominates the fruit. It will take time for the apple and pear fruit flavors to show. Drink from 2020.,France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"There's a touch of burnt matchstick at the very start of this wine, but it later opens to reveal citrus, stone fruit and white flowers. The mouthfeel is lean and tonic and this easygoing white blend from Tuscany would pair well with seafood or chicken salad.",Italy-Tuscany-White Blend
"A light cedary, floral aroma starts this full-bodied wine on an interesting note, and similar flavor complexity continues. It feels nicely astringent on the palate, as fine tannins and good acidity keep it lively.",US-California-Grenache
"From estate-grown grapes, this opens with sizable, grippy tannins and strong barrel-heavy aromas. It then settles down into layers of blackberry and blueberry, sprinkled with a hint of cinnamon. This wine will benefit from a decant or a few more years in bottle.",US-California-Merlot
"Pierre Léon is a selection of different clones from the winery estate. Maybe it's the vintage, but the wine seems dilute. The flavors of tart wild berry, earth and herb have a thin, edgy character; and the tannins seem greener than what would be optimal.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A 50-50 blend of Cinsault and Grenache, this is a medium-bodied, plump, succulent rosé, hinting at grapefruit and underripe peaches. It's nicely balanced, with a long, slightly minerally finish. Drink now.",France-Provence-Rosé
"There's a raw cut of acidity that gives this simple wine a sour taste. On the plus side, it's nice and dry, with some cherry fruit. For the price, it's a helpful introduction to the charms of Pinot Noir.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Tight, tannic and bone dry, this ultralow production wine comes from the small, somewhat obscure Sonoma Mountain appellation. It aims high, with the Northern Rhône the model. The blackberry and black currant flavors have an edge of smoky oak. Judging from the way the wine gains interest in the glass as it warms, it should have a fine future.",US-California-Syrah
This is a wine that's made to be enjoyed young. It is fresh and fruity with a high proportion of Aragon (a.k.a. Tempranillo) giving a sophisticated touch of dusty tannins and red berry fruit. The wine is ripe and ready to drink.,Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"With scents reminiscent of an early morning hike through a foggy forest, it features aromas of cola, sassafras and a damp, earthen funk. It hits the palate with a medium body, delivering some violet florals at first and, with enough swishing, finishing on sanguine flavors of red meat.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Dense young tannins and 18 months in oak dominate the wine, promising a rich future. The fruit weight is all there, ripe blackberry flavors that will come through over the next months. Marie-Dominique and Jean Watrin have been the owners since 1994. Drink this concentrated wine from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Dry and brittle, with less than fully ripened cherry fruit. There's actually a vegetal edge, which makes the acids and tannins uncomfortably hard. A poor example of this celebrated vineyard.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The winery behind America's first Petite Sirah continues pumping out quaffable bottles, including this show of black plums, pressed violets, black raspberries, white pepper, licorice candy and dill on the nose. The palate offers boysenberries and baked oregano, with a tapenade-like zing on the finish.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"The 300 designation is the altitude at which the two vineyard soils mingle. This cuvée sees no wood. Aromatic and spicy, it shows bright berry fruit, hints of bitter greens and a streak of cola syrup. Excellent density and concentration for an Oregon Pinot in this price range.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Classic Dry Creek Zin, dry and firmly tannic and bursting with pepper, briary wild berry, tamari and chamomile flavors. Calls for a broiled steak, drizzled with garlic and rosemary-infused brown butter sauce.",US-California-Zinfandel
"The wine has fine, juicy fruit over smooth tannins. Its smoky flavors, touches of wood aging and rich tannic structure are integrating well. It will be ready to drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a soft, fruity and easy wine. With simple tannins and black currant fruit laced with spice, it's made to be drunk now.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"It's the Carmenère (14%) that pops first on this Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc-dominant blend. Aromas of braised jalapeno pepper are followed by coffee, vanilla and dark fruit. The coffee and cherry flavors are light, with some grit to the tannins and a warm finish.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"There's no shortage of ripe aromas: leather, berries and aged cheese. Yet the palate is quite sharp, with searing acidity sitting on top of red-berry flavors. This wine has unlimited aging potential, but will it ever taste great? That remains to be seen.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Maple-syrup aromas and a practically syrupy texture make this full-bodied wine taste sweet, while baking spices like cinnamon and vanilla accent the deep, ripe blackberry and black-cherry flavors. It's a very tasty wine for oak lovers.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This savory blend of 40% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 5% Syrah opens with aromas of roasted coffee bean, leather, tobacco and dark woodland berry. The chewy palate offers juicy plum, cassis and clove alongside polished tannins. Drink through 2019.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This perfectly embodies the fruit-forward, irresistibly delicious wines of the 2012 vintage in the Willamette Valley. Along with lively aromas of pepper and spice come brambly fruit flavors of just-picked raspberries and black cherries. It rolls into a lush finish with a streak of espresso.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Raspberry and strawberry aromas suggest fruit punch. This feels stocky and sticky due to low acidity. Flavors of plum and berry come with buttery oak notes, while this is short and hollow on the finish.",Chile-Central Valley-Pinot Noir
"This polished and structured Barolo presents rich fruit and floral scents of black cherry, plum and rose. The dark fruit and spice flavors layered with eucalyptus and balsamic notes are delicious. It's still young, with bracing but ripe tannins that need to soften, but this already shows great complexity.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Now eight years old, this Pinot Noir shines. Its aromas range from concentrated plum, earthy beet and rhubarb to balsamic vinegar and mint chip ice cream. The palate offers candied raspberry fruit, still fresh, with juniper and black tea accents that keeps one coming back for more.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A classic style of wine, this has reserved aromas but great texture and structure supporting deep black currant and dark plum flavors, accented by subtle spicy oak. With each sip more nuances of cedar, tobacco, sage and black olive come out. Although delicious now, it will be best after 2020.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a simple but appealing rosé, defined by strawberry fruit, hints of chalk dust and a mouthwatering finish.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"Confirming its place in the firmament of Pauillac greats, Clerc Milon's 2010 has huge density, and is packed with dark tannins and blackberry flavor.

"This big but harmonious wine made from white Rhône grape varieties pulls off the fully oaked style very well, starting with its buttered baguette aroma and continuing on the palate with baked apple and ripe pear flavors and smooth, creamy texture. It has a wonderful, lingering finish too.",US-California-White Blend
"From one of the most dramatic vineyards in the entire state comes a bottling almost as impressive. Refreshing Key lime and mandarin zest mesh with sea shells, chalk and honeysuckle on the precise, steely nose. A chalky tension binds the palate around flavors of lemon-lime, grapefruit flesh, nectarine and a touch of vanilla.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a fine wood-aged blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot and Petit Verdot. It is darkly colored, dense and with great ripe tannins. One of several Bordeaux properties owned by the Thiénot family, this estate occupies a fine, gravel outcrop in the Pessac-Léognan region, just south of Bordeaux. Drink from 2024.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Sourced from seven different vineyards across the appellation, this ripe Pinot is savory in flavor, seasoning the dark cherry fruit at its center with spicy cardamom and cinnamon. On the palate comes a taste of thick oak and bacon with sizable tannins.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Made from vines well over 100 years old on the Kunde Estate, this wine is tight and youthful in dry, dusty and grippy tannin, with thick, extracted flavors of red berry and cherry. A streak of pencil lead and fig provides further intrigue and complexity around a full-bodied elegance.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Pretty honest on the nose, where it's mostly melony, peachy fruit and no faux oak. The palate is on the sharp side, with blazing acidity and not much body to go with citrus and apple flavors. Hits you with a lot of juiciness and aggression but doesn't bring a lot of mouthfeel and complexity.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Chardonnay
"So thick and rich that it seems to fall apart in the mouth in pieces. There's rum raisin on the bouquet and then backing aromas and flavors of prune, orange rind, toffee, peanut and chocolate. It's rich, sweet and unctuous from start to finish, but with just enough balance and acidity to keep it upright. Sincere and delicious.",Spain-Andalucia-Pedro Ximénez

"Full of tannins and with the potential of ripe fruit, this wine is young, concentrated and powerful. The alcohol does show as a burn of pepper at the end, spoiling an otherwise well-balanced wine. Produced from a 200-acre vineyard in the Douro Superior, the wine should be ready from 2019.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"While it does have a light texture, this wine is also rich. With intense red-currant fruit, totally crisp acidity and a fine citrus lift, the wine is both fruity and zesty. It will be best drunk from 2018.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This is light in color and strikes the right strawberry tones. It's big and tannic, with weight and warmth on the finish.",US-California-Grenache

Buttercream and salted caramel are laced throughout the palate, where vanilla ash flavors on the midpalate are balanced by bitter apple skins and Meyer lemon pith on the backend.",US-California-Chardonnay
"After opening with graham cracker, plum and ripe berry, the wine settles into a thick and heavy place that's rich but bordering on cloying. This is a heavy style of Malbec that tastes of ripe black fruits and herbs. It's toasty, full, thick as can be and long on the finish. Drinkable now but could use a couple of more years for everything to mesh.",Argentina-Other-Malbec
"Brooding in dark cherry and earthy spice, this fully figured wine offers well-integrated oak. With a savory and powerful profile, it has a forceful grip on the palate accented by black tea, truffle and juicy vibrancy. From a mix of Dijon clones (37 and 777), some fermented whole-cluster, this is a structured, wine from a meticulously farmed coastal site.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Saffron and spice pepper fresh lemon and grapefruit aromas on this exceptionally sheer, savory dry Riesling. A haze of citrus flavors fall like gossamer on the palate, extended by layers of dusty minerals on the finish.",US-New York-Riesling
"Dry and leafy in the Cru Bourgeois sense of Bordeaux. And that makes sense given that it's Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Tempranillo from a cool, tough vintage. While not vegetal, the wine is herbal and nervous, with leafy notes and burnt brown sugar flavors.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"Aromas of golden raisins, fig, licorice and vanilla lead to full-feeling dark-fruit flavors, with the tannins bringing a sense of grittiness. Time might smooth things, but the aromas already seem a bit dried out.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a deliciously balanced, elegant wine. Its ample spice character is matched by the crisp white-fruit note and acidity. It is floral, perfumed and stylish.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"The Justine, a new, southern Rhône-style red blend from Avennia, is an expressive wine, with aromas of berries, plums and cassis. There's a whiff of smoked meat also, but the Grenache—roughly half of the blend—brings lovely fruit that trumps the rest. Delicious now, or cellar it for a few more years.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend

"This is a smooth and rich wine, with generous fruit alongside spice and ripe, black plum fruit accents. Ready to drink, it shows surprising balance between a perfumed character and an unctuous palate.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Shows the challenges of the 2008 vintage, which was alternately cool, hot and rainy in the North Coast. The wine is very dry and quite acidic. While it shows an elegant structure, it's a bit lacking in richness, and probably is not ageworthy.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Hints of spice lend an exotic feel to aromas of freshly pressed apples on this Riesling. It's off dry in style with ripe, juicy white-grapefruit flavor accented with piercingly high acidity. Finishes briskly on a slightly bitter note.",US-New York-Riesling
"This wine with great potential is produced by the husband-and-wife team of Jorge Serôdio Borges and Sandra Tavares da Silva. it is structured, although the fruit is already rich enough to indicate its ripe character. Drink this smoky, wood-aged wine from 2020.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"A lively, impressively fresh Aligoté, packed with green and citrus fruits, bubbling with bright vivacity.",France-Burgundy-Aligoté
"Made with 70% Nero di Troia plus other varieties, this features aromas of ripe dark berry, bell pepper, game and tobacco.

"The yellow apple, melon and spice aromas are bright and inviting. The palate is fresh and clean, with broad, vibrant flavors playing nicely against a tart finish.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Savory whiffs of clay and smoked nuts belie the pristine white peach and grapefruit flavors that flood the palate of this semidry Riesling. It's juicy and primary, but irresistibly so, finishing on a lingering note of spice and saffron.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Aged in 100% new French oak, aromas of roasted coffee bean, herb, char and dark fruit give way to lightly grainy dark-fruit flavors. The wood seems a bit primary at present but it still brings a lot of appeal. Give it some time to integrate.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Good, classic blackberry, currant, oak and mineral flavors in this dry, full-bodied wine. It's also pretty tannic, with an astringent mouthfeel. Doesn't have the stuffing to warrant aging, so give it an hour or two in the decanter and drink up.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The oak is strong on this blend of three of the winery's best vineyards. It shows up as buttered toast, with a distinctive, charry-sweet note of toasted marshmallows. The wine is strong in pineapples and oranges. An eccentric Chardonnay for drinking now.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Broad and pleasing aromas of yellow melon, sliced lemons, white peach and apple make for a chameleon-like nose mixing ripeness with restraint. Honeydew and cantaloupe flavors make for a plush palate, quite delicious although not too flashy.",US-California-Albariño
"A sweet, soft, clean wine, anonymous almost. Yes, there is freshness, lightness, but all the time the awkward, unbalancing sweetness pulls it down. Drink very chilled.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White
"Grown in red ironstone soil, this wine is dark and firm. It has solid tannins as well as succulent black fruits. Combined, the two give the wine its rich dense character. It's a ripe wine, likely to age for another few years. Drink from 2018.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Tempting aromas of cherries, raspberries, earth and light spices precede lively flavors of cherry, cinnamon and clove. These partner with medium body and a gentle texture that has just a touch of crispness and tannin.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The cool vintage shows in the brisk acidity, hard tannins and herb and mineral flavors that accompany the usual blackberries and spices. There's plenty of elegance, with the wine showing a highly refined structure. Drink now–2014.",US-California-Syrah
"This ripe wine opens with aromas of stewed black fruit, underbrush, prune, and a just whiff of farmyard. The palate reveals nearly overripe black cherry, cinnamon and clove alongside bracing, astringent tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"The 2015s Tavels are almost uniformly excellent, so it's no surprise that this bottling, from a large estate excels. Crushed stone and strawberry notes mark the nose, while the full-bodied palate folds in hints of savory, olive-like complexity. Drink now.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"Very fruity aromas hint that this is a bright wine, its tannins shaded by the red and black berry flavors. The structure is integrated, showing ripe as well as fresh fruit with final flavors of chocolate.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Lime aromas and modest minerality are proper given its origin, but it turns softer and sweeter the more time it airs out. The palate is fairly round, with lemon-lime and pineapple flavors. Citric if a bit pithy on the finish. Fine but average.",Chile-Maule Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a complex Chardonnay, with flavors of honey, tangerine, apricot and toffee that are balanced by the crisp, citrusy acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
High-toned but slight hints of caramelized pear lead onto a concentrated palate that is as governed by fresh acidity as it is by alcoholic heat. This packs a punch and will ideally paired with equally substantial food.,Austria-Thermenregion-Rotgipfler
"A strange bird for sure. The blend is 70% Chardonnay, 20% Sauvignon Blanc and 10% Picapoll. In no way is it common, and truth be told it lags far behind the winery's usually excellent reds. But it does have a lot of kick, body and tropical fruit. And for a unique Spanish white, it may draw some interest because it's not poorly made.",Spain-Catalonia-White Blend
"Even Grünhäuser's entry-level trocken is impressive in 2010, combining ample petrol-like notes with a pronounced streak of lime sherbet. It's medium bodied and slightly creamy on the midpalate, yet sharply focused on the finish.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"A bright magenta color and aromas of toast, tobacco, cola and wild blackberry draw you in. This wine is young, and so the acidity shows through right now. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and black cherry come with a touch of oaky vanilla. That vanilla carries over to the finish, which is oaky, bright and scouring. This Carignan-Garnacha blend will be at its best from 2018–2024.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"The winery continues a trend of fine, everyday Merlots at an affordable price with this dry, elegant 2009. It's full-bodied and deeply flavored with black currants and plums.",US-California-Merlot
"The Wiebelsberg Grand Cru is in Andlau in the north of Alsace. Its terroir, influenced by rocks from the Vosges mountains, gives a strong minerality to this wine. It has structure, a dry heart surrounded by ripe, generous fruits. As any Grand Cru, it needs to age, so drink from 2017.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"From a longtime vineyard source, this wine opens with dried herb and menthol aromas. It's exotic on the palate too, with seductive, silky-smooth texture and a tightness of acidity. Black cherry meets black tea and pomegranate, with just the slightest remembrance of cola. Drink now through 2023.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"The closed nose gives away very little, just the barest whiffs of yellow flowers. The one-dimensional palate offers fleeting sensations of tart apple and hints of green melon and lemon zest.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"This blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Grenache is enormously fruity. It erupts in the mouth with black raspberries and cherries, with a hint of smoky oak and raisins. It's a little rustic in the tannin structure, but refined enough to drink with a great steak.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend

"Pretty aromas of blue flowers, red berry and dark cooking spices lead the nose on this straightforward red. The bright, savory palate doles out wild cherry, cassis, clove and a dash of white pepper alongside silky tannins and fresh acidity. It's easygoing and made to be enjoyed young.",Italy-Tuscany-Cabernet Franc
"Penetrating notes of melon, stone fruit and white florals set apart this lavish Riesling from Anthony Road. Semisweet in style with honeyed fruit flavors, it's balanced by bracing lime acidity and crushed-stone minerality that extends the finish.",US-New York-Riesling
"Berry and cassis aromas are spicy and powerful, with integrated oak in support. This solid, tough wine features rugged but fair tannins. Savory berry, baked notes, leather and herbal flavors are very Cabernet-ish, while the finish is dry, firm and tannic. Age this until 2017–2022, or decant if drinking now.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This informal red shows subdued iris and baking spice aromas. It's easygoing on the palate, with raspberry fruit, a bitter almond note and smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto
"A single-clone, single-block cuvée, this is nonetheless complete and satisfying. Blackberry and black cherry fruit are dusted with cinnamon and allspice. A vein of cola and a whiff of sandalwood add further complexity. More elegant than powerful, this retains its balance through a medium-long finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Tight with tart cranberry acidity but juicy cassis flavor, this is a structured Cab with herbal undertones that'll serve you well in a series of settings, from midweek meals to casual gatherings.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Intriguing notes of sandalwood and cedar meet with dark red fruit and a touch of black pepper on the nose of this wine. The palate is layered with interesting touches of sage, marjoram, gravel and tar, hints of black cherry and loamy earth, and a chalky mouthfeel.",US-California-Merlot
"An added layer of wood spice and toasted oak gives this expression of Nebbiolo rounder and softer appeal. The concentration is also denser and the wine imparts plush cherry notes followed by tight tannins and a squeaky, polished mouthfeel. Drink after 2012.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A subtle note of caramel adds richness to the baked apple aromas on the nose. On the palate, hints of chamomile tisane add to the baked apple flavors. The body is taut and linear. Rounded hints of baked apple persist even on the dry, clean and fresh finish.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"An overtone of leesy yeast quickly gives way to lemony freshness, rounded out by hints of yellow plum and peach. Citrus also continues to be the focus on the palate: fresh zest of ripe lemons and Meyer lemons just edged by peppery spice. This is taut and very linear, streamlined, concentrated and slender but still tightly wound. This will relax into more spice and fruit with a little while in bottle. Right now it is a zesty, evocative mouthful of promise.",Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
"Mainly Pinot Noir, with some Chardonnay for brightness and citrusy zest, this brilliantly clean wine has an incredibly fierce mousse. It seems to boil in the glass, and the followup mouthfeel is as creamy and refined as any California sparkler in memory. The Pinot asserts itself in delicate touches of raspberries and strawberries. Delicious and compelling now. Try with sushi.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Simple and airy on the nose, with melon, apple and citrus notes. It's spritzy, healthy and citrusy in the mouth, with comfortable, familiar pineapple and melon flavors. Holds steady on the finish. Very nice for immediate drinking.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño

"This limited release wine is complex, dense and structured on the palate. It offers a lively contrast between perfumed black fruit and structured tannins, which should integrate well with further aging. Drink this serious wine from 2017.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
"Bright red fruits dominate this approachable wine that offers smoky tannins along with spice and acidity. With a fresh, fruity aftertaste, the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Crisp, red hedgerow fruits and wild strawberries add to the acidity in this wine. There is an edge of greenness, but there is also some weight. Certainly not a powerful wine.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This opens with aromas of oak, toast and a hint of white flower. The palate shows oak-driven spice, citrus zest, roasted coffee bean and yellow apple skin but it lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the dominant oak sensations.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Chardonnay
"A crisp light yellow in the glass, this is a well-priced wine for warmer days. Light grassy tones mix with faint peach on the nose, while the palate is dissected by strong acidity, offering rounded peach, a touch of green pepper and a cement-like minerality.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

It is distinguished by polished tannins and outstanding intensity on the palate.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Aromas of white spring flower, exotic fruit and an herbal note waft out of the glass. The medium-bodied palate offers white peach, pear, vanilla and toasted oak alongside modest acidity. A citrusy note closes the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Arneis
"An equal blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this is a crisper than other Champagnes in the Coutelas range. It is also still young with its bright green and citrus fruits and tense texture. Lively and fresh, it should be aged and not drunk before 2017.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Edging towards minerality, this is a textured wine, its acidity penetrating right through. This intense, crisp character is complimented by the balanced fruit with its ripe apricot and kiwi flavors. Age for 2–3 years. Screwcap.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"This individual and exotic wine boasts aromas of sweet bay leaves, dried apricots and crushed black pepper.

"91–93. Barrel sample. A fine, dense, opulent wine with a great sense of structure. It's dark and solid with tannins that are dense, dusty and brooding. It's likely to age well.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Sweet oak perfume comes from 25% new French barrels. The oak influence is well integrated with ripe fruit, firm tannins, good concentration and medium-full body. They add up to an enticing, complex and delicious wine that is very lively, a bit lean, and will age through at least 2019.",US-California-Syrah
"Lush and lavish in all the right ways, this blend of 70% Syrah, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Petite Sirah shows vanilla cream, clove chiffon and blueberry pudding on the nose. The palate packs more blueberry fruit as well as black pepper, graphite, espresso bean and toasted sage, all framed by a solid structure of tooth-coating tannins.",US-California-Red Blend
"Potent Malbec with aromas of leather, bacon, blackberry and smoke. It's thick and dense, but well balanced, with flavors of blackberry, cola, pepper and nutmeg.

"Rhubarb and tomato leaf are strongly present on the nose, followed by grassy flavors and a hollow, thin mouthfeel. Septima is Spanish-owned, and this 800-case bottling seems like a nod to the homeland. But it tastes anything but Spanish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Tempranillo
"Aromas of stone fruit and pineapple lead the nose. The vibrant palate doles out juicy yellow peach, nectarine zest and a hint of nutmeg. It's nicely balanced with tangy acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Müller-Thurgau
"No kidding that this was aged in oak (Criado en Roble). It smells charred and toasty, with resiny aromas thrown in. A full, seemingly healthy palate can handle the high level of wood this has, but, in the end, oak is mostly what this tastes like. A dry spicy tannic finish doesn't break the chain.",Uruguay-Canelones-Tannat
"Aromas of orange blossom and pineapple juice are not substantial. In the mouth, this is chunky and plump, with oily peach and nectarine flavors mixed with some green bean. A heavy finish with little spine provides minimal cut and freshness.",Chile-Central Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Tre Saggi, or three wise men, is a terrific wine at a realistic price. This luscious vintage shows bright fruit nuances of black cherry and currant backed by soft, oak-inspired aromas of spice, leather and tobacco.",Italy-Central Italy-Montepulciano

"Dry, briary aromas of field brush, black olive, herbs, berry fruits and saucy tomato are textbook Maipo. This is fresh, a touch choppy, and not overly heavy. Flavors of cassis, plum and vanilla carry over to the finish, which is fresh and bolstered by fine natural acidity. Drink through 2022.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This organic Cava opens with round, yeasty aromas of dusty spice and baked apple. It's juicy in feel, while flavors of mature, pithy orange and grapefruit end short, both in length and level of finesse. For something bright and fresh, this fits the bill.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Cream, plus jammy blackberry and blueberry aromas may trick you into believing that this wine's a Syrah, but the truth comes through on the palate, where sturdy, brambly blackberry flavors dominate. Finishes dry, with medium length.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir
"This oxidative style of Grillo shows notes of candied fruit, dried apricot, honey and toasted almond. It will appeal to those who enjoy bold, creamy wines.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Grillo
"This shows the variety's delicious spiciness, as well as ripened pear and honeysuckle flavors. Treading that fine line between dry and off-dry, it's an exotic accompaniment to Vietnamese, Ethiopean and Indian foods.",US-California-Gewürztraminer
"One of the more fairly priced blends from the appellation on the market, this mix of Bentrock, Radian, Rancho La Vina and Huber vineyards shows black cardamom, chai spice, lemon oil, eucalyptus and concentrated, aromatic black raspberries on the nose. Once sipped, flavors of sour cherry meet with juniper and pine herbals.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of oak, leather, plum, vanilla and espresso unfold in the glass. The concentrated palate doles out dried black cherry, blackberry jam, oak-driven spice and licorice alongside firm, fine-grained tannin. This has weight and a velvety texture but it isn't overly vibrant, so drink sooner rather than later.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"The underlying wine is fine, with brisk, cool-climate acidity framing peach, pear and pineapple flavors. But the oak layering tastes weird and unnatural, almost sweetly medicinal, which drags down the score.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The wine opens with an inky dark color and segues to thick aromas of black fruit, espresso, tobacco and spice. Most of the action is on the nose however, because the mild mouthful offers just enough structure and acidity to compliment those foods.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Shows good, Zinny flavors of berries, pepper, leather and tobacco, with riper notes of currants and even hints of raisins. Could be firmer in structure, but it's dry, and not too high in alcohol. Drink now.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Intense aromas of mature black cherry, licorice, leather and a balsamic note lead the nose and follow over to the palate along with cranberry and a note of pipe tobacco. Tightly packed, rather austere tannins provide firm support and need time to unwind. Drink after 2012.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Very rich, very flamboyant, a Chardonnay that rocks your palate with flavor, yet has the acidic structure and dryness to keep it from going over the top. Pure Bien Nacido in the wealth of tropical fruit and spice flavors, so nicely balanced with a deft touch of oak. It represents a step above the '05 and is a wine to watch.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Aromas of underbrush, tobacco leaf, leather, wild berry and a balsamic note take the lead. The palate offers juicy Morello cherry, black raspberry, licorice and sage alongside rather astringent tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"This is a simple Cabernet, but that doesn't mean it's not a good one. It is, and easy to drink for its upfront cherry, blackberry and toasty oak flavors.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A bit tight and dainty on the nose, with reserved apple custard and white-flower aromas, this top-level bottling shows lots of nerve and verve once sipped. It offers salt, lime juice and honeysuckle on the palate, with lots of tension that lasts long after the bottle has been opened. It's a well-structured white.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Violets, leather, vanilla, subtle oak and black berry sensations all meld together in the glass. The rich, concentrated palate delivers ripe black cherry and blueberry extract accented by mocha, cinnamon, clove, white pepper and mineral. It's soft and already extremely accessible, with velvety tannins, but will age well for the next five years or so. Drink now through 2019.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"A textured and layered Lake County SB that's rich, but savory in style. With a big mouthfeel and tropical taste, pair with richer fare, like crab or lobster in butter.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

"Smooth and ripe, this is a warm Grüner. It has white fruits, a delicious creamy texture, and a citrus finish. The wine is ready to drink, but could improve after a year. Screwcap.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"This likable wine has juicy and bright core, a mix of spicy cola-cherry and forest floor nested in firm, integrated tannins that works seamlessly on the palate. A full-bodied wine, it has power and grace.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine has a lovely nose with plenty of delicate floral nuances that come on the heels of bursting cherry, blueberry, almonds and smoked bacon. The mouthfeel is elegant and refined and there are sweet, nutty notes that carry through to the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Dave Corey co-fermented 83% Grenache with 17% Syrah to produce this rich wine, which offers nose-tingling aromas of blackberry brandy. It's soft once sipped, but also a bit brutal, with blood and barrel-age prominent alongside flavors of blackberry-peppercorn cake. Serve as dessert.",US-California-Grenache-Syrah
"A soft, simple but pretty wine, with slightly sweet, pie-filling cherry, raspberry, Dr. Pepper cola and baking spice flavors. Drink now.",US-California-Zinfandel

"There's no drop-off in this wine from the excellent 2005. Expect blackberry, cassis and dry balsam wood/cedar aromas. The palate is lush and chewy, but also vital and lively. Toasty, dark berry flavors get a softening of vanilla on the finish. A winner to drink now through 2013.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Blueberry fruit, purple flowers and licorice break through the very dense cloud of finely knit tannins that frame the entire experience of this best-of-house bottling. Dark-roast coffee beans and hints of blackberry fruit can be found once sipped, but this needs years to evolve. Luckily, it has the excellent tannins and bright acidity needed to do so.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Easygoing and fresh, this cheerful sparkling wine offers tonic fruit flavors of kiwi, lime and honeydew melon. The wine is firm and zesty and adds a playful touch of spice on the close.",Italy-Lombardy-Sparkling Blend

"A well constructed, solid wine, this has a fine layer of firm tannins that melds well with the rich black plums and acidity. Even this young, the wine is showing a balanced character, warm and ripe. It will age, so drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Fans of this variety will find something really interesting here. While the wine has the bigtime wild berry, chocolate, leather and spice flavors that Petite Sirah so dependably produces, it also boasts alcohol below 14%, giving it welcome balance. With thick, furry tannins, it's a guaranteed ager, if you like your Pets old.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"This is a beautiful, classic 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon, but it's also immature in hard tannins, which is a telltale mark of this mountain appellation. The wine is bone dry and complex, with waves of blackberries, black currants, cassis, minerals and cedar. It clearly wants time in the cellar. Best after 2013.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A touch of cranberry plays on the nose of this wine. The palate shows that same tart freshness, assisted by lemony notes and a slight spritz. An easy, uncomplicated and refreshing summer wine.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Rosé
"This medium-bodied wine has aromas that suggest strawberry jam and maple syrup, and equally fruity and ripe flavors. Touches of vanilla and chocolate add a bit of unctuous complexity, and the mouthfeel is velvety.",US-California-Merlot
"This savory Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend offers aromas of bell pepper, red currant and plum that carry over to the palate, along with toasted sensations of espresso and oak. Its linear structure will pair well with grilled chicken seasoned with rosemary and grilled vegetables.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Soft, open wine, with some attractive perfumed character as well as light acidity. It is somewhat unfocused, missing structure. Screwcap.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend

"The best wine in the El Origen portfolio is this Torrontés from northerly Cafayate. It's true to the blueprint, showing fresh lychee, honeydew and acacia aromas, which are followed by lemon-lime flavors, green-herb notes and a touch of citrus pith.

"Riserva Broglio Barolo from Schiavenza opens with generous tones of red berry fruit, spice, vanilla, polished mineral, licorice and cola. It is already showing some delicate tertiary aromas and, in the mouth, you can feel the fine texture of the tannins. Hold five more years.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

Nothing about this screams out for individual attention, but the sum of its parts amounts to something very good.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fruity in black plum and ripe raspberry, it's structured and weighty on the palate, dark and brambly with firm, substantial tannins. The grapes come from both Rancho Carneros and the mighty Hyde Vineyard, both sites planted to relatively older vines, which show through in this wine's savory side.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Very sweet and rich in honeyed citrus and vanilla flavors, this dessert wine suggests white cookies and cakes as partners. It's not particularly complex, but it is deliciously easy to drink.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"This wine is a blend of top sites Les Collines, SJR and Red Willow. It's perfumed with notes of green olive, violets, dried herbs, mineral and smoked meat. The palate is tightly wound, sensuous and supple, lithe yet rich with tart fruit and savory flavors backed by tannins that need more time to come into their own—but this wine surely deserves it. It has all of the stuffing to be a 20+ year wine. Best from 2025 to 2032. Give it an extended decant if opening in the near term.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Still wrapped up tight, as are most of the 2014s from Elk Cove, this offers juicy fruit flavors of pomegranate and raspberry, supported by fresh acidity that promises some years of aging potential. This harmonious, flavorful wine should be drunk from 2018–2030.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"It's unbelievable that this Chardonnay is unoaked, it's so incredibly rich and creamy. Just packed with layers of tropical fruits, peaches, Asian pears and oatmeal cookies. All that butter and cream must be from the malolactic fermentation and aging on the lees. One of the best unoaked Chardonnays ever.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Roasted black fruits, animal notes and a strong whiff of black olive make for a wild and wooly bouquet. The palate on this Carignan is direct and firm, with exotic berry flavors, herbal hints and well-applied oak. Blueberry notes and bold acidity push the finish. Drink through 2017.",Chile-Maule Valley-Carignan

"This balanced, ripe and full-bodied wine has good concentration and fine tannins that come from the wood aging and the juicy black fruit. It's an impressive wine, for aging 4–6 years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A little air unlocks aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, blue flower, toasted oak and mature berry. On the firm palate, notes of espresso and licorice add some depth to the core of dried black cherry while grippy, close-grained tannins provide support.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Rubbery and firm on the nose, with generic berry and cassis aromas. The palate is mostly clean, with a candied, almost creamy feel supporting jammy blackberry, cassis and baking-spice flavors. Finishes sweet yet herbal. Pretty much as you'd expect for a 65,000-case product.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a blend of 45% Syrah, 33% Grenache and 22% Mourvèdre. Strong aromas of eucalyptus leaves dominate a thick tannic concentration of dark cherry and cassis with a light simplicity to the finish.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Too soft and sweet, like melted raspberry jam. Feels tired and syrupy.",US-California-Barbera

"Light to the point of being a bit dilute, this Viognier has a cotton-candy character, like spun sugar around rhubarb. The tart, not quite fully ripe fruit brings it to a quick, acidic finish.",US-Oregon-Viognier
"Cabernet Sauvignon (54%) takes the lead on this blend, followed by Merlot (23%), Cabernet Franc (13%), Malbec (6%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of fresh herb, flower, pencil lead, cherry jam and spice lead to light tart, fresh fruit flavors. The tannins bring a bit of grip and dryness that hopefully smooths out with some additional time in the bottle but it has the stuffing to go the distance.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a taut wine that's full of zest, acidity and delicate wild strawberry fruit. It has a hint of orange and almond, with a great crisp feeling.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Candied apricots, blossom honey and notions of orange zest take turns in dazzling the nose and palate, while musky botrytis lends a rounded note to the mouthfeel, melding all together into sweet BA harmony. Simply lovely, now or in future years.",Austria-Burgenland-White Blend
"A slight note of pear drop plays on the nose. The palate is juicy and vivid with citrus, green pear and some white pepper. Light on its feet, with an energetic force at its core and lovely concentration of citrus and herb notes, this fizzes away pleasantly. This is far too easy to drink and very, very refreshing.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"A little oaky and leathery at first, but as a whole this wine sings a nice song. The palate is firm and structured, with a lot of forward oak as well as juicy wild blackberry flavors. Lightly roasted and salinic on the finish, with length.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Malbec

"With overtly sweet orange and apricot fruit flavors, this qualifies as a dessert wine. The honeyed flavors are fortunately balanced with bright, crisp acidity. Nice this summer on the beach, with fresh fruit and ham sandwiches.",US-California-Moscato

"Intense tannins and full body make this Syrah difficult to savor at this point, but it may round out with aging. It smells like smoke and black pepper, and tastes like grilled beef and blackberries. It is firm and astringent in texture, tight and concentrated in flavor. Best after 2018.",US-California-Syrah
"Apart from being part of a sparkling wine blend, Aligoté is found in the Côte Chalonnaise where it produces ripe full wines. They have a delicious crisp green fruit and floral character. It is a wine to drink young and fruity, so drink now.",France-Burgundy-Aligoté
"The Reserva version of the popular Borba brand in Portugal is a dense, powerfully tannic wine.

"The '06 vintage was kind to the winery's basic Sauvignon Blanc, providing a clean, crisp, dry white with flavors of lemon, lime, pineapple, nectarine and honey, and a zingy touch of tart gooseberry. Shows a complexity you don't usually find at this price.",US-California-Fumé Blanc
"Here's a simple and lean Ripasso that could pair with white beans and grilled sausage. There are bright fruit flavors here and enough acidity to cut through meat dishes, yet the wine is fundamentally easy and informal overall.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This early peek at Margerum's 2012 Rhône-style red wines holds the promise of future great releases from the acclaimed vintage. The wine, a blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre, Cinsault and Counoise, is enormous in ripe red cherries, red currants, cola and oak flavors, and while the acidity is fine, it's soft enough to drink now.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This Prosecco Superiore doesn't offer the roundness of other wines in its category, but it does offer an easy-drinking experience with fresh fruit, sweet peach and creamy perlage.",Italy-Veneto-Glera

"This luminous sparkler opens with aromas of jasmine, orange blossom and white peach. The crisp, refreshing palate doles out green apple, Bartlett pear and white almond alongside vibrant acidity and a silky mousse.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"This bottling has a solid track record from Envy, but the 2010 vintage, good as it is, is their least successful in years. While it's luscious with blackberry and blueberry jam, mocha and oak sweetness, it's one-dimensional, and lacking ageworthiness. Drink now, with sweet, smoky barbecued meats.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"This nose is a lovely mix of lemon peel and camphor leaves, intriguing and refreshing and just a little heady. The palate is streamlined and slender and of great purity.

"This is a compelling red for those who like a bit of mystery: is it red or black cherry? Or possibly, dark, aromatic elderberry? Oak spicily supports this interchange of fruit, and firm tannins lend structure while the fresh acidity keeps it lively. It's almost like a whole cast of characters were lined up in this wine for your entertainment. The lingering finish is especially convincing. This will get even better with cellaring; drink from 2016.",Austria-Burgenland-Blaufränkisch
"There is a smooth, wood-aged character to this wine, along with attendant firm tannins. Chocolate and black fruit show extraction and bring some bitterness. Austere at the moment, this wine needs time.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

The palate brings out the peach but also a zestiness reminiscent of grapefruit peel, making for a crisp texture. Full of flavor this has a rounded midpalate despite the slender body.",Austria-Südsteiermark-Sauvignon Blanc
"This 100% Merlot is soft and fleshy, with a raw meat note to the cherry, violet and smoky vanilla flavors. Feels considerably lighter than a Cab, but still important. Good with roast prime rib, which Cabernet would swamp.",US-California-Merlot
"The poster child for too much oak. Swamps with buttered toast, caramel, butterscotch and vanilla flavors that are so sweet, it's almost like a dessert wine. There's lots of tangerines, pineapples, apricots and apples, but those barrel influences are too much.",US-California-Chardonnay
"With more than a quarter of million cases of this wine coming to the U.S., Nobilo's Regional Collection SB will turn up on a lot of tables over the summer—and justifiably so. It's a very good rendition of Marlborough Sauvignon, offering grassy aromas and flavors backed by lime and grapefruit. It's plump enough to have mass appeal, with a refreshingly crisp finish. Like almost all NZ Savvies, it should be consumed over the next 6–9 months.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"A zesty, citrus-accented wine that features aromas and flavors of lemons and limes, piecrust and minty herbs. Finishes clean and refreshing—a racy wine that nevertheless isn't lightweight.",Australia-New South Wales-Chardonnay

Herbal, roasted black-fruit and chocolate flavors are long and oaky on the finish, with a mocha note. Drink through 2020.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
This Champagne is soft and has some sweetness (although technically Brut). Ripe melon and pear fruits are cut with enough acidity to keep the wine fresh and fruity.,France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Really nice and lush, with an aromatic mix of tobacco, baked fruit, mocha, vanilla, shoe polish, earth and more. It displays a ripe, friendly feel and yummy flavors of mocha, chocolate and savory, subtle berry fruits. Layered on the finish, with lasting notes of fig, mocha and blackberry. Drink now through 2012.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo

There's a pungent or slightly volatile note of fresh cedar or red apple that dominates this wine and leaves little room for the wine's natural complexity to show. This Barolo is also less active in the mouth and tastes older than it really is.,Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This is a sound, rustic red wine. It's comprised of undisclosed varieties, but tastes basically like a Rhône blend, with simple cherry, cola, herb and oak flavors.",US-California-Red Blend
"This small-production wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percents of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot.

A mix of savory and fruity, the finish is subtle in white pepper. Cellar through 2022.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a major Douro wine from the Poças family-owned Port and wine producer. Dusty tannins already give it class as well as richness.

"The 2007 Excelsus is a gorgeous super Tuscan expression (with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) that shows quality and superior fruit on all levels.

The wine's texture is exceedingly smooth, rich and long lasting.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"Produced from vines a half century old, this is fermented completely dry yet retains a distinct floral/talc character.

"This is the first vintage for this wine, made by Syncline's James Mantone. A delectable blend of 48% Mourvèdre, 28% Grenache and 24% Syrah, aged in 100% neutral oak barrels, this is a sappy, concentrated, mouth-pleasing blast of plum, cherry and spice. As it rolls across the palate, the distinct impression is of chocolate-covered cherries.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Earth and black tea meet forest floor notes in this dark, brooding and powerfully full-bodied wine. A touch of reduction accentuates the profuse oak, recalling clove and cardamom, as tingling acidity vies for attention and integration.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"While the nose of this ethereal, lithe Riesling is a bit bashful, glorious shades of tangerine, quince and peach await on the palate. High-toned acidity pierces through sweet honey and nectar, darting into a long, minerally finish. It's stunning now, but should develop with integrity for at least another decade.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling

This wine is spicy with ripe tannins and juicy berry fruits. It is soft and ready to drink with its balanced fruitiness and acidity.,Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Opulent yet so elegant, this wine has already achieved great balance.

And, at the end, just to give a great lift, along comes the acidity.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Classic Monterey Pinot, dry, crisp, silky and ripe. The fine 2007 vintage has made it explosive in cherries, currants, sassafras and cola, with refined, new oak notes of smoke and spice. Drink this rich wine now through 2013.",US-California-Pinot Noir

The palate packs a wide array of flavors, from anise to lavender to cracked peppercorn, with savory tar, dried elderberry and even some elderflower showing as well.",US-California-Syrah
"A deliciously fruity wine, its bright apricot, pineapple and peach flavors open and generous. Of course, there is a more serious core of structure, lemon zest and dryness to promise aging. At the end, though, fruit and a light toastiness give immediate pleasure.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

Wonderful to see this veteran Napa producer remaining vital and relevant after all these years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

The palate shows muddled flavors of overripe black cherry, bitter dried sage, vanilla and espresso with notes of sweet-and-sour soy sauce alongside fleeting tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"The floral fragrance recalls red roses, violet and iris along with ripe red berry. The palate has tight core of black cherry accented with white pepper, cinnamon-spice and thyme. This is still young and tightly wound so give it time to come around and develop complexity. Drink 2015–2010.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"The aromas of this wine from a vineyard in the Corralitos area somehow reflect its orange color (perhaps due to three weeks of skin contact), with orange rose petals and iced rooibos tea, yet with a steely minerality more common in pale white wines.

There is plenty of supporting acid, along with rather astringent tannins that carry a leafy note through the finish. Drink now–2019.",US-Washington-Syrah

Very refreshing and poised.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"Lucien Lardy takes the risk of not using sulfur during fermentation, giving a wine that retains its great fruitiness. It's bright, full of red cherry fruits and lively acidity.

"This impressive wine, packed with both fruit and tannins, is just setting out on a long road of aging.

Persistent acidity carries the palate into flavors of gravel, lemongrass, lime and lemon-lime.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Higher in alcohol than Kenwood's regular '05 Sonoma Zin, this one's hotter and more full-bodied. It's got a density that can stand a little bottle age. Give it two or three years to soften, and let the blackberry, cherry and coffee fruit emerge from the tannins.",US-California-Zinfandel

"High Slopes begins tannic and tight but settles down into a finely honed Syrah of notable structure, layered in pepper, smoke and tart blackberry flavor. It will pair deliciously with savory dishes along the lines of cassoulet or roast game and cellar another 5–10 years.",US-California-Syrah
"This is a benchmark rendition of Pinot Gris. The flavors are fruit driven, with lime, apple and pear notes combining on the smooth, relatively soft midpalate. This is a consistent wine, even with its production level of 100,000 cases.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris

"Grenache is being treated with more and more respect around Australia, which means more bottlings are reaching the variety's potential.

The disparate elements converge in a harmonious finish that invites you back for another sip.",Australia-Australia Other-Chardonnay

Nonetheless, the wine has an attractive, crisp and clean character and will pair well with grilled seafood and poultry.",US-New York-Gewürztraminer
"Mellow balsamic-like aromas of herbal berry fruits, tobacco and vanilla lead to a juicy, easy-flowing palate.

The family began making their own Champagne in 1971; now Sylvain Dautel works the vineyard by hand and makes the wine for this small maison.

Drink this mature, well-balanced wine now.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend

It's all about nuance.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

Caramel apple meets a complement of crisper green apple, finding balance and grace in the glass.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Dilute and pickled, with similarly pickled citrus and melon flavors that lose direction along the way. Rather weak and mealy wine, with a strange profile that has to be due to the Malvasia/Viura marriage.",Spain-Northern Spain-White Blend
"Dark chocolate, black cherry and a hint of raspberry fill the nose and palate, with secondary floral hints. This blend of Blaufränkisch and Merlot is slender but muscular, with immense structure, ripe tannin and en edge of iron-oxide. It has the graceful but strong physique of a male ballet dancer.

Drink through 2026.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro
"Dark gold in color, this estate wine from hillside vines aged 11 months in one-third new French oak.

A bright spark of lemony acidity marks the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay

"The Bully is a stiff, tannic, earthy and tight young wine, chewy and cherry-flavored; deep and hard and dense. Young as it is, the wine tastes of cassis, cherry, tobacco and oak. It mostly just needs a lot of time to breathe and a couple more years of bottle age.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon

The just-ripe fruit conjures pear and cucumber flavors, with a slice of green melon on the side.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris

"Aromatically, this wine is still shy on nose and palate. Underneath that the linearity and inherent slenderness of ripe tangerine flesh and zest come though, enriched with an earthy notion of ripe pear.

Drink 2019–2030.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"This intriguing wine shows the depth and staying power of this historic region.

Here the grapes are sourced from the Red Willow (Yakima Valley), Bacchus (Columbia Basin) and Klipsun (Red Mountain) vineyards. Supple, with beautifully integrated red fruits, and tannins as soft as a kiss, it's masterful winemaking from Chris Peterson, who tended the wines of DeLille for many years.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Yes, it's a good price, but this SB from Mendocino has loads of green pepper and peach fuzz that overpower its otherwise varietally familiar acidity and texture.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"A note of charred turmeric adds an exotic touch to the red plum and caramel aromas. The elevated acidity is the palate's driving force, thrusting outward, overshadowing the tannins that have the quality of powdered sand.",US-Virginia-Cabernet Franc
"Smoky aromas and a bold apricot flavor give this dry and seemingly light-bodied wine a distinct personality. Fermented in small concrete egg-shaped vats, it's far from simple and fruity, and instead offers great acidity and a tangy, tempting, appetizing personality.",US-California-Grenache Blanc
"Elegant and tightly wound kirsch, crème de cassis, charred beef and toffee aromas show on the nose of this blend of 55% Merlot and 45% Cabernet Sauvignon. Its toffee flavor is laced with chocolate and charcoal on the palate, and its sticky tannins need time to smooth out. Drink 2019–2029.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Fantastically bright acidity defines this wine, the winery's “finest selection,” which is memorable for its crisp black cherry and strawberry core of fruit. Voluptuous and silky on the palate, it carries a hint of Asian spice throughout, the slightest taste of wild vanilla wrapping things up on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Juicy white grapefruit and lime flavors penetrate throughout this juicy, off-dry Riesling. It's refreshing and quaffable yet elegantly structured, finishing moderately long on a lingering lime-pith note.",Germany-Rheinhessen-Riesling
"Milk chocolate, plastic and wet dog aromas improve with airing. It's abrasive and scratchy on the palate, with blackberry and milk chocolate flavors that lead to a finish with one last dosage of milk chocolaty sweetness. This contains 15% Garnacha.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"This is a fresh and fruity wine with lively acidity and spice from wood aging. Dominated by Sauvignon Blanc, it is herbal and still young, needing time to develop. Drink this crisp wine from late 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Lots of ripe raspberry, cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors in this Pinot Noir. It has elegant, silky texture, with bright acidity, but you do want to drink it now before the fruit fades away.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This leads with blue flower, camphor, crushed herb and red berry aromas. Firmly structured and linear, the palate delivers succulent red cherry, crushed strawberry, cinnamon and star anise flavors supported by a backbone of vibrant acidity and firm, refined tannins. Drink 2022–2032.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This big-boy, 100% varietal Cab is reflective of both its vintage and provenance, a celebration of black pepper, blackberry and tar around an intensely full-bodied, bittersweet palate. Tobacco leaf and leather saddle interweave themselves through the wine's middle and end. Drink now through 2020.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of cabbage, tomato leaf and green berry fruits tell you all you need to know. The wine is green but thick, with an unctuous meeting of sweet and underripe flavors as well as a gooey mouthfeel. Just one of a million weak wines from the high plains of Spain.",Spain-Central Spain-Red Blend
"A concentrated but restrained wine that is a bit like French couture: timelessly elegant, quietly confident but incredibly well-made and fitting. The tannins provide structure without being obtrusive. Oak plays a sonorous supporting role and dark cherry beckons on the nose and palate, all concluding in a peppery, long finish. Ready now but will keep till 2016.",Austria-Carnuntum-Zweigelt
"Equal parts fruity and savory, luscious and composed, this full-bodied Pinot Noir offers keen balance in a satisfying package. Fleshy black-cherry and plum flavors are concentrated without seeming jammy. Nuances of mushroom, cedar, toast and spice are harmonious, lifted by brisk acidity and a frame of soft, filigreed tannins. It's lovely now but should continue to improve through 2025.",US-New York-Pinot Noir
"Baked, raisiny aromas indicate a very ripe wine. This feels full and heavy on the tongue, with dark, toasty flavors that turn bitter, oaky and peppery on the finish.",Chile-Curicó Valley-Merlot
"This smells smoky, meaty and slightly earthy—in an attractive way—and tastes almost as savory as it is fruity. Flavors resemble ripe plums with added cardamom, cinnamon and dried fennel. The texture is ultrasmooth and it seems to melt in the mouth, leaving a soft impression on the finish.",US-California-Tempranillo
"All of the new Epica wines from San Pedro seem highly manufactured and sweet. This blend is stalky and murky smelling, then heavy and cloying in the mouth, with sugar-meets-herbal flavors that finish hot and syrupy.",Chile-Central Valley-Red Blend
"Soft, subtle flavors of classic Chardonnay mingle with warming spice in this friendly but simple white. Pair with salad or seafood.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Elegant and clean, this Brut Satèn sparkler boasts a feminine side thanks to its soft perlage and delicate aromas of peach blossom and honeysuckle. It's an attractive and fresh wine that remains compact and composed to the finish.",Italy-Lombardy-Chardonnay
"Bonterra sources organically grown grapes from both Mendocino and Lake counties to craft this light, slightly sour white generous in kiwi and a pronounced aroma and taste of honeydew.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Spice and herb notes accent smoke and earth on this bristling off-dry Riesling. The palate boasts pretty floral tones against ripe white-grapefruit and peach flavors, along with an acidic backbone that drives the finish long and steely.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"This is a generous white from the famous vineyard site, robust in toasted oak and big flavors of butterscotch and vanilla. Youthful, it opens in the glass to find more of its ripe fruit, from Gravenstein apple to baked pear.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Exceptionally ripe with fruit, this wine is super sweet with cherry jam, red currant, vanilla fudge, caramel and smoky, buttery toast flavors. A brisk hit of acidity adds balance. The alcohol is high, but the heat is in keeping with the overall structure.",US-California-Primitivo
"This Octagon is dark and charred smelling, with aromas of blackberry, cocoa, savory spice and cherry. The palate is tight yet finessed, bearing vigorous yet manageable tannins that should eventually fade with time to reveal a charming wine. Flavors of graphite, fines herbes and coffee grounds add interest to the finish.",US-Virginia-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"An exotic Chardonnay, this is reminiscent of a Rhône white wine, with its honeysuckle, mineral, apricot, tangerine and sautéed banana flavors. It's certainly savory. Don't drink it too cold.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A solid and nuanced sip of this varietal for a fair price, this bottling of older vines from Paso's eastern flanks shows plump elderberry and cedar on the elegant nose. A smoked-chocolate flavor hits the palate, bolstered by blackberry syrup, white pepper, bay leaf and dried basil, with plenty of both tannin and acid.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Softened by 20% Merlot, and aged in a healthy majority of new French oak, this is a smoky, smooth and tannic wine with savory characteristics of pencil and cedar that outweigh the fruitier aspects of mountain blackberry.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made with equal parts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Alicante, this has earthy aromas of black-skinned fruit and game. The dense palate delivers prune, toast and tobacco alongside gripping, rather drying tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Light and simple, with green apple and citrus aromas and flavors. Use it to wash down steamed shellfish at the beach.",Portugal-Bucelas-Arinto
"Rose petal, violet, red berry, white pepper and eucalyptus scents meld together on this bright, structured expression of Nebbiolo. The linear, elegant palate doles out juicy red cherry, mint, aromatic herb and star anise while firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework. It's already accessible but will also age gracefully over the next several years. Drink through 2024.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This budget Riesling sets a good standard for the style and the price. It's off-dry, low alcohol (11.5%) and solidly varietal. The fruit is full bodied and ripe, with vivid peach and apricot flavors. Additional notes of honey and lemony breakfast tea keep the finish up and running.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Ramitello is a beautiful wine (85% Prugnolo and 15% Aglianico for power and structure) with soft, lush aromas of chocolate, espresso, leather, clove and dense blackberry fruit. The wine is yielding and generous and has absolutely no sharp edges.",Italy-Southern Italy-Red Blend
"Very citrusy aromas of fresh squeezed lemons grow rounder with pear and nectarine flesh, all cut by a white rock minerality, without many of the typical grassy notes. The palate is very tight with lime juice and green apples, and driven by chalky grip and vibrant acidity.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Produced at Domaine la Gemière in Sancerre, this ripe full-fruited wine is perfect to drink young. Packed with citrus fruits with a strong mineral edge, the wine is rich and floral. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Not a whole lot of oomph in this dry, unidimensional Merlot. It's properly structured, with fine acids and tannins, but the cherry and currant fruit is diluted.",US-California-Merlot
"Dry, well-balanced and not heavy-handed, this medium-bodied wine has a firm, lightly grippy texture and tasty fruit flavors. Cinnamon and nutmeg accents meld with just-ripe black cherry and black plum on the palate and echo into the finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Seductive, spicy oak in the aromas and flavors puts a great spin on this medium-bodied, velvety smooth wine from a promising new winery in Northern California. Some ripe black-cherry and cranberry flavors chime in as well, supporting the toasted baguette, cedar and nutmeg nuances and layering seamlessly.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Can Syrah get any richer than this wine? It has massive flavors of chocolate, licorice, blackberry pie, brown sugar, exotic spice and sandalwood that taste sweet yet finish dry and smooth. The tannins are so thick, you will need steak or lamb to wrestle them to the ground. Drink now–2016.",US-California-Syrah
"This is rich, ripe, fat and seemingly oaky. It may be too much of a good thing. Massive in caramelized, butterscotch, pineapple, peach, apricot, lime and cotton candy flavors, it might overpower any food you have it with. Almost better as a cocktail sipper.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Produced from Niellucciu, this wine is ripe, perfumed and also packed with crisp acidity. Fresh raspberry, citrus and a touch of caramel are brought comfortably together by the acidity and zesty aftertaste. Drink now.",France-France Other-Rosé
"Still young and needing additional cellar time to achieve full integration, this dark, brooding Brunello opens with very masculine aromas of Spanish cedar, root beer, forest floor, dark fruit and bramble. There's still slight bitterness on the close and a firm tannic bite.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Shows the very dry herbal, floral and tobacco flavors that often mark Napa Chardonnays (and the vineyard is on the Napa side of Carneros). But there's a good core of tropical citrus fruits, while oak adds needed richness of smoky vanilla and buttered toast. Drink now.",US-California-Chardonnay
"From a great Champagne vintage, this rich, full-bodied wine is just beginning to develop secondary flavors, toast and walnuts. The red fruits are fading into the background, while keeping the acidity in place. It is ripe, well balanced and has a delicious, long aftertaste. It is ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Prices for this estate's wines have skyrocketed, but there is no doubting the quality in the bottle. The 2009 Cuvée Réservée is a huge wine, overflowing with intense black cherry and plum flavors to the point of seeming a bit sweet. Yet it's all framed by strong yet softly dusty tannins that should see it age well for at least 15 years.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Oaky, nutty, slightly oily aromas lead to a regular-feeling palate with resiny weight. Salty, lightly oaked flavors of stone fruits don't change much on a finish with melony flavors and light barrel notes.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"Rustic and funky, with a curious nose sending up scents of fruit, musk, soy, pepper and espresso. Flavors are vivid and grapey, and there is a penetrating spicy note running throughout. The finish is tannic and rough.",US-Oregon-Cabernet Franc
"A good Pinot, this is perfectly acceptable for everyday purposes. Maybe it's a little pricy, but you get a dry, tart wine, with cherry, cola and mushroom flavors. Drink up.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Light, creamed apple fruits with a bright line of fresh acidity. The wine is exuberant in its citrus character, just broadened by an underlay of green apples.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Le Châtaignier is a luxury cuvée of the domaine's oldest vines, approximately 96% Grenache and 4% Mourvèdre. Bright red fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry are complemented by coffee and chocolate notes (the wine spends four months in oak). For a 2009, it's crisp and on the firm side, so give it until next year, and then drink it through 2025.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Packed with apples, peaches and raspberries, this light-bodied wine was aged in large oak casks and is quite fruity without being at all sweet. It has very good balance, is thirst-quenching but not filling, and will pair well with a range of seafood, salads and lighter main dishes.",US-California-Gewürztraminer
"Hints of crushed mineral and struck steel lend a honed, linear feel to this dry, medium-bodied Riesling. It's a bit austere in style, but elegantly composed, with intense apple and pear flavors as well as a streak of lemon-lime on the finish.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Crisp and fruity, but also with some weight, this dense, textured wine has a very minerally character, with a straight line of tight acidity. This is complex and tense while also refreshing.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This spicy, fruity blend sources from seven different vineyards, and includes 5% portions of Cabernet Franc and Syrah. The acids bring up hints of pink grapefruit and orange, while the cherry and plum fruit flavors hold the center. The wine seems to thin out a bit through the finish.",US-Washington-Merlot
"The extreme youth of this stylishly packaged wine is on full display, with exuberant notes of crushed cranberry, raspberry, Earl Grey tea and rosewater on the nose. Lively acidity on the sip carries flavors of dried red fruit and touches of leather and tobacco. It's almost soda pop-like, and would go great with a slight chill on a warm day near the water.",US-California-Grenache
"Here's a cheerful Prosecco that doesn't offer much in the way of sophistication or complexity, nor does it pretend to. Its simple aromas include citrus, lemon soda and peach nectar. This wine is made by the Cantina Produttori di Valdobbiadene with organically grown grapes.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"Damo has earthy fragrances of tobacco leaf, underbrush and truffle, along with notes of raspberry and spice. The palate shows ripe black cherry, vanilla and sweet spice flavors, as well as a hint of licorice. This has nice depth and balance, but will be more complex after 2017.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"A soft, ripe wine with peach flavors, it has an attractively rich feel that is balanced by citrus and apple acidity. Very fruity, the wine is ready to drink.",France-Beaujolais-Chardonnay
"Golden in color, this is a creamy voluptuous white wine, fermented and aged entirely in new French oak. Melon, spicy nutmeg and fig build flavor around a core of thick texture and concentration, finishing in buttery toast.",US-California-Chardonnay
"An excellently priced blend of 70% Zinfandel, 14% Syrah, 11% Petite Sirah and 5% Grenache, this shows crystallized raspberry and rose petals on the nose. The palate offers light cranberry and pomegranate fruit, boosted by black and white pepper. This bottling has lots of life and energy, but it's drinking great now.",US-California-Red Blend
"Coming from Cerro Prieto Vineyard, one of the few places to grow Pinot Noir in this appellation, this bottling shows aromas of clove, vanilla, sandalwood and pomegranate on the nose. Light pomegranate and tart red-fruit flavors dominate the palate, with a touch of dried herb.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Soft in the mouth but high in alcohol, this Syrah tastes hot and peppery. The blackberry fruit flavors have a thick, jammy quality, and finish with a streak of mushrooms.",US-California-Syrah
"With the scent of watermelon chapstick leading the way, this is a fruit-forward wine you want to kiss. Other aromas on the sweet-and-spicy nose include stewed plums and a dill-led herbal element. The flavors of red fruits and brown spice make for a completely delicious experience.",US-California-G-S-M
"This opens with simple fruit tones of cherry and cassis backed by evolved aromas of spice, leather and cola. It shows impressive purity and a long, silky finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Smoky, oaky aromas of popcorn and buttered toast are louder than this bubbly's citrus and white-fruit scents. A bright, juicy, citrusy palate is full of pulse, while tangerine, orange and lemon flavors cut a direct path to a zesty finish showcasing white peach and nectarine flavors.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Green tannins mark this dry Pinot Noir, and the astringency accentuates the acidity, giving the wine a harsh mouthfeel. Although it has expressive cherry, pomegranate and cola flavors, it's a big disappointment, coming from this famous vineyard and block.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"From old vines planted on the sandy soils of Tejo, this is a fresh, while also concentrated wine. It has a sense of structure, with a nutmeg character along with the fresh yellow fruits. Touches of the wood-aging give an extra richness. Drink from 2016.",Portugal-Tejo-Fernão Pires
"The fine vineyard has yielded a tight Chardonnay, brisk in acidity and austere. The mineral-infused fruit flavors include oranges, apricots, limes and mangoes, along with buttery, toasty oak. There's plenty of elegance, but you want to drink the wine soon before the fruit fades away.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This value-minded wine is made in large quantities and maintains a classic edge of red berry and cedar, grippy on the palate, but able to open up in the glass. It'll serve well as a midweek house wine or staple for larger gatherings.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Subtle floral notes accent apple and lemon notes in this refreshing, mineral-focused wine. Off-dry in style, it has soft lemony acidity and a mouth filling, juicy feel that's unabashedly thirst quenching.",US-New York-Riesling
"This is yet another very good but not quite excellent Malbec from this winery. Solid berry aromas are edged by whiffs of green and horsehide. The palate is fresh, tight and a touch gritty in feel, with leathery red-berry flavors accented by earth and spice notes. This is solid and should be drunk now through 2015.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Here's a more serious Provence rosé, with a nice mineral streak and good depth of flavor. There's red berry fruit upfront that turns a bit confected in the mouth, winding down to a taffy note on the short-to-medium finish. Perfect with a meal of grilled fish.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This pretty expression of Pecorino opens with a fragrant bouquet of wild flower, stone fruit and sweet honey. The wine holds firmly to the palate thanks to the natural richness of this indigenous grape.",Italy-Central Italy-Pecorino
"Native Corvina and Croatina grapes are air-dried (the so-called passimento process) to create a distinctly concentrated and powerful red wine from the Verona area of northern Italy. The wine shows smooth, soft tannins and round fruit flavors.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Fig, black plum, dried cherry and chai spice show on the nose of this bottling from River Road south of Salinas. Heavy flavors of dried black cherry and dried cranberry show on the sip, lifted by eucalyptus oil, juniper and black-tea elements.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of peach pit, apricot and melon are basic but a little mealy. A chunky palate seems soft due to waning acidity. Flavors of melon and papaya finish slightly flat and bitter. Drink immediately.",Spain-Northern Spain-Rosado
"Creamy and delicious, this elegant off-dry sparkler doles out layers of sweet white peach, yellow apple, pear and a tangy note of candied lemon drop. A silky perlage gives it a smooth polished texture while bright acidity lifts the rich flavors.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Schug's regular Pinot, as opposed to their Heritage Reserve, is a dependably village-style expression of easy-drinking, cool-climate Pinot Noir. The '06, like previous vintages, shows a silky, delicate texture framing cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with a smoky vanilla edge of oak.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This overtly spicy wine is very intense, with a slight burn on the palate from the pepper flavor. Exotic white fruit and a hint of pomegranate are the flavors. It has a hard, final edge from its alcohol.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
This is a soft ripe wine that has yellow fruits alongside crisper red apples and touches of grapefruit. That makes for a balanced light wine that has a fine texture and a fresh aftertaste. Drink now.,Portugal-Península de Setúbal-Portuguese White
"This full-bodied offering is ripe and richly balanced. A predominance of the two Pinots gives it an intense fruitiness, with raspberry and red apple notes dominating. At the same time, there is a fine, mineral-driven tautness that gives it a final, crisp bite. Disgorged February 2012.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Neutral oak, 100% varietal. These three new releases from Cave B all taste of extremely young fruit, perhaps overcropped? In any event, without much going on. This is acidic, tastes like cranberry juice, with some volatility also.",US-Washington-Barbera
"A crisp bouquet of orange zest marks the opening of this wine, an unexpected twist to the narrative of dried cranberry, blackberry and cloves. On the palate, this full-bodied wine offers ample weight and richness, before a wealth of dry tannins feature on the finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Barolo Sorano (from the Serralunga d'Alba area) is an impressive wine with big color and extraction followed by aromas of cherry liqueur, spice, vanilla, clove and ginger. The wine is chewy and succulent in the mouth with firm tannins that will soften with time. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Combining finesse and structure, this impressive wine opens with alluring aromas of mature berry, pressed rose, aromatic herb, star anise, new leather and a balsamic note. The palate shows depth and tension, offering raspberry compote, Marasca cherry, licorice, clove and pipe tobacco alongside taut refined tannins. Hold for even more complexity. Drink 2019–2031.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This wine is closed and still very young. For the moment, acidity dominates, although plenty of ripe apples and peaches are waiting to come out. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Law enforcement veteran-turned-winemaker Cindy Cosco named this brand for her Italian roots, and presents violet, red cherry and pencil-lead aromas in this bottling. A wild-herb character powers the palate, with bay leaf most prominent, followed by tart elderberries and orange-peel sourness. The grippy palate will open more with age.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Initially this smells earthy and rubbery, but with airing it shows roasted dark-berry aromas mixed with horsey leather. The palate is full, tannic and scratchy, with black-fruit flavors, pepper, toast and herbal notes. Toast and coffee flavors are found on a hard, tannic finish. Tasted twice with mixed results.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Syrah
"Many of Oregon's best winemakers are scrambling to acquire Shea grapes. This small-scale producer does a fine job. Its Shea designate is a captivating wine loaded with blueberry, blue plum, black raspberry and a touch of violets. One-third new French oak brings a vein of chocolate. The balance is impeccable. Drink this with enjoyment immediately, or cellar it through 2025.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This offers subtle fruit characteristics, with scents of violet and rose in the background. A bright cherry flavor appears on the palate, where the wine delivers a syrupy, soft sweetness.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Pretty dark for a rosé, and heavy and rich, too. Tastes like a raspberry Newton cookie.",US-California-Rosé
"Sourced entirely from the Otis Harlan Vineyard, these vines were planted about 25 years ago. It's a pleasure to see them singled out for this showcase bottling. It's a rich, oily, nutty, buttery style to be sure, but also dense with ripe apple, pear and peach fruit. The acidity buoys it up throughout a strong, long finish.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"A simple Viognier. Shows the exotic richness of the variety, with tropical fruits, white flowers and peaches, as well as plenty of sweet oak. The finish is quick.",US-California-Viognier
"This crisp, clean Chardonnay offers aromas of apple, honey and tropical fruit, and the flavor profile is not terribly complex, but friendly. Fresh fruit is balanced by acid and the mouthfeel has an appeal creamy quality. Good for food pairing; think anything from lobster to spicy ethnic cuisine.",South Africa-Western Cape-Chardonnay
"While the wine is really pale in color, it does have a great range of flavors, offering red fruit notes balanced by beautiful acidity and citrus streaks. It's gently textured, giving a good bite to the fruitiness at the end.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This opens with pretty cherry fruit flavors, underscored with a touch of mineral and mocha. But there it ends, feeling one dimensional and fading fast in the finish. Three bottles tasted with similar results.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This wine is superfruity, gushing black-cherry syrup aromas and ripe concentrated cherry flavors backed by good acidity and very mild tannins. It emphasize the crisp zingy character that's inherent in the grape variety while being very full bodied.",US-California-Barbera
"The vineyard has championed Pinot Noir in this unlikely location in inland Mendocino County, and now De Loach successfully takes up the cause. Their '06 is gently soft, silky and dry, with deep flavors of cherries, currants, raspberries and chocolate, finished with a fine layer of oaky vanilla.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Creamy and bright, this Extra Dry Prosecco opens with soft notes of white flower and stone fruit. The wine shows a supple but lasting feel in the mouth with loads of fruity after flavors.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Herbal berry aromas shift to outright green, horsey and soapy. This has no mouthfeel to speak of, and it tastes weedy and a bit spoiled. A minty, green finish is no savior.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Attractive wine, hinting at the elegance of Chambolle, packed with strawberry-fruit flavors and sweet tannins. There is some final firmness, the acidity mingling with a solid structure.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Mainly Grenache, this is a full, rich, velvety Rhône blend. Toasty oak, vanilla and baking spices dominate the youthful aromas, backed by black cherry fruit on the palate. It's warm and plush on the finish. Drink now–2025.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Bursts with bright, linear cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors, but it's not caustic, sharp or grating. Acidity at peak power yields a zesty, racy personality while a blanket of vanilla flavor softens the cherry and raspberry fruit. Crisp and a good food wine.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Clean, snappy aromas of apple and citrus are sharp but appealing. This fresh, healthy white offers tangerine, nectarine and stony flavors before a crisp, refreshing finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-White Blend
"Another good bubbly from Sonim, this red-colored sparkler is dry on the nose, with cherry and cassis aromas. It feels round and full as it shows off bright raspberry and plum flavors in front of a healthy, smooth finish. Much darker in color than most rosé Cavas.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"This is a heavy, bitterly tannic young wine that shows ripe blackberry and coffee flavors and spices. The raw astringency makes it tough now, fit only for greasy foods like barbecued ribs. It should age well for a long time, but will never quite overcome its rustic profile.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Though still very young, this bottling is already compelling. Black currant, black plum, fig, rosemary and game aromas arise on the concentrated nose. The layered palate offers fennel, cracked rainbow peppercorn, black currant jam and hoisin sauce flavors, cut by a vibrant acidity that penetrates into the finish.",US-California-Syrah
"Still-subdued fruit signals that this needs time. The palate is tight and elegant, but riches of tart cherry fruit rest just beneath the surface and wait to emerge fully. There is acidic verve and velvety structure; nothing is overdone and it's very balanced. This fresh little number needs time to blossom.",Austria-Leithaberg-Blaufränkisch
"This fresh, crisp wine has layers of lemon over a lively mousse. It offers a mineral texture allied to great fruitiness and youthful acidity. Drink now, although this bottling will benefit from further aging.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"A touch of funky yeastiness plays on the nose before the lemon zestiness shines through. The palate is slender and light, focusing on that bright, fresh lemon note. This is easy, juicy and very refreshing.",Austria-Kremstal-Riesling
"This wine kicks off with awesome aromatics of jasmine flowers, white beach, green tea and Rainier cherry. The palate is clean and crisp with ripe honeydew melon, Gala apple and Anjou pear flavors that are pleasant but simple.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is made in a rich style, so the aroma is handsomely oaky, like buttered toast, the flavors are as rich as pear syrup and vanilla bean, the texture and body are full and the finish lingers. Fans of unoaked Chardonnay need not apply.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a rare premier release from the winery's new vineyard. It's a blend of different clones, and only 47 cases were produced. The wine is very exotic. It shows tiers of raspberries and cherries, but also more feral notes, of dried meats or leather, mushrooms, tart balsam, tangy minerals and scads of dusty, sweet Indian spices. Tannic and dry, it should unfold slowly over the next 10 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Made with 65% Nebbiolo, 20% Vespolina and 15% Uva Rara, this polished red from Piedmont offers aromas and flavors of dried red cherry, clove, baking spice and rust. It's well balanced, with silky tannins and fresh acidity while a graphite note closes the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Red Blend
"Where Girard's estate Cab is beautiful now, their Diamond Mountain bottling is one for the cellar. Veteran winemaker Marco DiGiulio has applied his considerable experience, with classic results. The wine is marked by firm tannins that make it astringent and sticky. But underneath all that is an explosion of currant, plum, licorice, chocolate and spicy curry flavor that dazzles. Should easily age for a long time in a proper cellar. Production was a paltry 325 cases, and worth the search.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"From nose to palate, smoke and dusty mineral notes extend a savory, regal tone to this dry, full-bodied Riesling. It's richly textured, almost oily, on the palate, but refreshed by spine-tingling streaks of pineapple, lemon and tangerine flavors. The finish is long and penetrating. Drink now through 2020.",Germany-Rheinhessen-Riesling
"This ripe blend of four grapes was aged in wood for nine months. Filled by rich blackberry fruits, the generous texture is cut by acidity. Drink this smooth wine now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"With fine tannins, ripe berry fruits and a good cut of acidity, this is an attractive wine that deserves some aging. It has weight along with its strawberry and red currant flavors. Drink from 2016. Made by UNIVITIS Producers.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Made with native grape Zibibbo, this offers aromas and flavors of rose petal, peach, orange zest and a hint of sage. Refreshing acidity brightens the savory palate while a touch of sea salt signals the close.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Zibibbo
"Enticing and earthy, this opens with compelling aromas of truffle, tobacco, black-skinned fruit, menthol and a whiff of blue flower. The palate is both structured and elegant, delivering dried morello cherry, prune and pipe tobacco framed in taut fine-grained tannins that give it a firm velvety texture. It's still tightly wound and needs time. Drink 2022–2032.",Italy-Central Italy-Sagrantino
"The bottle looks like it's wrapped in leopard fur. The wine is off-dry, clean and simple, with crisp flavors of raspberries, strawberries, honey and vanilla.",US-California-Sparkling Blend

Feels rich, grabby and tastes resiny on the finish, but there's enough solid black fruit to override the oak.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Black fruits, earth notes and a hint of toast create a subtle, inviting nose. In the mouth, this is chunky but balanced, with mild tannins. Cassis and plum are the lead flavors, and the finish is mellow and fleshy in feel, with a certain lazy ease to it.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"A light, crisp style that hints at spice but shows delicious fresh fruit. The acidity shows through, giving a vibrant character to the fruit.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"With dense tannins and already generous and opulent fruit, this wine has great structure plus fine black-currant fruit and acidity. Its perfumes are balanced, with an elegant character. It should be ready to drink from 2026.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Plum, raspberry, dried herb and light spice aromas lead to a choppy but solid palate. Oaky flavors of toast and coffee sit atop blackberry fruit, while this finishes with richness and dominating barrel-driven flavors of spice and toast.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley-Carmenère
"Touches of toast and tannin give enough structure. The red berry fruits taste firm and extracted, giving a bitter edge. It's a wine that brings out the structured character of Pinot Noir rather than its fruit.",France-Loire Valley-Pinot Noir
"This is bright and smooth, with forward berry fruit and just the right amount of chocolaty oak. Supple and tangy, with a lip-smacking finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Bright and perfumed while also rich, this is a full-bodied wine. It has spice and pepper that come from its alcohol although everything is kept fresh by the red-currant fruitiness. Drink now.",France-Provence-Rosé
"There's a nice aspect of polished tannin behind this vineyard-designate that gives it a refined sensibility, and a roundness of ripeness that becomes almost overwhelming. An aroma of crayon plays with sturdier elements of baked bread and blackberry jam for a concentrated, full-bodied finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Black as they come, with saturated, jammy aromas of sweet berry fruit, blackberry syrup and toasty oak. The palate is lush and chewy, with black fruit, spice and herbal flavors. Toasty and black on the finish. A big wine with plentiful oak as well as purity.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Once again Winderlea's outstanding Chardonnay is a blend of grapes sourced from Carabella, Hyland and Thistle. Immaculate winemaking builds a full-bodied wine, lushly flavored with apples, peaches and citrus. The concentrated midpalate is framed with skin flavors and toasty oak, lightly applied.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay

"On the nose, layers range from fragrant and floral jasmine to mango sorbet, and ripe nectarine to oven-fresh croissants. The mouthfeel is creamy, with stone fruit and banana flavors. Zingy acidity powers a long finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This firmly structured wine is packed with solid tannins as well as ripe juicy red fruits. It comes from the upper part of the Rugiens Premier Cru, one of the top sites in Pommard. Dense and needing to age, the wine will be ready from 2023.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This young, fruity wine from Vignobles Lesgourgues has great potential. Along with its bright red and blackberry fruits, it has succulent acidity and touches of wood aging that have smoothed the fruity character. It needs to age longer, so keep until 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Charred oak, licorice, herbal blackberry and gamy notes make for a full array of aromas. This is big and tannic, but with a sense of fresh fruit. Plum and cassis are the core flavor components, while the finish is fleshy and not overly demanding. Drink through 2021.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"This is a wine that is full of red fruits and fresh acidity. The tannic structure is well in balance giving a firm edge to the bright, ready-to-drink fruits. The wine is the entry level to the always impressive range from Crasto. Drink this wine now.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Made in a style to appeal to today's Chardonnay fans, this has flavors of buttered toast, popcorn, vanilla, pineapple and Key lime pie, with crisp acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Cerviolo is a blend that builds in intensity on the palate, offering excellent extraction and a distinctive mix of Christmas spice followed by dry flowers and red fruit. This wine has loads of personality, jackhammer tannins and natural licorice and spice nuances on the finish. But those tannins definitely need more time to relax, so drink after 2012.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This smoky wine is ripe with a fine balance between tannins and rich red fruits. It is warm, rounded and attractively spicy. The structure and dry core will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2022.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"A blend of half and half Chardonnay and Aligoté, this is a mineral textured wine that is shot through with acidity and green fruits. It is crisp, light and bright, and refreshingly ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Sparkling Blend
"A bombastic blend of 44% Syrah, 19% Grenache, 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Mourvèdre and 9% Petite Sirah, this wine offers blueberry ice cream, chocolate-chip cookies, crushed berries and hot gingerbread on the luxurious nose. The palate packs a similarly vast array of flavors that range from tobacco and dried mint to pine forest and pencil shavings, as well as black currant, black loam and baking spice.",US-California-Red Blend
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah, this shows savory spice, smoked meat and tobacco notes, followed by black-berry, dark cherry and cola. The palate is fresh and clean, but it has enough heft to be paired with grilled meat.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Another fine effort in a continuing series of outstanding PGs from Hogue. This is tart and stylish, loaded with citrus and bracingly acidic. Flavors meld lemon, lime, lemon verbena, orange peel and a slice of pear.",US-Washington-Pinot Grigio
"There's a hint of ripe fruit here that recalls strawberry or raspberry. The palate is clean, round and soft, and the finish lacks the burnt almond note this grape sometimes offers.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"A reserved, interesting bouquet of pine and black fruits isn't overdone or overly oaky. In the mouth, this Cab is powerful and muscular, with a creamy, rich texture. Flavorwise, it's heady and creamy, with blackberry fruit and peppery spice on the finish. Drink through 2017.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"You get decent value and plenty of intensity in this 90-10 Sangiovese-Cab blend. The wine offers bright tones of fruit and toasted nut, while the mouthfeel is simple and a bit thorny.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"There is only the faintest of aromas on this soft, lightly juicy wine. It is a warm-climate wine, rounded, soft and gentle. The freshness comes at the end, bright and with a citrus touch.",France-France Other-Sauvignon Blanc
"La Mano smells dry and spicy, with modest but present oak aromas and vanilla-tinged plum and berry scents. It's angular in feel, but the flavors of oak-based black fruit and raspberry work. It finishes mild, with some oaky residue.",Spain-Northern Spain-Mencía
"Dense and rich, this is a hearty dry red for near-term drinking. Black olive and espresso aromas give way to chocolate and dark berries on the palate, while the finish is velvety and warm.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"You can't beat this price for a Pinot Grigio with natural freshness and pristine aromas of stone fruit and citrus. The nice thing is that it tastes Italian made, and not like many of the commercial, generic Grigios on the market today.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"This rosé brings extra levels of finesse and detail along with the expected burst of fresh fruit. Elegant and sophisticated, it offers tart cherry fruit, some peppery herb and a hint of fresh-ground coffee. Barrel fermented in neutral oak, it's smooth as silk.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A gorgeous, single-vineyard Chenin Blanc that shows great complexity and balance. The bouquet is initially seductive and oaky, but it subsides with time to integrate with the ripe melon, mango and yellow peach scents. Developed and slightly honeyed, the palate is lush and round. Almond, honeysuckle and soft sweet spice flavors stay through the long close. Tasty now, but should age nicely through 2015.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Chenin Blanc
"Sourced from seven separate vineyard sites, this is a full-bodied, rich and concentrated white, given 15 months in 40% new French oak. The barrel comes through in supportive ways, complementing the freshness of apple and lemon spiked in acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A rich, oak-laden wine that shows fine ripe fruits. There are juicy blackberry and dried fruit flavors allied to a light structure that results in a rich, open and generous wine.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Considerable toasted wood flavors show from both the aroma and the initial taste. The fruit is lean, without the weight needed for balance. It's likely to remain an austere wine.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"From the successful 2004 vintage, this beautifully evolved Barolo is just about ready to drink. The tannins show a fine, silky quality and the bouquet offers tones of plump black fruit, root beer and powdered licorice.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Aromas of leather, graphite, saucy berry and tomato are good but not necessarily inviting. This high-elevation Cabernet is bouncy in feel and solid in structure. Flavors of briny berry fruits come with oaky notes of vanilla and caramel, while the finish is chocolaty but quickly loses its fruit character.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Comes out of the chute a bit tarry and rubbery, but seems to come around with some time in the glass, offering a lush, dense texture and flavors of coffee and black olive that finally show some berry shadings on the finish.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Oliverhill seems to have hit the mark in 2008 with their Jimmy Section Shiraz, a seamless blend of blueberries and cream dressed up with savory notes of dark earth and dark coffee. Full-bodied and creamy textured, this densely concentrated wine should be at its best now-2020.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Winemaker Matt Dicey has teased out Pinot Noir's silky texture and ample complexity in this wine, one of his finest to date. Cherry fruit hints at rose petals and picks up subtle earth and spice shadings on the palate, finishing with elegance and class. Drink now–2012, although its balance may permit it to hold for several more years after that.",New Zealand-Central Otago-Pinot Noir
Apricot and savory herb aromas lead the nose on this sophisticated white. The palate shows a core of concentrated yellow peach and pear accented with a light note of fennel. Fresh acidity adds brightness and makes for a pristine finish.,Italy-Central Italy-White Blend

"This ripe Saint-Émilion is generous with its rounded perfumed Merlot. It gives the wine richness, juicy acidity and an open texture. Touches of tannin do bring in some structure, but the emphasis is on the fruitiness and fresh aftertaste. Drink from late 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Only 100 cases of this vintage-designated oloroso were made, and now it smells mature, nutty and oily. A full, elegant palate shows the right weight and acidic cut, while salty flavors of peanut and caramel finish long, nutty and a touch hot due to 22% abv.",Spain-Andalucia-Sherry
"Tight, rooty, spicy aromas of cherry and cassis include notes of raw minerals and crushed rocks. This is a bit gritty and tannic, but it's not fierce or unyielding. Reedy, spicy plum, berry, coffee and cocoa flavors finish dry, with lasting notes of chocolate and baking spices. Drink through 2021.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The nose unfolds shyly, revealing black-skinned fruit and baking spice aromas. The palate evokes mature flavors like dried blackberry, tobacco and toast, held together by close-grained tannins. It's rather evolved so drink soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Simple and fruity, this has crisp apple and grapefruit flavors. It is light and refreshing and is ready to drink over the next few months.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This is a big, chocolate and dense fruit flavored wine. It shows strong signs of extraction, giving a bitter character along with licorice flavors. That's balanced by the great weight of fruit, solid fruit tannins and rich smoky flavors. Drink this powerful wine from 2018.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Doesn't taste quite ripe, with very dry, herbal flavors and also a strong hit of acidity. Almost suggests wintergreen sour candy, although there's some decent cherry and cola, accented, of course, by oak. Awkward, but could just be young. Hard to tell.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of blackberry, plum, chocolate and spice are light, but the palate is fruit-filled and flavorful with a tart finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lightly stalky because it is still young, this wine otherwise promises rich black-currant fruitiness as it matures. It is balanced, ripe and with a gentle set of tannins in the background. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Green, lightly vegetal aromas of pole beans and canned peas lead to a palate with moderate acidity and pop. A briny mix of citrus and vegetal flavors carries over to the finish.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This offers notes of white strawberry, cherry and melon rind on the nose and mouth. Medium-minus in weight, flavors of lime peel and tart cherry skin lend astringent grip to the close.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rosé
"This was a difficult vintage, and the wine reflects it. It feels off-balance, with astringent, chalky tannins, and lean, simple fruit.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Monastrell-Cabernet blend is ripe and syrupy. The palate is so saturated that it verges on being overdone. Flavors of blackberry and cassis syrup finish heavy, sweet and sticky.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"Charbono is an old variety in Napa Valley, now rarely grown. This wine is bitterly tannic, yet the blackberry, cherry and mocha fruit is so strong, it breaks through the astringency, making the wine drinkable now. But it will age for at least a decade, maybe two. Try as an interesting alternative to Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot.",US-California-Charbono
"Pear and spring flower aromas lead the way on this vibrant white. The bright palate offers yellow apple, candied lemon zest and a touch of mineral alongside fresh acidity that leaves a clean finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio

"Elegant and structured, this opens with exquisite scents of cedar, chopped herb, pressed rose, menthol and perfumed berry. The luminous palate is loaded with finesse, delivering bright red cherry, chopped red raspberry, licorice, clove and mineral.

"This light refreshing wine spent 16 months in 20% new French oak. The pretty berry fruit is elegantly set in complementary acids, with a streak of blond tea threading through the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"The wine is tight, green and herbal. It has some fruitiness, but that is suppressed by general underripeness. The tannins are hard at the end.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Sagebrush aromas lead off this bottling from the newish Fossil Point label, which is connected to the higher end Center of Effort brand. On the palate, spice, tar and pomegranate accompany some fairly weighty tannins, meaning that this will probably emerge as a better wine by 2016.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of licorice, underbrush, scorched earth and a balsamic whiff of menthol develop in the glass. Firm but elegant, the structured palate offers dried Marasca cherry, spicy blackberry and ground clove set against taut close-grained tannins. Drink 2020–2028.",Italy-Central Italy-Sagrantino
"Caramel and white-chocolate aromas lead to very ripe, buttery flavors, a sense of sweetness and an almost thick texture in this full-bodied wine. Practically as rich and creamy as a milkshake, it will delight some drinkers for its unctuousness.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Lively and crisp, this wine offers a pure line of citrus fruit. Its acidity and herbal edge are right up front, refreshing and aromatic. The wine is ready to drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Simple, straightforward and approachable, this fairly priced wine shows a depth of red currant, cherry and cassis alongside moderate acidity and subtle oak. It should please fans of lightly styled yet bold reds.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Previously labeled as Les Gourmandises, this is now The Long Run in honor of Scott Wright's completing his first full-length marathon in 2011. It's all Nysa vineyard fruit, graceful and delicate, scented with rose water and satin smooth. Cranberry and wild strawberry fruit accents lead into a mouthful of cherry soda, delicate but lingering.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Fleshy, generous black cherry fruit swishes across nose and palate. A core of freshness and spice brings a little order into all this fleshiness. This may benefit from being chilled as a full-fruited if medium-bodied summer red.",Austria-Burgenland-Blaufränkisch
"Well done Shiraz, carefully made and judiciously oaked, with vanilla and cedar accenting blackberry, plum and black olive flavors. It's moderately tannic on the finish, where it adds some coffee-like nuances as well. Drink 2010–2018.",Australia-Victoria-Shiraz
"This is a richly structured and deliciously juicy wine. The tannins are fully integrated into the fruit. The downside of the wine is a touch of greenness, particularly in the acidity.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Beautifully fragrant and breezy with summer aromas of white flower, green herb and exotic fruit, here is the perfect summer sipping wine. Pair this Sauvignon with spaghetti with vongole and freshly chopped parsley.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"An ambitious wine, obviously grown from low yielding vines whose fruity flavors have been concentrated into wild blackberries and cherries, finished with the exotic spices that characterize Dry Creek Zinfandel. A very good Zin for the price.",US-California-Zinfandel
"For the vintage, this is an austere style of wine, emphasising tannins over fruit. The fruit is certainly rich, and the tannins are dusty rather than dry, but it is a wine which is developing more slowly, suggesting it is also a wine for long-term aging.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Dry and soft, this is a little earthy, so if you're expecting a big, rich wine this might not be for you. It has dried herb, grilled pineapple and smoky oak flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Sometimes a Sauvignon Blanc this dry, acidic and low in alcohol can be unbalanced, but this one hits it out of the park. With tastes of citrus zest, white peach, green apple and spice, it's just a beautiful apèritif wine, and also is ideal supporting roast chicken, bruschetta with chèvre, and grilled veggies.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This lush wine, green/gold in hue, offers mouth-coating flavors with richness and style. Apple, pear and papaya fruit holds down the center, with elements of toasted hazelnuts and butter pecan from aging in 20% new French oak. The creamy, smooth finish is delightful.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Smells neither tropical nor citric as it falls somewhere in the middle of those two common denominators. Feels wet, fresh and minerally, with flavors of lime, green melon, sour apple, green herbs and mineral. Clean, well-cut and tight on the finish, with zesty length.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a very pretty wine, though not nearly as substantial as the 2009. Fruit flavors of strawberry and light cherry are set over tart acids. The palate softens up a bit and runs through a quick, clean fade.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"The wine is balanced, full both of dried fruits and old wood and spice flavors. It is a rich wine, smoothly textured and with an attractive bite of acidity and brandy spirit at the end.",Portugal-Port-Port
"This soft, jammy and fruity wine is ready to drink, with black-currant flavors that are ripe and rounded. Only the lightest tannins gives any structure to this wine that is immediately accessible.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This powerful wine reveals its style and breeding from the start. It has weight and concentration allied to great tangy fruit flavors. The nervy edge is very evident, with wood, structure from green apple skins and aging potential.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Dark blackberry, riverstone, and crushed gravel notes make for a lively cool-climate Grenache grown in the heart of the appellation. The palate is very dry, tautly woven and elegant, with savory beef, thyme, rosemary and purple flower flavors all perfectly integrated.",US-California-Grenache
"The vineyard is south of the city of Napa, in a cool area, and the Merlot is traditionally ripe, dry and hard in tannins. The 2005 follows that formula. The new oak has not yet been integrated, and the wine is fresh, young and a little brash right now. But the tremendous heart of cherry, blackberry, chocolate and plum fruit suggests ageability.",US-California-Merlot
"This is a wood-aged wine with spice and vanilla flavors, fine berry fruits and a rich texture. It is firm, while also rich and generous. The weight, the ripeness and the structure all promise aging. Drink from 2015.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is big and yellowish in color, which is usually an indicator of strong barrel character. And indeed, it's very oaky and resiny on the nose, palate and finish. But in between the waves of wood spice, vanilla and resin are complexities, fine acidity, good textural balance and sweet, tropical fruit flavors. Drink now.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"This is a fine, ageable Pinot Noir that's dry and crisp with acidity. It exhibits a mushroomy earthiness that frames strawberry, cranberry and cola flavors. The window of drinkability begins in 2015.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"With its rich toasty aroma and ripe creamed apple palate, this is a rich Champagne reflecting the vintage. It is well balanced, with toffee softness and lime juice acidity. Not for aging, but currently very enjoyable.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Fresh green pear and hints of ivy on nose and palate create a light-bodied, friendly, easy-drinking summer white. Zippiness and fruitiness are the hallmarks. Drink as soon as possible while fruit flavors are at their peak.",Austria-Weinviertel-Grüner Veltliner
"Lush berry and marzipan aromas are darkened up by toast and graphite notes. This is a major-league specimen from Bierzo with a full body and manageable tannins. Blackberry, baking spice, mocha and dark-roast-coffee flavors hold steady on the finish before hollowing out. Drink through 2024.",Spain-Northern Spain-Mencía
"Milky chocolate and creamy almond paste open the nose of this ripe and rich Barolo. Shadings of citrus, spice, plum, licorice and root beer add to the complexity. This is a pure, elegant and traditional expression of Nebbiolo that needs another five to 10 years in the cellar.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Ripe blueberry fruit meets vanilla, cola and thyme touches on the approachable nose of this wine from Steve Gerbac. There's a well-balanced array of flavors on the dynamic palate, from potpourri spice to blackberry and blueberry fruit.",US-California-Syrah
"The aromas on this bottling are inoffensive but a bit flat, with broad nectarine and light orange touches. There is a citrus twist to the palate and a touch of wet cement.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"California's best Riesling grown for 25 years at 1,800 feet above Napa Valley. Crisp and concentrated flavors of apples, lime and minerals are encased in fine acidity and drink steely and sleek. The residual sugar us 0.7%, which is off-dry, but the acids are so good, the wine feels dry in the mouth. By the way, this wine will age for a long time.",US-California-Riesling
"In this concentrated wine, an opulent botrytis character dominates. Notes of yellow and citrus fruits combine with a lemon-flavored honey accent to produce a wine that has both richness and intense acidity. It needs to age.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Niner's Paso Robles Bordeaux-style reds have attracted attention. Now the winery turns to Pinot Noir, but they wisely turn to the cooler Edna Valley. The resulting wine is dry, silky and crisp in acidity, with pleasant raspberry and sandalwood flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Are golfer-inspired wines the next big thing? First came Greg Norman, then Ernie Els, now there's Nick Faldo. Made by Katnook Estate, this is a dark, plushly textured wine that's immediately accessible. Cassis and plum fruit is framed by dark accents of coffee and cola, picking up hints of mint on the finish. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A bit stalky on the nose, with tropical aromas and lychee. The palate is a little broken down and heavy, with flat citrus and lychee flavors. Finishes wan, with dried apricot notes.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Torrontés
"This red sources from across three appellations and four varieties, all aged in a mix of French and American oak for one year. That oak imparts a smoky element around thick, concentrated baked fruit and big, lasting tannin weight, showing plenty of leathery tobacco.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The 2007 vintage splits down the middle in Oregon; some producers managed it well; others seemed to struggle. This Jamsheed is a pale reflection of the winery's 2006; thin with herb and leaf, stem and sour fruits.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Smoky and intense from the get-go, this saturated, black-as-night Malbec is full of blackberry, cassis and gamy aromas. While it goes heavy on the gas, the wine's structure is up to it. Flavors of chocolate, burnt toast, salt and blackberry finish toasty and long, with savory blackened spice notes. Drink through 2023.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Ripe dark berry, sweet cake spice and pipe tobacco are just some of the aromas you'll find on this stunning wine. The palate shows structure and finesse, doling out black cherry, raspberry, black pepper, clove and anise alongside firm, velvety tannins and bright acidity.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Corte San Benedetto is a small, family run winery and its 2003 Amarone shows ripe notes of black cherry, mesquite, blackberry and soft vanilla. The oak element is evident here; the wine is soft and supple on the close.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Regent, this garnet-colored wine has aromas of cherry vanilla, eucalyptus and tobacco leaf. Flavors of mocha and blackberry lead to a balanced finish.",Bulgaria-Thracian Valley-Red Blend

"Here's a carefully aged expression of Montepulciano from Abruzzo that offers sultry aromas of spice, currant and dried raspberry, along with notes of leather, tobacco and smoke. It finishes with dry, polished sensations of wet river stone and root beer. Drink now.",Italy-Central Italy-Montepulciano
"It seems as if this pure Sangiovese was left to hang as long as possible, and it's got extra color and power. The fruit flavors are edging into a pruney character, with some noticeable heat in the finish.",US-Washington-Sangiovese
"Deep color and complex aromas like dark chocolate and cedar lead to ripe, concentrated and tastefully dry berry and cherry flavors in this Rhône-style blend. The mouthfeel is firm with tannins but polished.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend

"Amazingly delicious and soft. Defines the modern Napa Cabernet style, with the tasteful elegance Hall wines are known for. With 20% Merlot, it displays dazzlingly rich flavors of blackberries, black cherries, red currants and mocha, with a savory note of bacon. Now–2013.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A simple Chardonnay, it has strong acidity and equally strong vanilla, peach and orange flavors. There's even a hint of buttercream.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Once the first whiff of yeast has worn off, a very pure, linear procession of citrus flavors presents itself: from the yellowish green of grapefruit to the greenish orange of a tangy tangerine, always with a deeper, more resonant core of earth and stone. The zestiness glistens on the surface, the tightly closed, still earthy fruit broods at the core. Wait for it to explode. Drink 2018–2028.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"Apple and spice give this wine a bright as well as subtle character. Citrus acidity combines with a tangy, zesty texture. It still needs to age, so drink from 2015.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"Baked plum, exotic spice, forest floor, pressed violet and balsamic aromas lead the way. The big juicy palate offers fleshy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, mocha and vanilla while velvety tannins provide both support and finesse. Thanks to the succulent fruit, you won't detect the hefty alcohol. Drink 2018–2026.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Opaque purple and thick in the glass, this wine has inky, supercharged aromas of ripe blackberry and spice. It feels amped up but balanced, with more intensity and clarity than what most other $18 reds offer.

"If there is one quality that distinguishes the wines of the late Giuseppe Quintarelli, it is complexity. Unlike any other producer in the Amarone production area, this legendary artisan magically pulls out aromas of dried sage, Indian spice, crushed white pepper and delicate forest berry. On the palate, the wine is bright, crisp and intense, but never heavy or syrupy. Italy lost one of its greatest winemakers when Quintarelli passed away in early 2012.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Here's a beautiful interpretation from the 2008 vintage that shows balance, harmony and intensity all zipped up into one tight package.

Hold 5–10 years.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Dry and smoothly tannic, this wine is packed with complex blackberry-pie, currant, anise, herb and cedar flavors. This is nearly as good as the winery's more costly Walking Tree Vineyard Block Collection Cabernet, but it's just a little less concentrated.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Merlot has long been Waterbrook's strong suit, and this offers the expected seamless blend of cherry/berry fruit, softly polished tannins and toasty barrel flavors. What are missing—at least for the moment—are the grace notes. Give it plenty of breathing time and you begin to detect traces of spice and earth, finishing with a lick of chocolate.",US-Washington-Merlot
"The beautifully judged pale-orange-pink color of this delicious wine is a sign of the balance in the glass. It is crisp and towards the dry end of Brut, typical of the Lanson style. There is fine acidity and a crisp texture from the Chardonnay in the blend. Hints of red fruits come through along with a touch of tannin. The wine is ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"The style of this young wine is for ripe fruit as well as really crisp acidity. Bright lemon flavors are combined with yellow fruits and only the slightest hint of herbaceousness. This is already well balanced, although it will be even better from the end of 2015.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Fruity and herbal in flavor and generous in texture, this is medium to full bodied and quite smooth in mouth feel. It smells like currants, black olives and dried herbs, and tastes a bit savory and complex along with the plummy fruit flavors.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a dry, structured wine, with dry tannins and stalky fruit characteristics. However, it will develop into a fruity wine without great depth but with attractive berry flavors and acidity. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Crisp red plums and sour cherries add a tart fruit character to this sheer Finger Lakes Pinot Noir. Brisk on the palate with a good dose of bramble in the midpalate, it finishes clean on a minty, herbaceous note.",US-New York-Pinot Noir
"Fruity and crisp, this is a ripe, refreshing wine. Lively acidity sets off the full strawberry and red-currant fruits. The aftertaste continues the fruity theme with tangy orange-zest flavors.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Delicate scents of honeydew melon, orchard fruit and a whisper of white spring flower lift from the glass. The savory palate offers white peach, green apple, sage and a hint of toasted almond alongside bright acidity. A light mineral note signals the close.",Italy-Piedmont-Cortese
"A full-bodied yet remarkably fresh Gigondas, with floral aromas and a fruit-driven style. Subtle shadings of licorice and chocolate add dark overtones, while the tannins are finely textured on the long finish. Drink now–2018.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"The wine has power, structure and density. Hard initial tannins show that it needs to age, but the black fruits come through richly as it opens up. The strong mineral character gives a firm texture to the wine. Drink from 2017.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Mille e Una Notte is a modern, thickly extracted Nero d'Avola-based red wine with elegant tones of blackberry, plum, spice, vanilla and clove. Its long finish ends with chewy tannins and excellent succulence. Donnafugata recently completed an ambitious Bordeaux-style underground cellar (among the biggest in southern Italy) for aging this showcase wine.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"Great price for a super-drinkable Sauvignon Blanc. Brilliantly crisp and mouthwateringly clean, it delivers bone-dry flavors of lemons, limes and grapefruits, with a wildflowery spiciness.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This rich and generous expression of Vermentino shows aromas of honey, dried hay, stone fruit and white almond. The dense, creamy palate would stand up to spicy Thai coconut curry.",Italy-Tuscany-Vermentino
"An attractive, pale-colored rosé, this offers crisp acidity and bright red currant and raspberry fruitiness. The wine is balanced with delicate fruits, a touch of minerality and a fresh aftertaste. It is ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This is the flagship Chardonnay from Thomas Fogarty Winery, a one-barrel lot that comes from a third-acre vineyard. And yet, from the winery's excellent 2011 line-up, it brings the least to the table. A zesty, grassy lemon-lime soda nose lands on the palate with Key lime and very little complication, making it pleasurable, but fairly breezy for the headiest of the Fogarty lot. Pair with halibut or seared scallops.",US-California-Chardonnay
"There's a pure almond note here of Amaretto, marzipan and almond milk. In fact, there's not much else except for distant notes of white flower and peach. The mouthfeel is tonic and fresh but thin.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"This wine doesn't reveal much age at all, with fresh golden pear and tangerine rind aromas punched up with a hint of sour yeast. The yeast dominates the palate, though orange and rounded melon tones add to the full experience.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Light bodied and fruit-driven, this wine leads with refreshing, easy citrus notes and friendly red apple nuances. It finishes dry.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Rosé
"Shows good flavors, with plenty of cherries and blackberries and a touch of herbs, and the finish is nice and dry. The all-important mouthfeel is a little irregular, though, with green tannins and a bite of acidity. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Trebbiano is fermented in concrete tanks with no selected yeasts. The nose isn't very expressive but the palate shows restrained notes of golden apple, lemon drop and flint. This is already evolved and starting to fade so enjoy soon.",Italy-Central Italy-Trebbiano
"The wine is fruity, crisp and herbaceous. Everything is in place for an attractive, ready-to-drink wine, all fruit and with only a light texture.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Laser strikes of acidity and deep, mineral intensitiy lend a grounded elegance to this otherwise sunny, yielding dessert wine. It's intensely honeyed, bursting with sweet pineapple and peach flavors, yet finely filigreed in mouthfeel. Delicious already, it should improve through 2040.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Aromatic and silky upon entry, this stylish Syrah brings dark berry fruit flavors laced with toast and smoked meats. It's saturated, bright and sappy, with fine grained tannins that seem to spread the flavors fully across the palate. The finish is of medium length, expanding gradually as the wine airs, and adding vanilla and chocolate flavors.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Spicy, ripe and fruity, this wine has enough structure to give shape to the broad black fruits that are the stars. A smoky element comes from just the right amount of wood aging. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Beautiful black-cherry aromas and flavors make this wine direct and focused. A slightly gripping texture of fine-grained tannins and good acidity keeps the mouthfeel lively. It has a wonderful sense of purity and focus.,US-California-Zinfandel
"Simple and fruity, with jammy blackberry, cherry, cola and toffee flavors wrapped into smooth tannins. Comes from the warmer Happy Canyon region.",US-California-Syrah
"Strongly flavored, this Chardonnay marches to its own beat. Some will object to the apricot, golden currant and butterscotch tastes as atypical, but they're quite complex and original. It finishes thoroughly dry and crisp. Drink over the next 3–4 years.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This was barrel fermented, and picked up a fair amount of oaky flavor as a result. The barrels overtake the light apple fruit, at least for now, but consider this as a fine, inexpensive alternative to Chardonnay.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Some awkward flavors and textures in this dry, tannic wine. Polished blackberries and cherries co-exist beside less ripe mint, and the tannins and acids are sharp and green. Seems like problems at the sorting table.",US-California-Red Blend
"This Petite Sirah-led blend, which also features 24% Syrah, 9% Grenache and 1% Viognier, offers deep violet aromas alongside pine, tarragon and sea salt caramel. There's a strong molasses and pancakes-with-fruity-syrup character on the palate and very soft mouthfeel. Definitely a dessert sipper.",US-California-Red Blend
"A fine Cabernet, one of the best from Sonoma Valley. It's dry and firm in tannins, with complex black cherry, licorice, mocha and cedar flavors. A little softer and broader than a comparably-priced Napa Cab, it's no less ageworthy. Drink now–2020.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"For what is essentially a second wine, generally blended from the estate's younger vines, this is a solid effort in a not-so-easy vintage. Vanilla and cinnamon from barrel-aging play a role hedre, but there's also plenty of juicy, plum-tinged fruit. There's ample body and texture, capped off by supple tannins and a lingering finish. Drink now–2022.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"From 100% grand cru Chardonnay vineyards in the Côte des Blancs, this is a rich but almost bone-dry wine. It has a great mineral character that offers freshness, apple skins and a flinty edge. The disgorgement date is indicated on the bottle. Impressive, this would benefit from six months' aging.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"Earth, leather and herbal aromas blend with riper berry notes on the nose. This feels choppy, with cheek-scraping tannins. Flavors of minty herbal black fruits finish with chocolate, herbal flavors and stickiness.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
Juicy red fruit dominates this wine. It has some firm tannins underneath—just enough to support the delicious raspberry and red-currant flavors. It is maturing well and will be ready to drink from 2017.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A strong, bold young wine, with good varietal flavors of blackberries and black currants. It's hard in tannins now, and the oak hasn't been integrated even though the wine is nearing the five year mark. Somehow, it doesn't seem like a longterm ager, but it will benefit from a couple years in the bottle.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The heavy bottle indicates the importance attached to this wine by its producer. Structured and full bodied, it bursts with crisp fruits, mineral acidity and a touch of herbaceousness. Keep it until late 2014 to broaden out.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This wine has an unusual combination of sweet and sour sensations that include ripe plum, sour cherry, vanilla, dark chocolate, hay, dill, sage and leather. It's still very young with nervous acidity and aggressive tannins that need time to tame.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A very deep color and smoky, meaty aromas get this full-bodied wine off to a great start, then saturated blackberry, blueberry and espresso flavors kick in. All that fruit comes in a firm package of fine-grained tannins to add welcome texture, and the concentration of flavor lingers on the finish, too.",US-California-Red Blend
"A soft wine that is full of strawberry fruits to go with a sweet citrus edge. The wine has good acidity, in a light apéritif style with pure final raspberry juice.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Peachy, mildly sweet, smooth and inviting. Godeval always makes a true and easy wine that showcases the essence of Godello but doesn't go off the blueprint. Flavors of apple and citrus are well blended, and the grapefruity finish is only mildly pithy. Eminently drinkable white wine from Spain.",Spain-Northern Spain-Godello
"Aromas recall wood, coconut, vanilla and coffee. Sweet oak and a mocha note dominate the dense palate but it lacks fruit richness. It's already spent, with abrasive wood tannins that leave an astringent finish.",Italy-Southern Italy-Red Blend
"White pepper dominates the smell, and the flavor is primarily of candied lemons.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aged and fermented in neutral French oak, this luscious wine is smooth and open, with just the right touch of butter, presumably from partial malolactic fermentation. The mouthfeel is creamy and rich, like a peach cobbler, with a splash of butterscotch.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Very strong and concentrated, with intense Key lime pie flavors, brightened with a squeeze of lemony acidity. Oak adds complex notes of buttered toast and vanilla. This powerful young Chardonnay will hold in the bottle for up to six years.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A somewhat strange nose of overripe mashed red plums and cherries with a strong herbal, piney core. More of the same in the medium weight mouth along with nuances of soft strawberries. Solid finish; drink now.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Soft and rich, this Rhône-style blend is candied in nature with sugary raspberry, blackberry and currant flavors.",US-California-G-S-M
"Ripe berries and cherries vie with each other for attention—this is all about fruit and freshness, with a distinct background of ripeness and generosity. It is easy to like and drink, you never know what you want more: black or red cherry, fruity plum or fresh blueberry.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Zweigelt
"Pronto red is 77% Grenache, with the remainder a blend of Touriga Nacional (11%), Syrah (7%) and Monastrell (5%). It starts off with leather and spice, then folds in cherries and licorice. It's full-bodied, round and slightly warm, with a supple, spice-driven finish. Drink now-2015.",Australia-South Australia-Red Blend
"An unexpected touch of caramel butterscotch or candied fruit could indicate very mild oxidation although the jury is still out. Otherwise, the wine does a good job of presenting austere aromas of old spice, worn leather and dried fruit.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Plum and cherry notes struggle to show themselves under a heavy layer of coconut and sawdust from new American oak. This wine is tightly wound and dense in the mouth, with refreshing acidity and a medium-to-long finish. A year or two in the cellar will allow for better integration.",US-New York-Red Blend
"In this full-bodied, well-earned Reserve-level wine, white peach, cantaloupe and lemon-lime define the ripeness of fruit on the palate, providing a fresh lushness around its substantive body and weight. A hit of decadent toffee lurks on the finish.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas suggesting underbrush, charred earth, toast and mature plum lead the nose. The forward, full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and a hint of tobacco alongside polished tannins. It's already accessible so enjoy over the next few years.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"A good buy, compared to Roessler's more expensive bottlings. It's a county-wide blend, and quite a nice one. Crisp, dry and silky, it shows classic varietal flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranates and spices, accented with smoky sandalwood. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The palest of grey-pink rosés, this is classy, fresh and fragrant. It has a light, orange-zest texture as well as tannins and a mineral edge. Very fresh, it is also worth aging a few months.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Commanding nose, with cherry, purple basil, mineral and meaty elements. Fine depth of fruit, with sweet-tart and earthy notes, and a brisk mouthfeel. The tangy finish with its tart cherry, mineral and earth complexity holds you a long time. Serious, and fulfills Domaine Drouhin Oregon's promise to make great Pinot Noir on a par with Burgundy.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A 100% Merlot aged 18 months in French oak, this hearty wine is rich in cinnamon toast, bittersweet chocolate and dark, black fruit. It's walled in tannins, so let it open a bit and it'll reveal subtle herbal tones.",US-California-Merlot
"Heady, beguiling aromatics dominate and invite in this well-made, robustly full-bodied wine, which is spicy and tart in baked plum, cherry, cranberry and a twist of orange. Zesty acidity gives it a kick on the palate, buoyed by a moderate tannin structure.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Here is a straightforward Malbec that offers the expected mix of berry and herb flavors, plus a suggestion of minerality and a whiff of sweatiness. It's a good companion for a burger or a steak.",US-Washington-Malbec
"Beautiful, bright boysenberry and blackberry aromas meet fennel and pepper scents on the nose of this blend of 64% Grenache and 36% Syrah, which is sold primarily through the winery's Santa Clarita Valley tasting room. A lavish tannic profile decorates the lush palate, where black currant jam, licorice and clove flavors fight for attention.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Characteristic lime-leaf and lemon notes marry with blossoms and grass. The palate, however, is less focused, starting bright, tapering to flatness in the middle, and finishing on the richer side.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a jammy, lusty wine with aromatic notes of graphite on top of core blackberry scents. The palate is chunky and full, while the flavor profile is pure jammy blackberry. A quick, staunch finish is a fine conclusion.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Malbec
"Sticky, puckering tannins wake up the palate and grab it for a wild ride in this reserve-level wine, which is densely ripe and burly in blackberry and tar.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Slightly oxidized tones of pressed apple and pear are lifted by a shock of lemony acidity in this spry semi-dry Riesling. The tangerine palate extends moderately long, encouraged by a swathe of dried herb notes.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Made from fruit selected across this southern Burgundy appellation, this wine has a touch of minerality and more attractive white fruit. It's rich, soft, full-bodied and fruity. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"An appealing wine with notes of orange peel, citrus and red fruit. It's medium-bodied with lively citrus flavors that display a soft feel.",US-Oregon-Tempranillo
"Thick, dense tropical fruit is balanced by acidity and a tartness of green apple and lemon pith in this wine, aged in French oak. Structured and medium bodied, it'll work well at the table.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Restrained on the nose, this bottling by Richard Sanford and Nick de Luca shows light aromas of Marcona almond, lemon zest, Asian pear and Gravenstein apple. The sip is delicate in texture yet grippy with tannic structure, revealing pear flesh and squeezed lime flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A severe wine, its structure deriving from an important wood element and fruit tannins. It brings out apple and green plum skins, with a tangy texture that demands a few months aging.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This is so smooth, rich and mellow, you hardly notice how intense the tannins are. But they are hard, and lock down the flavors of black currant and black licorice, plus the complex notes of minerals, roasted game and dark spices. Drink this Malbec-based blend now after decanting and over the next six years.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A little soft and one-dimensional, with raspberry and cherry cola flavors. Lacks the liveliness that a rosé needs. No oak on this dry wine.",US-California-Rosé
"Earthy and leafy aromas yield to tomato leaf and weighty plum aromas. The palate is full but sharp, with tart, driving pie cherry and herbal flavors. Stays rather hard on the finish, where more tomato rolls out.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of honey-glazed tangerines, lemons and limes abound on this spry, light-footed Riesling, but there's a savory element of nuts and smoke that persists from nose to finish as well. The palate is moderately sweet yet balanced keenly with acidity. The finish is brisk and clean.",US-New York-Riesling
"Roughly two-thirds Shiraz, the 2006 Henry's Seven is a lush, full-bodied blend that combines dark, feral notes of cola and cured meats with brighter red-fruit flavors and an herbal tinge. It's a bit warm on the finish, but that only serves to accentuate its spicy complexity. Drink now–2012.",Australia-South Australia-Red Blend
"This new baby from Crasto is an easygoing wine, full of berry fruits, gentle tannins. It is ready to drink, finishing softly and freshly.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Young and loaded with primary fruit flavors—fresh-picked cherries right off the tree, red delicious apples, just-made cranberry sauce—this is lovely now but built for the long term. The 13.6% alcohol listed is verified by the juicy acidity and just a touch of herb in the back of the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Unusually dry and crisp, this gives up tangy green apple, kiwi and lemon flavors backed by electric acidity, rather light body and a touch of enervating astringency that's unusual in a white wine. Fresh oysters, please.",US-California-Chardonnay
"One of Spain's top value-oriented rosés. It's inviting, colorful, easy to understand and tasty. Aromas of fresh fruits and melon get it going, while the palate is clean, fresh, only mildly candied and full of cherry and red plum flavors. Scores high by keeping it simple. Drink ASAP.",Spain-Northern Spain-Rosé
"Saint-Croix-du-Mont is on the slopes across the Garonne river from Sauternes. In years like 2005, it can produce some fine sweet botrytis wines. This has honey, a bite of botrytis and a great lemon edge. Worth aging, but ready to drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Dusty apple aromas are plain and simple. This has a heavy disposition on the palate despite spritz. Flavors of mango, nectarine and green herbs come with a touch of bell pepper prior to a bulky finish with apple notes.",Spain-Northern Spain-White Blend
"Dry and clean, with straw, hay and other cava-like aromas. Take away the bubbles and this Viura is indeed like cava, so expect green apple, citrus and other crisp, lemony flavors. As varietal Viura from Rioja goes, Faustino has crafted a wine that's well above average and mildly complex.",Spain-Northern Spain-Viura
"Shows the exotic, peppery spiciness and wild, brambly quality you want in a nice Zin, and the wine is dry and clean. But it's a little too thin in fruit, with just a suggestion of blackberries and currants.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Plump red cherry and star anise aromas meet sagebrush and rust on the nose of this appellation blend. It's light bodied on the palate, where tangy acidity presents cranberry, mace and dried meat flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Packaged with a label depicting a colorful if inventive map of the appellation, this wine conveys hibiscus punch, cranberry and cherry notes on the nose, with a touch of lavender and sagebrush. Biting acidity and peppery grip dance on the palate, where cranberry and plum skins are tart and bitter but leveled by fresh oregano herbs.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Tight as a drum, but a little cherry fruit escapes from the nose. It opens up into a sweet, lovely bottle of wine, with a bit of cocoa and coffee in the finish. Well-balanced, with sweet, clean fruit.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This is a very ripe and rather oaky Chardonnay that shows off how well the vintage perfected the grapes. Brims with smoky flavors of pineapple custard, Meyer lemon pie filling, butterscotch and cinnamon spices. Calls for rich fare, such as scallops.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Chopped herb, pine, forest floor and balsamic notes follow through to the palate, rich in vibrant red cherry, cranberry, star anise and white pepper notes. It's still tightly wound, with compact tannins and fresh acidity. Give it time to develop more depth and complexity. Drink 2022–2032.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This is cool-climate fruit, from a vintage the winery describes as “the coolest year we have ever seen.” Nonetheless they have made a good wine, with balanced scents and flavors. It's definitely herbal, but also brings some cured meat and tart, wild cherry flavors into play.",US-Oregon-Syrah
"Offering a spicy, creamy view of Grüner, this is a well-rounded, rich, white fruit-flavored wine. The acidity is a thought in the background initially, but then gives the wine a final, light lift. Screwcap.",Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
"This Brunello opens with a bright ruby color and delivers aromas of cherry cola, Spanish cedar, cigar box, wild berries and spice. It's a streamlined wine that puts more emphasis on elegance than brawn or power. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Saucy raspberry aromas are herbal and briny. This feels chunky and round. Jammy raspberry flavors turn medicinal and herbal, ending with notes of latex and Band-Aid.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Light in body, with savory acidity, this Pinot offers plush flavors of raspberry tart, red cherry pie filling, root beer, mocha and cinnamon spice. It's more elegant than complex. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Cocoa powder is met by overfilling notions of wild blackberry and black cherry in this memorably textured and complex wine from the mountain. A smoothness on the midpalate roughs out the rockiness of the back tannins and fistfuls of supportive oak, finishing in a high-toned minerality that echoes volcanic soils and gravel.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Scratched lemon skin and sliced-apple aromas meet with a light petrol character on this nice and easy-smelling white wine. The palate starts slightly sweet then grows more so, showing flavors of orange soufflé and lemon syrup.",US-California-Riesling
"This is a simple, slightly sweet wine. It tastes like a pineapple, lime and vanilla pastry melted down into wine, with alcohol giving heat, and acidity to make it crisp.",US-California-Roussanne
"A widely available offering from Concannon, this Cab is rich in jammy cherry and vanilla, with a backbone of oak, a nice choice for midweek dinners of rib roast and steak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This bottling is quite tropical on the nose, with plumeria, banana, honeysuckle, sweet peach and Gala apple aromas. The palate is also quite ripe with yellow melon and more Gala apples, but an intriguing texture of crushed rocks and slate keeps it grounded.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a Mâcon region-wide blend, simple and fruity with an attractively crisp texture. It has a citrus character, slightly salty as well as tangy with orange zest. Drink now.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This wine is young, full of the initial burst of crisp fruit. Apple and citrus flavors, and mineral texture, are still developing, filling in from the taut character and acidity. It will be ready to drink from 2018.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"Blackberry, espresso and kitchen spice aromas come together in the glass along with a dash of new leather. The firm palate offers raspberry jam, dried black cherry, raisin and a note of bitter dark chocolate alongside fine-grained tannins.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"An off-dry character sets the scene for this concentrated, already balanced wine. The Hatschbourg vineyard in the southern Alsace village of Voegtlinshoffen is composed of clay and chalk soil on a southeast-facing slope. It gives exceptional ripeness, as here, a warm and full-bodied wine with great swathes of fruitiness. Drink from 2017.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"Made with Moscato, this sparkling dessert wine opens with aromas of fragrant white flower, apricot and a note of chopped herb. The foaming palate offers dried apricot, yellow peach and candied nectarine zest while a lemon drop note signals the close.",Italy-Piedmont-Moscato
"These old, head-trained bush vines make for stunning wines year after year. This vintage shows lemon rind, orange-laced tonic water, yellow pear and a fragrant chilled Pink Lady apple element on the nose. The palate is all about tense texture, but also shows refreshing flavors of green pluot, tart plum and a touch of sweet basil.",US-California-Chenin Blanc
"A nice Pinot, light-bodied and dry, with a fine, silky mouthfeel. The cherry flavors have slightly greener notes of menthol, accented with sweet, smoky oak. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The nose is slightly unfocused, with mealy peach and unripe tropical fruit pervading. Medium bodied, the palate brings slightly stemmy, unripe flavors, with citrus and pineapple rind leading to an astringent finish.",US-Virginia-Chardonnay
"Basic Torrontés aromas of citrus, greens and saline water greet you. The wine is light-framed and rings and zings on the palate. Lemon and green apple share the palate before lime rises up on the finish. A bit clanky but gets the job done when chilled down.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Torrontés
"The wine has tempting aromas like marzipan and pineapple, generous fruit flavors and just enough acidity for balance. It's medium-bodied and feels bright and flavorful in the mouth.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Raspberry and plum aromas include notes of brown sugar and warm pavement. A dense, chewy palate is packed with fruit and tannins. Flavors of minty oak and berry fruits dissolve into a heap of tannin and oak on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A ripe, buttery style of wine, with yellow fruit, toast and a ripe, almost honeyed character. The finish displays some light, zesty acidity.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"The problem with this Zin is high alcohol. In this case, the berry fruit and overall structure just aren't sturdy enough. That lets the alcohol star, making the wine hot and unbalanced.",US-California-Zinfandel
"90-92. Barrel sample. This has some weight and richness, with chunky fruit and sweet tannins. This wine is concentrated and very firm.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Sharp, punchy aromas of citrus, green herbs and celery lead to a tight drawing palate. This tastes feline, bitter and a bit like passion fruit. Pyrazine-based green flavors of thyme and scallion drive the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"Very deep purple for a rosé, although still transparent, this could be mistaken for a light red wine. That's also true for the aromas that include cherry pie, cola and a light dusting of clove. There is a tangy tension to the sip, then flavors of baked red cherry, pastry crust and more clove. It's rather delicious, but a tad heavy for a pink wine.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Vibrant and elegantly structured, this has delicate aromas of red berry, blue flower, aromatic herb and a whiff of cooking spice. The luminous, rather austere palate shows sour cherry, strawberry, star anise and a hint of pipe tobacco alongside youthfully assertive but refined tannins and racy acidity. This is one of the rare Rossos that will get better after a few more years in bottle. Drink 2018–2023.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Here's a basic, Santa Barbara Chardonnay that shows off the region's cool-climate friendliness to the variety. It's dry and crisp and creamy, with pineapple, lime and oak flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This wine is two-thirds Marsanne and one-third Roussanne, both extreme rarities in this appellation. Aromas of pear, peach and fresh flower are followed by dry lightly styled stone-fruit flavors. The concentration doesn't seem all there but it still brings appeal. Try it at the dinner table.",US-Washington-Rhône-style White Blend
"If you like tart, less-than-ripe Sauvignon Blanc, you'll enjoy this one. It's acidic, but relieved by lemon, lime and honey flavors.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a wine that is almost mature. With generous black fruits and tannins that are integrated into the texture, the wine is ripe and fruity. The acidity is still there, giving a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"So young, it tastes like it's still fermenting. Not a bad wine, but freshly tart and strong in grapy flavors. Should calm down by mid-2011 and become a nice, full-bodied and dry red wine.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Exotic spice, toast, cocoa powder and thyme are the lead aromas. Medium to full bodied with a supple attack, the palate picks up muscular tannins as the wine unfurls across the palate, and it ends with a tangy, mineral-tinged finish.",US-Virginia-Merlot
"A direct reflection of the 2012 vintage, with notes of wild strawberry, sarsaparilla, clove and cinnamon. The flavors are medium bodied in style, juicy and appealing.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This blend of 60% Nero d'Avola and 40% Merlot has a pretty fragrance of blue flower, black berry and baking spice. The simple palate is less expressive, offering fleeting wild cherry flavors.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"A forward specimen with lots of oak that settles on cinnamon and wood tannin. Also a touch leafy on the nose, and that's backed by tangy cranberry and acid-driven cherry flavors. Very tight and piercing, which for a 2005 crianza is asking too much.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Dry and fruity, but a little brittle in tannins and acids, this Merlot has red currant, mocha, cinnamon and smoky oak flavors. Drink now.",US-California-Merlot
"Bacon fat and cream soda meet with a flash of patchouli on the nose of this stunning deal from winemaker/author/blogger Alison Crowe. Cherry cola flavors and luscious red fruits get lifted with smoke and plum-skin bitterness, all set against decent tannins and fresh acidity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The Caracal (an African lynx breeding on the estate) is a spicy, dried-fruit driven wine that's ready to drink now.

"This classy Walla Walla Syrah is still young and tightly wound, with juicy acids and flavors of tart berry and wild mountain fruit. As it opens in the glass it starts to show smoked ham and bacon, with black pepper in the back. Tannins are chewy and right on the border between green and black tea, but the bright raspberry fruit shines through. It's got good, crunchy structure and a substantial finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Fresh, tangy and medium bodied, this wine has crisp apple and peach flavors and a mouthcleansing texture.",US-California-Rosé

The wine opens with aromas of cinnamon bark and cranberry, a tugging mushroomy element standing by. Subtle notes of black pepper come into play on the finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Damilano is one of Barolo's historic wineries and Cannubi its most historic vineyard cru. All that history combines here to shape a traditional, yet New World wine with plush roundness and intense notes of spice, leather, pipe tobacco, polished red wood and black currant. It's luscious, velvety and tight in the mouth and will improve with age. Drink with venison or game.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This wine spent time in French, American and Hungarian oak, 25% of it new. It offers a classically herbal expression of the variety, exhibiting notes of black olive and leather over fruity tones. Tight and grippy, it needs to open over time to let the aromas catch up on the palate.",US-California-Merlot

"Straw-yellow in the glass, this wine from organically grown, nearly 35-year-old vines shows iodine, citrus pith, yogurt and seared lemon peels in the restrained, minerally nose.

The wine offers character and pizzazz thanks to the polished quality of its tannins.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Generally 88-pointers don't call for cellaring, but this one could gain style points with time in the bottle. Now it's dark and promising, with berry, cherry, earth and tobacco.

"Little changes at Biondi-Santi. The tannins on this huge 1997 are dense, almost impenetrable. The flavors are of cherry, tobacco, old wood and solid, black fruits. The aftertaste is all tannin at this stage. Despite this rigorous adherence to tradition, the 1997 seems a touch less overwhelming than previous vintages of this classic wine. Nevertheless, age for at least 15 years before drinking.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Fresh easy notes of pear drop rise from the glass. The very slender palate has lemony freshness but also residual sweetness and a pithy phenolic edge. This is fresh, off dry and just balanced. Drink soon.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris

On the one hand, it's bright and vibrant, and on the other, there's a richness of caramel and oak, the wine coming in like a lion, out like a lamb. Cellaring might equalize the sides; hold through 2020.",US-California-Chardonnay

"This premier-cru vineyard, wholly owned by the Devillard family, has produced a broad, ripe wine.

"The alcohol on this Cabernet is fairly high, yet the wine tastes and feels dry, supple and balanced in the mouth, with tannins so smooth, they're drinkable now.

This is certainly an ageable wine that will reward your patience through 2020 or so.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A generous, well-balanced and wonderfully layered wine, this smells deep and plummy, and has a bit of black pepper in the otherwise abundant blackberry flavors.

"The aromas offer notes of char, toast and peach. The flavors are simultaneously broad and sleek in styling, with a finish that lingers.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"A strong, powerful Pinot that's nowhere ready to drink. That's despite massive blackberry, cherry, cola, red currant, licorice and sandalwood flavors that dazzle the palate. The tannins are potent, the acidity is tart and the finish is bone dry. Obviously needs time in the bottle. Try after 2013.",US-California-Pinot Noir

The forest floor and juniper character is strong on the palate, where tart red fruit mixes with pencil lead and bergamot rinds.",US-California-Pinot Noir

Full blackberry, cassis and herbal flavors finish cool and toasty but long due to the wine's full-force acidity.",Uruguay-Canelones-Tannat
"Deep, dusty slate and smoke tones rim the edges of this sleek, laser-edged Kabinett.

"This blend of 55% Roussanne and 45% Grenache Blanc offers broad aromas of cooked apples, honeydew melon and peach custard.

"Five vineyards contribute their best barrels to this outstanding blend, which carries the humble Oregon AVA on its label. It's a testament to the art of blending, as most of the components are also featured in vineyard designates, but here the whole is more than the sum of its parts. It's a showcase of pure, dense, detailed red fruits, set in perfectly matched acid, tannin and mineral elements.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot, aged nearly two years in 80% new French oak, is a ripe, extracted and mightily concentrated wine, offering big flavor in a complex package.

The nose is like a veil of Golden Delicious apple scent. The palate follows with soft apple freshness that is pervaded by a deeper lemony streak. But it is apple charm that stays on the surface.

The flavors are intense and the palate is medium sweet, aptly countered by lemon and passion fruit. This strikes a lovely balance and gives tons and tons of fruit and flavor.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"A terrific wine, smooth, complex and ageworthy. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon from Diamond Mountain, it shows mountain intensity of fruit, with a molten core of blackberries and black currants.

"Ripe plum, spiced blueberry, cedar, toasted oak and tobacco are some of the aromas you'll find in this structured blend of 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. The full-bodied palate delivers blackberries, black currants, clove, espresso, ground pepper and licorice while assertive but fine-grained tannins provide support. Drink 2016–2025.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This is heavily wood dominated. Toast and juice come from wood as much as fruit at this stage. Behind this, generous yellow fruits and a ripe, full-bodied character will lead to a ripe and complex wine. It needs aging, so don't drink before 2016.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"Opaque and thick, this wine is robust, yet balanced—a study in cedar and pencil lead that drives into a dimension of dried herb. The savory components find companionship in fruitier notes of cherry and blueberry, before a tannic, oaky finish closes things out.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Mourvèdre (62%) takes the lead on this wine followed by Syrah (21%) and Grenache. It's aromatic and appealing, with notes of roasted meat, black pepper, herb and plum. The red- and black-fruit flavors are concentrated and bring a compelling sense of texture. Smoke and savory flavors linger on the finish. It's a standout at this price.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Very light aromas of apricot and apple blossom show on this appellation blend by the single-vineyard specialists, whose winery is based in Los Gatos. A nice touch of acid marks the palate, where lemon zest meets with ripe Pink Lady apple flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This silky-textured, medium-bodied wine starts off with aromas of toasted marshmallow and ripe citrus. The flavors show more range, covering hints of melon, white peach, lime, pineapple and roasted cashew, before finishing long and crisp.",Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"Big, rich and dense, this Pinot Noir shows massive, in-your-face flavors of oak, raspberry-cherry jam and chocolate. You can give this a few years of aging or try decanting, but it seems best enjoyed soon for its sheer youthful power.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A mix of blueberry, plum and animal aromas leads to a wiry, clipped palate fueled by tartaric acid. Lightly salted plum flavors are slightly jammy, while a blueberry note is brought back on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Another of Noceto's stellar small-production Sangiovese, this one plummy with tobacco and sour cherry most prominent and a slight hint of sweetness as it finishes. Dos Oakies comes from the winery's oldest vineyard section of Sangiovese and has a loyal following of Sangiovese lovers.",US-California-Sangiovese
"While this wine comes out of the gate showing little but earth and dark fruit aromas, it lightens and develops more delineation with air, eventually revealing berry, plum and spice notes. Right now, the flavors are almost jammy, so purists may want to wait a few years before opening a bottle. Full-bodied, chewy and rich, this superripe Hermitage should age well for up to 15 years.",France-Rhône Valley-Syrah
"Aromas of pear, citrus and almond should be familiar to anyone who knows Chilean Chardonnay, but to call this wine elevated or beyond regular would be a stretch. The palate is slightly lemony and green, and the finish has a persistent tang. Seems like basic Casablanca Chard to us.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"Soft and rounded, the wine is fresh as well as full in the mouth. There is a creamy character to this full and citrusy wine that makes it good as an apéritif.",Portugal-Bucelas-Arinto
"Light, bright and crisp, this is a tangy wine. Its floral aroma and its juicy tropical fruits are both part of a wine that has been made to be drunk young, fruity and easily. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"This well-aged release, from one of Oregon's premier vineyards, is soft and approachable, well-rounded with lovely plum and black cherry fruit holding down the center. Barrel aging adds baking spices to liven up the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"New leather, menthol, ripe berry and Asian spice aromas emerge in the glass while the firm palate offers dried black cherry, pomegranate, star anise and a hint of game. You'll also notice a green note of powdered sage. Assertive, close-grained tannins squeeze the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
On display here are bright aromas of red fruit and forest berry followed by deeper tones of dark chocolate and licorice. The wine is smooth and round with rich texture and well-proportioned sweetness on the close.,"Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"A little bit baked, but overall it's a good, semirich Malbec with roasted, dark fruit flavors and a backdrop of chocolate. The palate has slightly more acidity than you might expect, so it doesn't come across heavy or out of whack. Regular wine done well.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Quady's Right Bank blend is three-quarters Cabernet Franc and one-quarter Merlot. Smoky and showing a lightly funky scent when opened, it develops into a leathery and tannic red wine, checkered with red and black fruits, hints of tobacco and a vein of graphite.",US-Oregon-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Cedar, cinnamon and nutmeg notes show in the aromas and continue in the flavors. This complexity blends well with the classic Merlot flavors of black cherry and subtle herbs. It's medium to full bodied, but very smooth in texture. The blend is Merlot, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah.",US-California-Red Blend
"One of Amirault's single parcel wines, this is a rich and smoothly tannic. There is a black fruit and smoky wood element, while big juicy fruits dominate the firm structure, giving a wine that has both potential and drinkability sooner. Age this powerful wine for 4–5 years.",France-Loire Valley-Cabernet Franc
"Made in a high-alcohol, extracted style, this Petite is explosive in blackberry jam, currant and spice flavors. The tannins are brisk, as you'd expect with this variety, while a pleasant streak of acidity cuts across the richness and gives the wine zest. Drink now.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Dark berry, huckleberry, wood spice and cocoa aromas are followed by palate-coating blue and purple-fruit flavors.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Spicy cranberry/raspberry fruit is at the heart of this bright, quaffable and value-priced wine. There's a light dusting of pepper also, but it's the fresh fruit that stands out.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Pretty expensive for a Petite Sirah, but it really is fantastic. Shows the variety's powerful tannins and fruit, with a velvety texture framing jammy blackberries, blueberries, carob, vanilla, exotic spices and smoky cedar. Will develop for many years, but there's no reason not to drink it now.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Coffee grinds and caramel mingle with hints of popcorn and dried herbs in this curious blend of white grapes which have been aged Sherry-style in a solera. Whiffs of dried fruit and caramel are enticing, but the palate juxtaposes craggy acidity with mouthfeel that's dampening and flat.",US-New York-White Blend
"Vigorous bubbles present a Pinot Noir-like nose of crushed rocks, Indian spice and sour earth on one of the best Central Coast sparklers of the vintage. The intriguing flavors center on pluot and nectarine flesh, with fringes of salinity, lemon juice, cardamom and even dashes of curry.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Gramona is known for yeasty, complex sparklers, and this falls into that paradigm. The nose is definitely yeasty, with apple and green melon aromas. It's a bit soft for Cava, but that's because it's an '05 that rested on lees for years. Flavors of toasted bread and apple are long on complexity and short on fruit, but once again that's what distinguishes Gramona from the masses.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"With just the right amount of wood aging, this is soft, rich and smooth. Tannins are already well integrated into the blackberry fruits, giving a wine that is fruity, juicy and good for medium-term aging. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Made from mountain grapes, this is an extraordinarily rich, concentrated young Cabernet Sauvignon. It's marked by classic varietal flavors of blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and cassis liqueur. A minor quibble is that it's too soft and melted for further development, but it scores high on the deliciousness scale.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Although the stars at Saint Clair are the Reserve and Pioneer Block wines, the regular SB bottling has maintained a high level of quality. The 2008 boasts exuberant passion fruit and grapefruit aromas and flavors, backed by fresh, grassy notes. It's medium in body, with a mouthwatering, fresh finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Produced from old vines on the Chatelard estate, this wine is smooth, ripe and full of vibrant red fruits. There is a good balance between acidity and rich fruit with just a light core of tannins in the background. Drink now.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"From the good winds (Bons Ventos) estate, this balanced wine has good acidity as well as black-currant fruit. Tannins give the wine its dry core and structure. Nine months in wood have added spice and the smooth texture. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese Red
"91-93. Barrel sample. An attractive and fruity wine that offers soft, cushioned tannins, along with ripe, easy fruit.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This big, bold and ripe wine is packed both with tannins and concentrated, ripe fruits. It's smooth, opulent, with a burst of black berry flavors that are shaped by the firm structure. The wood aging shows as spice and smokiness, giving further richness to this powerful wine. Drink from 2018.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Squeezed lime, pear shavings and poached apple arise on the nose of this bottling. There is a tingling and tactile acidity on the sip, but only very light flavors of green pear and lime rind.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This wine is rich and flashy with flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, red currant, mocha, oak and spice. Firm tannins and zesty acidity add structure and brightness. It's tasty now, but should be better by 2016, as it begins to develop bottle notes.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Coming from one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine brings aromas of dark fruit, iron and coffee. The fruit flavors are sweet and well proportioned, pulling up toward the finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Ripe and generous with sweet berry flavors, but still very young, this wine has dark tannins and a dry core. Drink next year to enjoy its warm, full-bodied character.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Good old Navarro is outdoing itself with the 2013 and 2014 Pinot Noirs. In this one, vivid black-cherry aromas, tangy but deep cherry and cranberry flavors, and a nice, firm and appropriately tannic texture add up to a concentrated and nicely proportioned wine. It has the flavor oomph to pair with something as big as a roast, and the tangy texture to dissolve the richest salmon.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This single-pago wine is earthy, rooty, herbal and almost grassy smelling. The mouthfeel is clampy, with dried berry, herbal shadings and a chunky, earthy finish. As a whole there's a malty character to this wine, but it has elements of quality and character.",Spain-Central Spain-Red Blend
"Zanna Riserva is a delicious wine with oak tones of chocolate and vanilla bean that are backed by touches of black fruit, currant, leather and spice. It finishes with soft, plump density and loads of black fruit and plum. Very nice.",Italy-Central Italy-Montepulciano
"Sole dei Padri is among the top three best Syrahs from Italy. The wine is impenetrable, deeply concentrated and packed full with intensity and charm. You'll get notes of black spice, leather, tobacco, blackberry and cola. The mouthfeel is fantastically caressing and velvety.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Syrah
"We won't call this the best Terrunyo SB to date, but it is typically clean, mineral and full of lime and passion fruit. The overall balance and purity are up the ladder, while the flavors of green fruits, passion fruit, brine and lime don't hold back. Top notch SB from Chile to drink now.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Clean and stylish, with hints of ginger ale and citrus on the nose. Good in terms of texture and flavors, with citrus and juicy nectarine working the palate. Focused and fairly long on the finish, with depth and integrity. Sweet in the extra dry style, but not candied or artificially sugared.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Ripe plum and berry aromas are on the soft and cuddly side, but have some spunk. The palate on this classic Garnacha-Craignan-Syrah blend is adequately juicy and fresh, with a basket's worth of berry flavor. And the finish is complementary and offers some chocolate as an aftertaste. Drink now and over the next two years.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Apple, peach and melon aromas are clean and fruity. The palate on this Verdejo is melony, which matches the wine's melon and papaya flavors. On the finish, a note of apple cider is detectable. Because of moderate acidity and some flab, it's advisable to drink this now.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"This wine kept improving in the glass over a period of hours, and as it did so, the score kept rising. Initial scents of Bourbon barrel gave way to rich blueberry and black cherry fruit, set in a roasted, potent mix of darker flavors. Smoke, coffee liqueur, a whiff of stem, a streak of vanilla, all tightly wound and elevated with scents of citrus peel.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Restrained ripeness does not make this an obvious wine, but it comes towards you if you spend time with it. Notions of yellow pear and Golden Delicious apple partner with an herbal twist and refreshing citrus acidity.",Austria-Burgenland-Austrian white blend
"Zippy lemongrass and white grapefruit flavors penetrate this vibrant but richly mouth-filling Spätlese. It's juicy, forward and accessible yet elegant, finishing with reverberating lime and lemon-zest astringency. Drink now through 2020.",Germany-Rheinhessen-Riesling
"Loads of black fruit intensity is backed by soft notes of chocolate, leather and spice. The wine boasts a very plump and round style that makes it a pleasure to savor.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This proprietary blend of Zinfandel, Syrah, Grenache, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon delivers a deep and layered nose. Wild blackberry jam, pine pitch and white sage converge, like a walk through the California chaparral. The acidity is amazingly vibrant, with flavors of bright purple fruit, pepper and crushed herbs on the finish.",US-California-Red Blend
"Good flavors of tangerines, Meyer lemons and limes in this crisply acidic white blend. It's pretty dry, and very clean. A nice, inexpensive and versatile by-the-glass wine for restaurants.",US-California-White Blend
"The aromas offer notes of dark coffee, baking spice, vanilla, and barrel spices. The palate pulls no punches with full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors along with lightly grainy tannins. The wood plays prominently but it works.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality. Defines California-style decadence, but drink now, as the wine will quickly go downhill.",US-California-Chardonnay
"One of a range of wines under the Homage to Heritage import label, this fruit-driven wine has apple and green plum fruits, sustained by great acidity and a crisp, mineral texture. Drink from 2016.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Aged in a mixture of new French (80%) and American oak, this leads with barrel notes of woodspice followed by herbs, brown stems, blue fruit and cinnamon. It shows good concentration with quite tart acids and dry, chalky tannins.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This heavily oaked Garnacha smells like clove and horsehide. A drawing, scratchy, resiny palate offers clove and barrel-spice flavors. The wine feels tannic and rubbing on a finish that tastes exclusively of oak-based clove.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"Very clean and clear, and even though it's a 2009 it is still holding onto its core freshness and character. White fruits and flower blossoms work the nose, and the palate is now fully mature, elegant and smooth. Flavors of peach, melon and kiwi are clean and tasty. Albariño at its best.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"This is a dry wine, ruled by tannins. It is firm, the juicy fruit underneath needs time. It will have a juicy future, so wait until late 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This Pinot Noir is rich and elegant, but somewhat straightforward with flavors of raspberry and cherry wrapped in a pleasant coating of smoky oak. It's less ageable than Truchard's 2010 vintage so decant and drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This Monastrell opens with resiny, lactic aromas and a strong note of rubber. It's big, blocky and chunky in feel, while the flavor profile revolves around briny plum and rubber.",Spain-Levante-Monastrell
"This vineyard has been source to wildly variable Pinot Noirs, but Garnet, has succeeded in wresting a fine Pinot Noir. It shows the dry silkiness and acidity you want from a coastal Pinot, with elaborate, oak-influenced cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors that finish dry and spicy. Enjoy it over the next five years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"KJ's Avant bottling is refreshing with fruity essence, showing sweet flavors of honey, peaches, apricots and nectarines. With only a touch of oak, it has a bright, fresh mouthfeel that makes it especially attractive.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a nonvintage wine based around the 2010 vintage (R stands for Récolte or harvest). Now showing signs of maturity, with hints of toast, it is a rich, full-in-the-mouth wine layered with swathes of citrus and apple fruit flavors balanced with a tight, mineral texture. This dry wine is ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Perfumed and fragrant, this shows wood and fruity perfumes in harmony. It's attractive, forward and ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Light and generally neutral, this is Torrontés that's easy to quaff. The nose is mildly citric, but it doesn't go much further than that. And the palate is crisp, with peach, apple and nectarine flavors. Clean and medium on the finish; gets the job done. Drink now and drink well chilled.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Torrontés
"Ostensibly a Central Otago producer, Rabbit Ranch sources the fruit for its Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough. The result is a lemony, grapefruity wine, with subdued herbal notes lurking in the background. It's medium in body, with a crisp, citrusy finish. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"A blend of 80% Nerello Mascalese and 20% Nerello Cappuccio, this medium-bodied red has aromas of wild berry, mocha, cake spice and a whiff of toast. The straightforward, easygoing palate offers wild cherry and star anise alongside fine-grained, rather fleeting tannins. Drink through 2018.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
This warm fruity wine is rounded and ripe with flavors of vanilla as well as red-berry fruits. It is soft with just a light tang of orange zest and finishing acidity. Drink this attractive wine now.,France-Loire Valley-Rosé
"This wine seems overtaken with scents and flavors of tree tar and resin. The impression of pine resin cuts out the fruit, leaving some woody flavors in the finish.",US-Oregon-Merlot
"Made from a blend of Sangiovese, Colorino, Canaiolo and Ciliegiolo, this vibrant Rosso has sensations of black plum, ripe sour cherry, baking spices and Mediterranean herbs. The palate delivers brisk acidity and lithe tannins. Enjoy it soon with substantial first courses like pasta topped with meat sauce or four-cheese gnocchi.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This is a traditional style—emphasizing earthy tannins and spicy fruit and is rough around the edges—but is a wine that would relish being partnered with sausages, salamis and hard cheeses. There is plenty of weight, the acidity coming from minerality and wood.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Admittedly it's a bit late to be reviewing this 2005 Verdejo, but it's still fairly vital as it shows waxy citrus aromas in front of plump but anonymous white fruit. Still hanging in there with some persistence and mouthfeel, but get at it right away.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"Here's a compact and easy Müller-Thurgau that shows medium aromatic intensity with citrus, peach and brimstone. The wine's crisp, dry close with its subtle touch of honey makes it perfect for fried finger foods or tempura.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Müller-Thurgau
"A classy Chardonnay for sipping now. Dry and zesty in acidity, it has appealing tangerine, Meyer lemon, white flower, honey and mineral flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay

"With its patented blend of ripe plum and berry aromas matched against notes of wood smoke, herbs and leather, this is ripped and focused in the mouth, with strong but manageable tannins. Flavors of buttery oak, schist, blackberry and cassis culminate with mocha, vanilla and an overall sense of greatness. Drink from 2017 through 2025.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Here's a fruity wine to drink now with barbecue. It's rich and ripe in blackberries and blueberries, sprinkled with cocoa and black pepper, and wrapped into firm tannins that want some sweetly grilled meat to tear into.",US-California-Red Blend
"This has a vivid, ripe, black cherry flavor, with fresh sweetness and bursting acidity. It makes for a gorgeous, generous character buoyed up by firm tannins, a lively texture and finish, and no noticeable oak. A great find from a small, ambitious Lake County winery that loves Italian varietals.",US-California-Barbera
"Soft and friendly, this has instantly likeable cherry, cola, anise and sandalwood flavors. Perfect for drinking now.",US-California-Merlot
"This Chardonnay shows the ripe fruit and tangy acidity derived from this cool-climate vineyard. It bears tart apricot, orange and mineral flavors, balanced by oaky notes of vanilla and buttered toast. Drink now.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Aged 18 months in barrique, Oinos opens with a crisp and snappy quality of berry fruit followed by clean lines, good acidity and light spice shadings. Bitter chocolate and cherry liqueur appear on the close.",Italy-Central Italy-Montepulciano
"A little rustic and sharp, but perfectly okay if you're looking for an everyday Cab to elevate simple fare. It shows black currant and oak flavors, and is thoroughly dry.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Elegant in fine-grained tannins, this well-made, complex wine offers savory cranberry and cassis plus brighter, spicier red fruit, alongside a layering of graphite, dried herb and chocolate. Full bodied, it remains balanced throughout, finishing with length and breadth.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Full bodied and definitely fruity without being sweet, this wine from Fulcrum comes straight at the taste buds with opulent black cherry and tart raspberry flavors on a vivid texture. Having spent 15 months in French oak before bottling, it tastes a bit dense and muted at this point, and should be best after 2018.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"There is a touch of bitterness in this wine, giving it an edgy character. There is plenty of fruitiness with notes of apple skin and lemon flavors that are bright and fresh. It needs a few months in bottle to fully integrate.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"This classic cool-climate California Chardonnay shows intensely concentrated kumquat, lime and peach flavors, off set by bright acidity. There's quite a bit of oak on it, but it's balanced, and adds a pleasant layer of buttered toast flavor.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The crispness is paramount here, maybe too much, meaning that the wine is very green. Of course, this is Riesling and is way too young now. For the moment, the fruit is taut and strung out, and it certainly needs 2–3 years.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"Intensely concentrated and nuanced with oak, spice and citrus rind, there's a whole lot more than insipid quaffing in store for this Pinot Grigio. Lithe, lean and deeply mineral in style, it's a wine meant for slow sipping and pondering.",US-New York-Pinot Grigio
"A beautiful red wine for drinking now. It's dry and smooth, with that herbal edge you sometimes find in a Sonoma Cabernet. There's a polished, complex stream of dried red and black currants and cola, with a pleasant touch of smoky oak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A ripe, thickly extracted Sangiovese that offers loads of blueberry fruit and cookie dough aromas. It's surprisingly thick and creamy in the mouth with toasted nut flavors on the close.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This hits 15.5% alcohol—amazingly high for a Columbia wine. The tart red fruit is offset with sweet grain and dried herbs, almost like an old vine Zin from northern California. Somehow the herbs overmatch the berry flavors, which seem a bit on the light side, despite the high alcohol. Young vines?",US-Washington-Zinfandel
"Lots of oak on this Chardonnay, which is dominated by toothpicky vanilla and buttered toast aromas and flavors. Underneath is a fine, crisp wine, with tangerine and sweet Meyer lemon flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This has great concentration of fruit, texture and acidity. It has white and green fruits layered upon the mineral and zesty texture. The wine is ripe and yet so crisp and fresh. It is ready to age for many years.",Austria-Kamptal-Riesling
"Shy and reserved, this cool-climate wine opens coyly with a burst of spearmint on the nose, evolving into layers of flavor steeped in rhubarb, black cherry and tea. Soft and lilting, the wine's finish conjures thoughts of strawberry cream.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The Rutherford grapes that go into this wine travel down to Santa Barbara post-harvest, a journey that doesn't diminish the wine's sense of place. It represents its dusty provenance well amid a taste of sanguine tannins, soy sauce and ripe plum.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This rich Sauvignon Blanc shows classic aromas of crushed tomato vine, cantaloup and a hint of bell pepper. The palate shows succulent green melon and apple flavors, with a hint of smoke and a freshly acidic backbone. This will pair well with asparagus dishes or pasta topped with pesto.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"A distinguished Cabernet, rich in fruit and impeccably oaked. But it's young. There's a fresh, jammy taste to the blackberries, cassis and dark chocolate, and the tannins are brisk and fuzzy. Don't drink it until at least 2015, and it should develop for years afterward.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripe, soft and very drinkable, this has a generous structure that cushions the tannins with rounded black fruits. The acidity and the warm, generous character of the 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc blend net a fine representation of the fruity 2012s. This is Bordeaux consultant Stéphane Derenoncourt's home turf. Wooden fermenters and 16 months in barrel (40% new) necessitate time, so drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This blend of Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio opens with pretty aromas of violet, berry and spice. The palate offers white cherry, pink grapefruit and mineral with a hint of baking spice.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"Endowed with ample tannin, this may be one New Zealand Pinot Noir that requires additional bottle age. That said, positive future evolution is by no means guaranteed. Its dark, savory style is one that combines black cherry fruit with notes of roasted meat and dark coffee.  Drink from 2016–2020.",New Zealand-Martinborough-Pinot Noir
"Campo Prognài is a gracefully oak-aged Valpolicella Superiore that shows surprising density and persistency with lively aromas of cherry, blackberry, toasted almond and exotic spice. Pair this wine with roasted chicken or meatloaf.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Made for broad release, this wine impresses for its rounded, approachable layers of dried herb and anise, the tannin and oak lightly applied. Blended with 10% Merlot, it finds a jolt of richness on the finish, a showcase for notions of chocolate, cherry and blackberry.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Rose, violet, wild berry and menthol aromas unfold in the glass. The bracing palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and clove alongside assertive, close-grained tannins that leave a mouth-puckering finish. Drink after 2020.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A very pretty pale salmon color, this wine is principally Grenache (64%) and Roussanne (23%) with the rest Counoise and Lemberger. Aromas of watermelon and rosewater are followed by just off-dry, mouthwatering citrus and cherry flavors that linger.",US-Washington-Rosé
"This is a fairly lean and acidic wine, with dry cranberry and herb aromas. The palate is drying and wiry, with a peppery, herbal red-fruit flavor, plus a bit of rubber on the finish.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Carmenère
This bright and easy-drinking wine opens with delicate floral aromas of acacia and Spanish broom. The linear palate offers notes of lemon zest and peach alongside racy acidity that leaves a refreshing finish. Simple but well-made.,Italy-Central Italy-Verdicchio
"Here's a simple, standard Chardonnay that is more neutral than anything, but at this level that's really what one should expect.

"A lovely Cab for drinking now and over the next few years. Shows a classy structure, with rich tannins and ripe fruit flavors of black currants, mocha and cinnamon.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The estate wine of Coutinel is dominated by the local Négrette grape. With the addition of 15% Syrah and (unusual for this part of the world) 15% Gamay, the wine is structured while also juicy. Soft tannins and black fruits are shot through with an attractive perfumed character. Drink from 2018.",France-Southwest France-Red Blend
"Firm and fragrant, this offers aromas of wild berry, forest floor, pressed rose, baking spice and a balsamic whiff of menthol. The bold, robust palate doles out cherry-marinated in spirits, fleshy raspberry, licorice and chewing tobacco alongside firm, velvety tannins. Thanks to the juicy fruit, you can't detect the hefty alcohol. Drink through 2026.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This soft, light-bodied wine is on the savory side, a taste of cranberry and rhubarb at its core. It dances in cooler-climate aspects of forest floor and herb, with an unexpected aroma of menthol sneaking into the mix.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Made from Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier, this fruity white shows lots of complexity for the money. It's crisp and off-dry, with citrus, peach, honeysuckle and spice flavors finished with a kiss of smoky, vanilla oak.",US-California-White Blend
"Take a few bucks off the price, and this would be a good value. As things stand, this Chardonnay, which is a blend of Santa Clara Valley and Santa Cruz Mountains fruit, is fairly standard. It's dry and crisp, with pleasant lemon-custard flavors that turn a little unripe on the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A tough wine to like. It's tannic, acidic and dry, with an astringent feel unrelieved by modest blackberry and tobacco flavors. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"92-94 A hugely fruity wine, very rich, concentrated and dense. It has great power and richness, the berry fruits racing with ripeness.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a beautiful Bordeaux blend, offering the kind of classic poise and exotic flair that South Africans are so good at delivering. On the nose, soft mint, chocolate, cedar and black currant beckon, and on the palate, spice and minerality mingle with the earthier elements. The structure is good, and there's ample complexity, but the wine is still approachable.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Cool, steely tones juxtapose intensely sweet mango, peach and honey flavors in this delightful value kabinett. Cutting lime and lemon acidity and a briskly textured palate lead to a mouthwatering finish. Drink now through 2022.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"This vineyard is far better known for Pinot Noir, although Failla has excelled with its Chardonnay. Novy's 2010 isn't particularly like Chardonnay. Too floral. Could almost be Viognier. Yet it's a fine wine, crisp and rich in orange, lime and honeysuckle flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The Bishop's Blend is the value bottling at William Church, and the wine that most varies from vintage to vintage. Despite a price bump, the value is still there. In this vintage it's a five grape Bordeaux-style blend with a splash of Grenache as well. Initially silky and bursting with pretty red fruits, it moves into darker fruits as well, with cassis and black cherry. The balance is spot on.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This is a pretty rose hue, and follows in a light, tart style. Despite its apparent simplicity, it shows surprising depth of flavor, highlighted with fresh strawberries and Bing cherries. There's a touch of Juicy Fruit gum also, and the wine should be consumed now through 2020.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Mature orchard fruit, lychee, citrus zest and a balsamic note lead the way. The savory palate shows citrus zest and an unusual salty hint of cured meat alongside fresh acidity. A toasted note marks the finish.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"Rock solid, this substantial Merlot is grounded in earth flavors, laced with butter cookie, and finished with tart tannins. The fruit is tight and tangy.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Concentrated, silky smooth and subtly complex, this is almost like a dessert wine, yet technically dry. Aromas of pear tart and toasted walnut grab the attention, followed by deep, layered flavors reminiscent of lemon, cream and frangipane. The texture is seductively smooth and the finish lasts for at least 30 seconds. This wine provides a great example of posh indulgence.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A little gaseous and funky on the nose, but that's common for inexpensive Garnacha. Once it unfolds, it deals saturated, chunky black-fruit flavors, a jammy mouthfeel and fatness on the finish. It isn't all that structured, but it doesn't lack for size. Maybe a touch green at its core, but given the price that's not a major fault.",Spain-Catalonia-Garnacha
Earthy notes of pollen accent robust yellow peach and quince in this medium-sweet Kabinett. Fine brisk texture and scintillating acidity lend a lacy fragile feel to the palate. The finish lingers sweetly.,Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"The finest Gamache Cabernet Franc since the 2008, this is arguably the best value in the winery's entire lineup. There's excellent varietal character on display, a mix of blueberries and coffee grounds, and the overall balance is improved by virtue of the cooler 2011 vintage, keeping alcohol levels in check.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"This Dolcetto offers a correct nose with fresh layers of cherry, blueberry and wild berries. There isn't huge intensity here but the wine does offer a full, soft mouthfeel with some mild tannins on the close.",Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto

"Heady aromas of mango and yellow peach follow through to the zesty, full-bodied palate along with a mineral note. Bracing acidity brightens the flavors and leaves a tangy finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Kerner
"Pineapple appears first on the nose and palate, followed by high-toned acidity and a back-up of lemon and lime. Medium bodied, the wine remains light and crisp throughout, finishing in a swirl of lemon zest and grapefruit pith.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Made with 85% Merlot blended with varying amounts of Petit Verdot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of truffle, underbrush, baked plum and dark cooking spice. The palate delivers licorice, roasted coffee bean and blueberry extract alongside astringent tannins that dry out the palate. While the tannins are still aggressive, the fruit richness is starting to dry out.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Light and fruity, this has a yeasty edge along with acidity. On the palate, there are lots of green fruits, offering a dancing, lively character. At the end, there is a touch of vanilla.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Tight, bright and very crisp, this is a lively and fruity wine. Citrus fruit flavors compete happily with the red berries to give a bone-dry wine, light and fresh at the end.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"Belnero is a Sangiovese-based wine (with a tiny percentage of outside grapes) that shows loads of Montalcino typicity and elegance. If the rules governing Rosso di Montalcino are changed, those new wines might resemble Belnero.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Plummy yet cool, with a greenish, floral note that adds lift and interest to the dark-fruit aromas and flavors. This is a bit austere and dusty, but long on the finish, so drink 2018–2030.",New Zealand-Martinborough-Pinot Noir
"This ripe, soft selection is full of fresh white fruit and apricot flavors. An apéritif style, it's warm and fruity, its tight acidity balanced by the rich aftertaste.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
Smoky oak meets a soft texture that showcases black cherry and berry in this full-bodied red. It's boldly lush and seasoned in classic hints of cola.,US-California-Pinot Noir
"This fragrant Barolo has lovely floral and underbrush aromas and a restrained palate showing cherry and spice. It's tightly tannic and very nervous, needing more time to soften up.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"After years of underperforming with Merlot, Merriam comes roaring back with this rich, savory wine. With blackberry, raisin, blueberry, licorice and pepper flavors. This finishes dry and spicy.",US-California-Merlot
"This dry red wine offers bold black cherry and blackberry aromas. Similar fresh fruit flavors and subtle accents of baking spices come out with the second sip and linger on the finish. A good, gripping texture of moderate tannins and acidity helps to make it really appetizing.",US-California-Red Blend
"Tight and tart, wrapped up in a core of smoky black currant fruit. The acids seem a bit adjusted, and the wine needs time to breathe open, but the main thing is that it's a clean and well-defined evocation of the almost 40-year-old vineyard, the oldest in the Rattlesnake Hills.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is soft and rich with dense apricot and red berry fruits over a spice layer. That gives the wine a tangy character, textured with minerality. A bite at the end comes from the pepperiness.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This 100% varietal wine, fermented and aged in stainless steel, is silky and creamy, with a medium body and texture that retains a sizzle of freshness on the palate. Well balanced, it offers melon, green apple and lemon, with a tease of fresh-cut peach, ending crisp and clean.",US-California-Albariño

"With its forward acidity, this shows its fresh side before revealing its ripe red-berry flavors. Tannins form a firm, solid base that dominates the finish.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The two grapes here are more commonly found in the Douro. Here in the south of Portugal, they give a softer character—less mineral more ripe apple and pear fruitiness. The aftertaste does keep the delicious wine bright and lively.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese White
"This is a soft, simple white marked by green olive and vanilla bean flavors that feel concentrated and full on the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Fragrant in game, lavender, herb and red berry fruit, Terre Rouge's only California appellation Syrah is dusty, savory and reasonably light, approachable from beginning to end. On the finish, enjoy handfuls of peppery spice.",US-California-Syrah
"This opens with aromas of mature black currant and dark baking spice. The full-bodied palate offers mature black cherry, ripe blackberry, licorice and pipe tobacco alongside a backbone of firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017 through 2022.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Soft and somewhat rustic, this is a flavorful Pinot Noir, with herb, earth, citrusy acids, leather and quite tart cherry fruit. It would not fit into a textbook definition of classic varietal flavor, but it feels handmade, and it is light years beyond much of the corporate plonk being labeled Pinot Noir these days.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"From its origin in 1789, the Barthe family vineyards were in the hands of sons. In 1991, Véronique Barthe took over and is now developing sustainable vineyards. This vintage is perfumed with touches of fruit candies that will probably integrate better as the wine settles down. Behind this confected front, there is good fruit, crisp acidity and a lively, bright aftertaste. Wait until late 2016 to drink.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"It's hard to find any Tannat in California— let alone good Tannat—and Sobon has done a nice job here, combining leather and boysenberry fruit to good effect. In the back layers is a trace of menthol.",US-California-Tannat
"High alcohol gives the wine heat, especially in the finish. It's also overripe, with the blackberries veering into port-like raisins and prunes. But it is thoroughly dry, with good acidity and tannins. Tasted twice, with consistent results.",US-California-Syrah
"This is a lively, juicy wine. It shows the fruitiness of the vintage balanced with a sense of structure. There is a freshness to this wine that gives it great lift and makes it likely to be drinkable soon. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A solid wine, showing some generosity and richness, the fruits displaying a fine balance between sweetness, dry tannins and bright acidity. It has some of the sensuous character of good Volnay, opening into ripeness. Worth aging for several years, but already offering considerable pleasure.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"In honor of Adam Comartin's daughter, who's named after the Australian city where he learned a bit of winemaking, this bubblegum pink wine offers plush and inviting aromas of light strawberry, peach skins and watermelon juice. Rounded pink and red fruits show on the palate, cut by orange zest, packed up with edgy acid and grippy tension. Quite complex.",US-California-Rosé
"From a tiny coastal vineyard, this wine appears light-bodied and delicate at first, building its power slowly in the glass. Sous bois, earthy spice and savory tea give it an edginess unfettered by fruit, while a healthy tannic structure keeps it grounded.",US-California-Pinot Noir

There are evident oak tones of vanilla and spice that already showing signs of smooth integration. It offers sophisticated fruit and cherry flavors on the long fade.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Espresso, dark chocolate, herb and purple fruit aromas lead to a soft, smooth palate in this wine. Fruit and barrel notes play equal parts, yet it comes up short on the finish.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Merlot (73%) takes the lead on this wine, which is rounded out by Malbec (12%), Cabernet Sauvignon (7%), Petit Verdot (4%) and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of herb, barrel spice, pencil lead and red and black fruit are followed by plump yet elegant fruit flavors backed by chalky tannins. It shows a lot of restraint.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Rich, fruity and textured, this expresses freshness with its acidity and red-currant flavors. These cut through the tangy texture, giving a tight aftertaste. The wine can be drunk immediately for its crispness or held until late 2016 to let it soften.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"By its very name, this is the top wine from this estate in the Tarn region, which is close to Gaillac. It is powerful, with a medicinal and bitter chocolate edge. The fruit is firm, darkly tannic, rich and worth aging.",France-Southwest France-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This 100% Cabernet is the winery's best amongst their new releases. It's rich and ripe with blackberries and cherries, along with lots of new French oak.

"This is a new style for Redoma, smoother and fruitier when young than in the past. Old vines give concentration and extra richness, making it velvet-textured and packed with black fruits, This will be an impressive wine as it ages. Drink from 2019.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This memorably beautiful and delicious wine is made from estate-grown Grenache. The grapes weren't designated for saignee, but rather picked specifically to make this tart and tangy expression of an inviting grape. Orange in color, almost like a beer, it's dry and sneakily succulent, with inviting floral aromas at its core and enough body to stay interesting as it develops.",US-California-Rosé
"Aromas of prune, blackberry, lemon peel and shoe polish are dark and earthy. This feels full and chewy, with hard tannins.

"Quite Burgundian in nature, this offering is not opulent, but is very well defined, with an almost etched nature. Lean, with tart cherry, licorice and mineral aromas and flavors, and fairly light in body, it is big on character and traditonal Pinot style. The wine is quite taut now, but the finish is very long and complex. Should be beautiful with three to five years’ aging.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"So sweet. With sugary tangerine and pineapple flavors and plenty of caramel, it quickly palls.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Barrel-related aromas of caramel, popcorn and baked pear dominate the nose, while the palate brings notes of citrus zest, with lively minerality and cutting acidity.

"Lush fruits of boysenberry, plump raspberry and strawberry mesh with vanilla, nutmeg and allspice on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard off Drum Canyon Road.

"With delicious texture and concentration, this Lake County blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre from the 3,000-foot-high Fore Family Vineyard is intensely good, a deep reddish-purple blueberry-tinged infusion of earth and clove spice with dry, tight tannins and even a little lavender that'll linger. This one'll age, but is so convincingly reminiscent of the Northern Rhône right now, it'll be hard to wait.",US-California-G-S-M
"Features charred and herbal overtones, but otherwise pleasant cherry fruit and a weightiness borne of moderately high alcohol (14%). The fruit fades a bit quickly on the finish, leaving some drying tannins behind, so serve with rare beef or lamb.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Le Pigeonnier, Lagézette's top wine, pushes Malbec to its limits. It's a big wine in all senses, perfumed, tannic with truffle and black fruits alongside a dense, extracted character. It will balance out as it ages, but will always be bold and powerful.",France-Southwest France-Malbec

"A few years in the bottle have nicely mellowed this wine, giving it a soft, smooth mouthfeel. The flavors are of cherries, red and black, perfectly ripe, seasoned with cassis and smoky new oak. Dry and elegant, this Merlot should hold well for five years.",US-California-Merlot

"Erath is now part of the Ste. Michelle Wine Estates portfolio. The white wines, which have long been a strength of the brand, remain fresh and lightly fruity.

The '07 seems to show a bit more textural density than the previous vintage.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris

"In keeping with the voluptuous approachability of the 2007 vintage, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is simply fabulous now for its flood of the ripest, sweetest blackberrries, cherries, cassis and chocolate imaginable. Especially noble is the tannin structure, firm and soft, dry and sweet, a combination of opposites. The depth is vast, and the spicy finish goes on for a long time, suggesting the wine's concentration. Simply a joy to drink, it should develop over many years, but you might want to err on the side of youthfulness and open it by 2015.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Overripe, with raisiny flavors, and hot in alcohol. Tart acidity gives it cut.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This displays the immaculate freshness of all the Eyrie white wines, with an extra serving of phenolic bite. There's a sense of real depth to the gooseberry, grapefruit and pineapple flavors.

"Attractive lemon-flavored citrus character with light acidity. This is a classic, creamy wine with a fresh aftertaste. A drink now wine. Screw cap.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White
"Woody, lightly oxidized aromas of Cream of Wheat and pool water give way to pure wood grain. This feels both resiny and briny, with unabsorbed, raw flavors of barrel oak, salt and sawdust.

It has assertive but polished tannins and nice depth, but it already seems fully developed. Drink 2015–2023.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"It's a pleasure to find a sipping wine that gracefully displays a mix of honeysuckle blossoms, light apple, pear and peach, and a gentle wrap of firming acids. Elegant right through the finish.",US-Washington-Riesling
"For a Grand Cru from Vosne-Romanée, this is a wine on the light side, its tannins soft and dominated by new-wood flavors. That said, it is still a fine wine, packed with ripe fruit and fresh acidity. The structure floats over the fruit; a few months and it may fatten out.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Soft and simple, this has flavors of raspberry and cherry jam and cola, which are slightly compromised by some unripeness. It's not likely to improve with age, so drink up.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"In the mouth, this feels chunky, with sugary red-berry flavors coming in front of a sticky finish. The grape variety is the obscure Prieto Picudo.",Spain-Northern Spain-Rosé
"Overripe and raisiny, with sweet, shriveled blackberry and oak flavors, leading to a hot finish. Drink now.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is intensely perfumed, with soft tannins that are followed by a dry, concentrated character. From the iconic Vesúvio Vineyard, where wines for vintage production are still foot trodden, this has a ripe feel, with tannins that are suitable for medium-term aging.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Dark berry aromas are smoky and stout, and overall this well-oaked Malbec gives off a sense of seriousness on the nose. In the mouth, there's tension but also balance. Flavors of blackberry and cassis are oaky but expressive. It's spicy, a touch resiny and lasting on the finish. Drink through 2019.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Strong in fruit and powerful in oak, made in the popular California style. Impresses with pineapple jam, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors, in a creamy texture. Needs greater complexity and nuance.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A late release from this cool vintage, this wine is 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It explores Cabernet's greener side, with aromas of jalapeño and bell peppers, green herbs and cherry. The tart cherry and pepper flavors are elegantly styled, backed by light baking spice and vanilla accents.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A good Zinfandel, dry and rich in the thick tannins you'd expect off Howell Mountain. The blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors are liberally spiced with pepper. Loses a few points for a certain green herbaceousness.",US-California-Zinfandel
"An almost honeyed nose tells of the 2015 ripeness, but instead leads to a concentrated palate that intriguingly combines peppery spice, savory herbs and rich mellow yeast. All this richness is tempered by a streamlined lemony acidity. This is savory, so make sure to pair it with subtle, expressive food. What a joy.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"Made with 24% Petite Sirah, this dusty, bold and highly structured wine from an historic vineyard site is intensely concentrated and extracted, exuding rich red berry. Cinnamon and black pepper dot the lengthy finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A “wow” wine that will dazzle most Cabernet lovers. It's so rich in blackberries, blueberries, milk chocolate and oaky nougat, it's almost like a candy, except that for all the perceived sweetness, it's dry. The texture is soft enough to drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Forest floor, mature berry, wild herb, clove, smoke and pressed flower aromas come together on this bright red. The taut palate delivers ripe red cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and white pepper set against firm, polished tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Milk chocolate, toast and raspberry aromas are followed by quite sweet fruit flavors. It's unabashed in its easy-drinking appeal.",US-Washington-Merlot
"All varietal, this wine offers aromas of cocoa, fresh herbs, cassis, cranberry and licorice. The flavors are sweet and high octane, with an open finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A good value Cabernet from Argentina? You bet. This one smells like a bowl full of berries touched up with spice, vanilla and leather. It's fresh and ripe in the mouth, with flavors of blackberry jam and nutmeg. Smooth on the finish, it gets things right without pushing the envelope.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A rich, complex, ageable Pinot from this increasingly well-regarded vineyard. It's a big, dark wine, explosive in raspberries, cherries and mocha, but retains a delicacy courtesy of its tannins and acids and some mysterious elegance from the soil. This is easily Guarachi's best Pinot ever, although it's also their most expensive. You get what you pay for. Drink now–2019.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Vanilla, cherry and raspberry flavors are complemented by smoky meat and tar in this softly built, mellow and pensively sweet wine that's ripe and generous in body.",US-California-Zinfandel
"You'll find aromas suggesting weedy underbrush, porcini mushroom, raw oak and dried sage on this bracing wine. The medium-bodied palate shows toast, unripe cherry and star anise alongside extremely astringent tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Wood-influenced aromas set the scene, with the wine's toast character partnered with ripe red fruits and taut acidity. It needs at least three years to balance out.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"A fruity and fragrant selection, with upfront aromas of ripe strawberries, banana and peaches and cream. There's a bit more tension on the palate, with bracing acidity and flavors of small, tart red berries and white cherry.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rosé
"Michael David continues to showcase some of the more unusual grape varieties. This Tannat is big shouldered, rich and decadent, and it tastes brambly, which Zinfandel fans will appreciate. It's full of jammy red fruit and leather notes, with a long finish.",US-California-Tannat
"Light and mostly neutral smelling, with a hint of pear and apple. The palate is zesty, lean and well cut, however the flavors are more pithy and bitter, with orange and nectarine notes. Finishes hot and peppery.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"This tastes dry, though the 12.5 g/L residual sugar does round off the mouthfeel. Powerful, juicy fruit flavors of lemon pith, orange peel, pink grapefruit and white peach abound, with a touch of honey in the finish. Two-thirds was sourced from the excellent Hyland Vineyard.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Oregon Grüner is still a rarity, but deserves a place of honor in the pantheon of emerging white wine grapes grown in the Willamette Valley. Grapefruit and citrus—both flesh and rind—form the core of this tart, mineral-driven wine. Even better on the second day, it remained fresh and focused.",US-Oregon-Grüner Veltliner
"This young Cabernet feels thin and earthy, with little to offer in the way of fruit. Aged in American oak, roughly one third new, it is tart and unyielding.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine's smoke, seaweed, black pepper, orange peel and purple fruit aromas pop. The palate features easy-drinking fruit flavors, with gritty tannins to back them up.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This straightforward wine from the Riboli family portfolio goes down very easy, making it perfect for backyard barbecues. Cherries, dried rose petals and anise greet the nose. The palate isn't too complex, but delivers dark red fruits and pepper spices.",US-California-Zinfandel
"88-90 Barrel sample. Sweet vanilla aroma, fruit that is ripe, soft, fleshy. This seems to have suffered from super-mature, fruit, although a final juiciness does help.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Young and still integrating its lush barrel flavors, this savory Chardonnay should hit its peak in another two or three years. The fruit is full and fleshy, a generous mix of citrus, stone and tropical fruits. Creamy and nicely textural in the mouth, it has the grip and acidity to keep it poised and detailed through a long finish.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Grassy, this opens into pineapple and lemongrass flavors as well as lemon. It's got elysium (code for cat pee), too, but its racing minerality is worth seeking out, the wine simple, clean and balanced.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"What a great Sauvignon Blanc, a fine followup to the 2011. A 100% varietal wine, it's brisk and clean with acidity, along with complex flavors of Meyer lemons, limes, ripe white peaches, honey and a touch of golden mangoes. Only neutral oak was applied, which allows the fruit to star.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of scorched earth, prune and dark cooking spice lead the nose while the mature palate shows raisin, dried berry, leather and a hint of anise. Smooth but fleeting tannins indicate this has seen better days. Drink now.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"A lovely effort from proprietor Raimund Prüm, this plump, creamy-textured spätlese displays ample minerality—there's a distinctly slate-driven note—allied to ripe apple, stone fruit and citrus. Sweet but not overwhelmingly so, this would be terrific with slightly sweet or spicy dishes.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Meaty, plummy and dark, this is very different in character from Two Paddocks' other bottlings. While it's still only medium bodied, it comes across as chunkier and less ethereal. Give it until 2016 or so, then drink it over the following decade.",New Zealand-Central Otago-Pinot Noir
"Here's a nice Dolcetto from Dogliani, the grape's spiritual home. It has a classic varietal fragrance of cherry, licorice and black pepper accompanied by smoky notes. The palate delivers black cherry and white pepper along with chewy tannins. Pair this with mushroom risotto.",Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto
"Primary, light fruit flavors of strawberry touched with herb. Not much else going on in this young, still raw and grapey wine.",US-Washington-Malbec
"Rich and dry, this has flavors of cola, cherry pie, bacon and black pepper. The tannins are firm, and there's a bright burst of citrusy acidity to make things lively. Not an ager, but it should benefit from another year in the cellar.",US-California-Syrah
"With mild white-fruit aromas, dusty notes and a hint of banana, this is appealing up front. In the mouth, it's solid and pure feeling, with freshness and punchy acidity propelling tropical fruit flavors and oak-based vanilla. Oak spice, length and a full body make the finish impressive. 600 cases made.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"Boysenberry, cherry and a touch of minerality take over the nose on this wine from Mike Rennie and Gary Winder, who are pioneering grape growers of the Temecula Valley. Tar and tobacco pair up with bright acidity and smooth oakiness on the palate, making for easy drinking.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A whiff of evergreen lends a cool, alpine touch to white grapefruit and lemon notes on this refreshing, delectably fruity Riesling. The palate is just off dry, bursting with ripe white peach and tangerine flavors. It's satisfyingly quaffable, yet finishes elegantly with a fringe of lime-zest tannins.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Way too oaky. Compromised by the clumsy, heavy application of wood. The caramel and roasted butterscotch aromas and flavors completely swamp whatever wine lies beneath.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This was fermented with 50% whole clusters, which slows down and evens up the process. Along with rich flavors of black raspberry fruit, it's dense with savory herbs and marvelous details of earth and forest floor. Delicious now, but just wait until 2020–2022!",US-Washington-Grenache
"This is a full, luscious and fruity wine, where the tannins linger behind the fruit profile. It has good weight, concentration, and delicate of wood aging. It should be aged longer before drinking, so wait until 2016.",France-Provence-Red Blend
"A little rustic and rough in texture, but otherwise this is a nice, dry wine. It's also pretty fierce in tannins, but offers polished blackberry, cured-meat, pepper and cedar flavors. Could gain in the bottle over the next 4–5 years.",US-California-Red Blend
"Cola, Dr. Pepper, cherry coke all come to mind, as this has a strong emphasis on those flavors, or sassafras as some define them. It's tasty, forward and light, with a lightly herbal aftertaste. Perfectly pleasant, though not showing much depth.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Already showing a touch of bricking at the rim, this tobacco-accented Cabernet is ready to drink. Dried leaf and cedar notes blend easily with red and black currants on the nose and palate, gliding to a smooth, cigar-box finish. It shows more restraint than other Cabernets of the vintage, but still packs in ample weight and power. Drink now–2020.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Tiny percentages of Syrah and Petite Sirah play minor roles in this vineyard-designate. They add to the soft, juicy and focused concentration of big-boned red fruit, cinnamon and tangy, tart acidity.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A small-production offering from the grower-producer, this is a restrained take on the variety, lightly bodied and ripened, with juicy acidity at its core. Cherry, earth and a tension of dried herb complement each other on the palate, before a lengthy finish of white pepper draped in violets closes things out.",US-California-Syrah
"This Merlot remains tight, tannic and acidic. Give it credit for elegant structure, but despite some good cherry fruit, it's still a dour wine.",US-California-Merlot
"This wine is dry and structured, with fresh acidity. It is perfumed by red berry and cherry aromas and an attractive touch of spice. The aftertaste is crisp, light and fruity, ending sweet.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Blending 77% Petite Sirah and 23% Cabernet Sauvignon from a field blend of 80-year-old head-pruned vines, this tiny-production effort is impressively light on its feet, aged in all neutral French oak. An abundance of white pepper jumps from the glass as waves of violet, leather, tobacco and earth surround the rich round palate that is braced in strong underlying acidity.",US-California-Red Blend
"Right from the start, this is all about oak and not about quality fruit, balance or subtlety. Aromas of wood resin, milk chocolate and char lead to a rugged rough palate. Flavors of burnt wood and stewed fruit finish resiny. Year after year, Fagus smells and tastes like this: it's time for a reboot.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"Aromas of menthol, espresso and pressed rose take center stage. The medium-bodied palate shows spiced cranberry, pomegranate, roasted coffee bean, anise and a rather green note of powdered sage. Assertive close-grained tannins clench the finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"The nose on this wine is delicate at first but then opens up quickly into ripe blackberry, marionberry jam, asphalt and grapeseed oil aromas. It's juicy on the palate, with ripe black cherries and wild berries, but clings to a graphite character in the core as well as a bit of espresso-bean bitterness.",US-California-Syrah
"Aromas of scorched earth, leather, mature black fruit and a touch of graphite lead the nose on this full-bodied, straightforward wine. The solid palate offers up plum and dried black cherry alongside astringent tannins that give it a clipped finish.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Clean and proper, if a bit soft and simple. Shows modest cherry-berry flavors with a touch of oak.",US-California-Merlot
"This is a well balanced, ready to drink tawny, showing ripe, mature, wood-aged fruit notes along with raisins and some firm tannins. It's rich while still showing some freshness.",Portugal-Port-Port
"This meaty, ripe Syrah is smoky and deep on the nose, with lusty berry aromas. The palate is tannic but supported by bold, fleshy blackberry flavors backed by maple, vanilla and burnt toast. Caramel richness makes its way onto the finish, which is rocky and tannic but tastes good. This value Syrah was built for grilled meat.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Syrah
"A rich texture and rather ripe fruit flavors make this softer and broader in taste than many of its peers. Flavors like Fuji apple and Bartlett pear are appealing, and the mouthfeel is smooth and easy rather than crisp.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"Lighter in color than other Zins, this juicy and easy-to-drink wine would pair with many everyday dinners. Aromas of red plum and strawberry meet with dried spearmint on the nose, while the dainty palate shows soft cherries and clove spice.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Soft and rich, with vanilla and quince flavors. A very round, open wine, with only a hint of structure.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Different parcels of old vines in the south of the appellation produce a smooth and well-balanced wine. With touches of toast as well as crisp lemon and ripe melon fruits, it is rich and intense with lively, juicy acidity. A generous wine, it is ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This third generation vineyard has produced a classic Cahors, with firm tannins that bring out the black fruits. It is richly structured while keeping fruitiness right to the fore. A wine for rich foods, it will be good to drink from 2018.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"From a site near Annapolis, this wine shows a preponderance of dark grape and cherry flavor interwoven with cinnamon and black peppercorn. Light-bodied and ethereally layered, it has touches of rustic earthiness and leather.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of brioche and caramelized sugar waft amidst apple jelly and quince in this elegantly pétillant Riesling sparkling. It's strikingly brisk, but the mousse feels lavish and comforting. The finish is marked by a meandering salty tang.",Germany-Pfalz-Riesling
"This is a very delicious and accessible wine for all palates, both lavish in style and complex. Candied blackberry, fragrant rose and fennel pollen aromas introduce a palate of baked red fruit, maple syrup and brown sugar flavors. That fruit-forward richness is balanced by extreme floral character and lively acidity.",US-California-Merlot
"Densely tannic, this is a wine that shows some initial austerity, although the black currant fruit and toasty wood then comes through. With its structure and chewy texture, it is always likely to be a firm wine.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Roughly half and half Marsanne and Roussanne, this dry white wine carries a distinctive scent and flavor of honey. It's round and ripe, with lemony fruit. Full-bodied and delicious, this should be enjoyed now through 2018.",US-Oregon-White Blend
"This is lively and tart, suggesting citrus rind, grapefruit and juniper berries. There's a snap to the acidity and some bitterness in the finishing flavors.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"This Pinot Grigio offers aromas of fragrant white flower and citrus zest. Its linear, elegant palate shows tangerine, pear, lemon drop and a hint of crystallized ginger alongside bright acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"This is a rich-textured, full-bodied wine with lots of dark fruit flavors and thick tannins softened by a touch of sweetness. It has a very dark color, strawberry and blackberry aromas and darker, more concentrated flavors including dark chocolate and blueberry.",US-California-Red Blend
"Touches of tangerine decorate a brisk nose that's also redolent with mineral elements of chalk and wet river stone. Flavors of mandarin-orange peels, cut grass and wet cement skip across the tongue, winding into a finish that leaves a menthol-like sensation, though not flavor, on the tongue.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This dark, young wine is brooding. It's hiding itself in a purple velvet cloak, revealing only hints of spicy blackberry fruit and smoked meat. The tannins are chewy, but yielding, like gum. It's a very beautiful wine that will improve for a couple years in the cellar.",US-California-Syrah
"Lime-zesty purity couples with an earthy, almost spicy edge. Pleasantly grippy phenolics speak of ripeness and plentitude while remaining streamlined, straight and long. This has yet to blossom but will be lovely. Drink as of 2017.",Austria-Kamptal-Riesling
"The blend includes 7% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Cabernet Franc. It's tight, herbal and earthy, with a scent of forest floor. As it opens, it adds layers of wild berry, bramble, graphite and leaf, all in good balance. This has lovely proportion and follow through, as in all of the Novelty Hill reds.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Has the luscious tannins and beautiful acids you expect from Napa, and some rich plummy, berry flavors. Also possesses a depth and weight that are appropriate for the price. There's a bit of roughness, though, that detracts.",US-California-Merlot
"A distinctive flavor profile makes this vibrantly fruity and densely textured wine stand out. It packs juicy raspberries, strawberries and dark ripe blackberries into the aroma. All that fruit oozes onto the palate and lingers long on the finish.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Good price for such a lush, likeable Merlot. It's soft and rich in cherries, red currants and licorice. This is easly the best Sebastiani Merlot in many years.",US-California-Merlot
"Damp, foresty earth aromas meet those of cherry and dusty cocoa, which carry to the palate of lightweight red fruit. The balance of smooth tannins and gentle acidity is pleasant, but there is room for more heft and complexity overall in this wine.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Merlot
"This wine is named “the three brothers” after the owner's siblings. It is a tight, mineral-driven wine, although the citrus and apple fruit flavors are not far behind. With acidity and spice, the wine is rich and ready to drink.",France-Provence-Rosé
"The nose is shy but promises development with its heady note of chamomile. The palate reinforces this soothing, herbal and balm-like feeling even more, seemingly dissolving dried chamomile aromas in a sea of fluid, fresh lemon. The palate is absolutely dry and comes with a wonderful lightness of touch. Despite the ripeness of the 2012 vintage this has ease and a spring in its step. This wine is lovely now and will continue to evolve for a long time. Concentration will make sure of that. Drink 2017–2030.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"With a strong undercurrent of bell pepper, this soft Petite Sirah has tense shadings of peppery spice and leather. Ready to drink now.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Old-fashioned Petite Sirah, dark, heavy and hot in alcohol. It tastes overripe, with extracted flavors of raisins and prunes, leading to a bitter finish.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"An interesting blend of fruit from both warm and cool areas, this wine is dry, tannic and complex with flavors of blackberries, currants, cured meats, black pepper and cedar. Good as it is now, it will continue to develop well over the next decade.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"This is an herbal, cool wine. Concentrated citrus flavors percolate through the wine to give freshness and bright acidity. It's light, very crisp and ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Showing a dry character from the wood aging, this spicy wine also has fruit weight. While it is still young, its ripe berry flavors laced with black cherries are right up front. It does have the rounded character of a Beaune and this will develop more strongly. Drink from 2021.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"A delightful bottle with notes of stone fruit, buttered popcorn and toasty spice. It's light in style, displaying both nuance and delicacy, with enough acidity to keep it all in vivid focus.",Canada-British Columbia-Chardonnay
"Lean, dusty red-fruit aromas are redolent of nail polish. A grabby palate is chunky and home to syrupy, cloying flavors of medicinal red fruits. Burnt, rubbery notes characterize the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Tempranillo
"Huge floral intensity opens the bouquet of this Fiano di Avellino, with notes of honeysuckle, rose and jasmine that are followed by accents of citrus, pear and a touch of rubber. The finish is creamy and soft.",Italy-Southern Italy-Fiano
"This offers black currant flavors and firm, stalky tannins. It has acidity, a good juicy character and a dry aftertaste. Drink from 2015.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Crisp red apples and tight fruit skins give this wine a taut, lively character. Just a touch of caramel to broaden the acidity.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Very soft, an unctuous, rounded wine, all charm, rich fruits, soft tannins and ripeness. It's certainly generous, almost opulent, a wine that rolls around the mouth.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Truffle, new leather, wild berry, forest floor and balsamic notes are just some of the aromas you'll find on this fragrant, fantastic red. Fresh and juicy, the palate doles out Marasca cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and pipe tobacco set against a tannic backbone and fresh acidity. It's firmly structured but also boasts balance and elegance. Drink 2023–2043.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Smoke and earth tones accent aromas of pressed apple on this brisk, intensely citrusy Riesling. Lemon-lime flavors are zippy and bright on the palate, but the finish falls a bit short.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Gritty herbal aromas of olive, asphalt and compost announce a cool-vintage wine. This feels raw and massively tannic. Roasted barely ripe plum and berry flavors finish bone dry and pulling.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Ripe and flashy, this Cabernet is a bit rustic now. The vineyard is quite high up in the Mayacamas Mountains, and the flavors show that intense, mountain concentration of blackberries and cherries. Without history to refer to, it's hard to predict this wine's future, but you might consider cellaring it for 6–8 years to see what happens.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This tasty, lightly toasty wine is 100% varietal, with fruit approaching plumpness and offering mixed flavors of cantaloupe, pear and peach. It rolls smoothly into a well-rounded finish with a dash of white pepper.",US-Oregon-Pinot Blanc
"From the Prail region of Alto Adige, this stunning, intense Sauvignon is full of grassy, herbaceous flavors. It is still young, needing time to lose its grapefruit character and ripen into a fine, aromatic wine.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a fancy Syrah, the result of a small crop in this cool vintage. The flavors are concentrated in blackberries, black currants and purple plums, with cured meat and black pepper complexities. Oak adds a lush layer of smoke, vanilla and wood tannins. Complex and delicious now and through 2013.",US-California-Syrah
"This offers that tempting aroma of toasted baguette with a dab of butter, then the flavors flow fresh and peachy, while the texture feels smooth and the body not too full. Well balanced between flavors, acidity and body, it brings refreshment to sip after another.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a dark and probably too-tannic wine. A very dry, extracted character gives bitterness more than fruit. It's still young and has the Saint-Estèphe tannins in abundance, although its future with this dryness is uncertain.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Conventional wisdom is that 2004 was a better Margaret River vintage than 2003, but this wine suffers a bit in comparison to its older sibling. Thankfully, it's still very good, with plentiful cassis and red plum fruit, soft tannins and crisp acids.",Australia-Western Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This full-bodied red opens with aromas of smoke, flint and dark spice. On the structured palate, clove and black pepper add depth to ripe morello cherry while firm close-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018–2028.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"An initial touch of sulfur blows off quickly to reveal stone fruit, fresh cantaloupe and pear. The mouthfeel is lean and not particularly intense.",Italy-Tuscany-Vernaccia
"There's an impressive amount of garrigue packed into this bottling, which is a bit light for the usually very dark grape, as well as touches of sandalwood, cedar and a gamy animal hide aromas. It's zippy on the sip with black raspberry and dark cranberry flavors plus thyme, pepper and sage.",US-California-Tannat
"A blend of three vineyards, this Zin is slightly lighter in color and shows ripe elderberry, Asian plum and exotic cherry as well as chaparral on the nose. Pepper spice hits the palate alongside soy, light coffee and wild raspberry. It's a compelling sipper.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This nicely fruity, fresh wine presents a blend of apple, floral and slightly sweet flavors wrapped in a pleasing texture. Medium bodied, it tastes like a colorful fruit bowl concentrated into one glass.",US-California-White Blend
"As light in color and silky in texture as a Pinot Noir, with refined tannins and a fine burst of acidity. The flavors are characterized by the cherries and raspberries associated with Grenache, along with notes of white pepper, cinnamon, bacon and a floral note. The alcohol is a little too high for comfort or ageability.",US-California-Grenache
"A burst of juicy sweet-tart fruit belies the relatively low alcohol. It's plenty ripe, with a tasty mix of Meyer lemon, pear and peach. It was aged in neutral French oak, and carries the lightest suggestion of toast in the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Massively ripe in pineapples, limes, green apples and lemons, this Sauvignon Blanc is clean and brisk in acidity. It's an upscale, fancy white wine that finishes just a little sweet in jam.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"The producer sources fruit among several appellations for this varietal wine, coaxing a wealth of full-bodied flavor and succulence into its mix of cedar, sage, black cherry and oak. The firm tannin profile provides a structured foundation.",US-California-Merlot
"Black olive, caper, oregano and exotic spice color the nose of this thickly extracted Aglianico. The wine is tight and solid with rock-hard structure and polished tannins. Pair it with black olive tapenade.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"This blend of Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon is soft and ripe, with a good sense of structure and fruitiness. Rounded and with acidity as a counterweight, the wine is ready. Drink now.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
"Very dry and rather tannic, this Merlot strikes off in interesting directions. Along with the usual cherries and blackberries, it shows an array of dried-crushed herb aromas and flavors, such as thyme and sage. This increases balance and complexity, not to mention the wine's versatility at the table.",US-California-Merlot
"A jammy wine it has ripe red berry fruits, soft tannins and a red plum jelly flavor. It will age quickly, so drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of apple, crushed stone and thyme come together on this vibrant white. The medium-bodied palate offers green pear, juicy nectarine, dried herb and flinty mineral alongside lively acidity. A note of bitter almond fills in the finish.",Italy-Central Italy-White Blend
"Thick and concentrated, this robust wine doles out stewed prune, cherry marinated in spirits, chocolate and a confectionary note alongside the burn of evident alcohol. There's a lot heft here but not much vibrancy or balance.",Italy-Southern Italy-Primitivo
"Aromas of ripe red berry, fragrant blue flower, cake spice, menthol and an earthy hint of truffle emerge in the glass. The juicy palate offers fleshy cherry, raspberry, licorice and chopped mint alongside firm, velvety tannins. Drink through 2022.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Aromas of animal hide, rubber and herbal berry fruits are not lovable. This has a heavy scratchy mouthfeel and lightly green flavors of berry fruits mixed with unabsorbed oak. This tastes toasty and blackened on an abrasive finish.",Chile-Rapel Valley-Carmenère
"Coming from McClellan Estate, Anna Marie and Seven Hills vineyards, this wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (61%), Merlot (31%) and Petit Verdot. It springs up with aromas of boysenberry, plum, dried herbs and coffee. The blue fruit flavors are sweet and luscious supported by a soft tannic structure.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This happy blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet and Merlot delivers delicate blueberry nuances and warm toast. It's a wine that flows over the palate, leaving it clean and refreshed.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Light and delicate bubblegum aromas are cut by pink lemonade, a touch of honeydew and a peachy ripeness on this blend of 67% Grenache, 22% Picpoul Blanc, 8% Mourvèdre and 3% Syrah. There is lots of minerality on the sip, with rainy slate and wet cement, as well as rounded watermelon, strawberry and bubblegum flavors, all sliced by lime and tangerine zest.",US-California-Rosé
"Floral and lush, this majority Cabernet Sauvignon contains 10% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot, combining for a structured, layered wine accented in black cherry, cedar and dried herb. From vineyards strewn across the Napa Valley, including mountainside sites, it offers power and finesse and should sit well in cellar through 2022.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is one of Lynmar's most expensive Chardonnays, of their six 2011s. It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Winemaker Scott Klann combines with friend and fellow winemaker Marco Cappelli, the owner of Herbert Vineyard, to craft this celebration of elegant blackberry, jammy fruit, black pepper and licorice. Fine-tuned and elegant, it's also brawny, with substantial mouthfeel and texture.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Fresh and fruity, the wine is ripe, soft and with attractive red berry fruits over acidity. Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon make a happy blend of fruit and gentle structure. Drink now.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
"The flavors are ripe with blackberries and currants in this 100% Cab, and ample new French oak lends a fat, buttery, smoky richness. Yet there's a harsh, scoury mouthfeel that is pronounced. Rich grilled beef will help tame it.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"An earthy Chardonnay, with herb-infused citrus and peach flavors, overlaid with sweet oak. It's soft and a little sweet and ready to drink now.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Slightly eccentric but overall appealing, this bohemian wine offers blackberry, forest fruit and pepper character and a clean, fresh finish. It's an elegant, food-friendly red with a distinctive, expressive flair.",Greece-Nemea-Agiorgitiko
"Here's a ripe and velvety Riserva with luscious, warm tones of dark spice, chocolate, tobacco smoke and root beer. The wine is fresh and crisp in the mouth with firm structure and very good density.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Sweaty, pinched aromas of feline essence and nettle are unusual for Godello. This is fizzy, with flavors of candied green fruits that finish mealy.",Spain-Northern Spain-Godello
"Refreshingly quaffable, this off-dry Riesling juxtaposes juicy, sweet melon and peach flavors with fresh tangerine acidity. The finish is brisk, fringed with a delicious bristle of lime pith.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling

"Pale salmon in color, but quite robust in flavor and alcohol, this brings concentrated flavors of watermelon and raspberries, with all the freshness of the newest vintage. It's bright and focused, the very picture of what is most exciting about these seasonal Northwest rosés.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A warm, southern feeling wine, it has herbs, spice and rich tannins as well as a crisper feel of acidity. Fruity, full of black currant and red berry fruits, forward and ripe. It's not for aging.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Fruity, clean, and on the sweet side, this is an everyday quaffer whose sugary flavors are just fine for a sunny afternoon with ripe peaches or apricots. ItÕs Cailfornia soft, a country style wine that will appeal to those who find some whites tart or sour.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"Basic apple aromas are fresh and clean. This Viura is healthy and clearly defined, but simple all the way through. Lightly pickled citrus flavors finish steady.",Spain-Northern Spain-Viura
"This opens with earthy aromas that recall mature berry, game, baked soil, menthol and leather. The bracing palate offers dark berry, toast, sage, dark cooking spices and a balsamic note alongside youthfully assertive tannins. Drink after 2019.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This is a bit of a disappointing follow-up to the outstanding 2009. It moves past flavors of ripe berry and on to scents and flavors of raisins. Tannins are stiff and drying, and the high alcohol carries heat through the finish. It's a bold style, but drink soon as it's not likely to age.",US-Washington-Grenache
"Dusty, yeasty, waxy apple aromas open this Verdejo, which feels wet and juicy, with scouring acidity. Lemony flavors include a note of orange peel, and the wine finishes tangy and tart.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"Light lemon, honey and banana aromas are puffy and nice. Fresh as it should be, with mineral, lime and just ripening pineapple. Balance, properly acidic but not biting, and likable.  Imported by Steve Miles Selections.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Blue flower, tilled soil, leather, blackberry, licorice and black pepper sensations all come together in this vibrant, straightforward Aglianico. The dense, juicy palate is framed by tightly woven, brooding tannins and a vein of mineral.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"This is a chateau that is getting better and better. This 2009 is packed with sweet fruit, impressive tannins and a complex dark structure. It is fruity, yet powerful, for good aging.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Delicious and exotic, with raspberry, cherry, Mandarin orange, date, cinnamon spice and sweet oak flavors that are deep and long on the finish. Amazing that the alcohol is so low for the ripeness. Could be brisker in acidity, as it feels somewhat melted, which limits ageability, but it's a beauty now with lamb chops.",US-California-Pinot Noir
The aromas of mandarin orange and apricot seem to show a touch of oxygen exposure. This drinks just off dry with stone-fruit flavors throughout.,US-Washington-Riesling
"Hard to imagine greater concentration in a Napa Cabernet than you'll find here. It's just insanely rich in blackberries and blueberries and liberally oaked, while the tannins are hard and potent. Nowhere near ready now, even though it's already more than five years old. Give it at least six years in a good cellar, and it could easily go another decade beyond that.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Horsey plum and pie cherry aromas include a whiff of latex gloves and Band-Aid. This feels rather raw and acidic, with bite. Salty sharp red-fruit flavors finish herbal, with tartaric shear.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Freshly burnt, dark-brown Demerara sugar is a first, intriguing whiff, followed by more conventional notes of yellow plum and fresh lemon. The lemon also dominates the dry, sprightly palate and the moderate finish.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Earthy plum and berry aromas precede a racy, high-acid palate that's fresh and sharp. Snappy red plum and wild berry flavors finish tannic, with oak spice and mild chocolate notes. This is a power-packed wine that will last a long time; drink through 2028.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Tropical, thick and decidedly rich, this wine is both balanced and luxuriously fleshy, with highlights of peach, pineapple, Gravenstein apple and vanilla-kissed caramel. Full bodied, it'll still sing at the table.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Underbrush, prune and a whiff of leather lead the nose. The palate offers raisin, dried black cherry, black pepper and a hint of glazed plum alongside big, round tannins.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"This is a honeyed, sweet wine (a fact not indicated on the label). Spice is surrounded by ripe fruits, apricot and lychee, with added pepper. Some citrus acidity comes through at the end. Drink now.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"This is a bit fat and forward, with flavors of tropical fruit and banana, and a light dusting of cocoa, cinnamon and butterscotch. It's a tasty wine to drink up as soon as possible.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay

"Enclave is Ventisquero Winemaker Felipe Tosso's collaboration with John Duval from Australia. The result is a smoky, oaky Cabernet, with subtle black cherry and cassis aromas that turn more earthy with air. A layered and structured palate is home to flavors of tobacco, chocolate, berry fruits and cassis. On the finish, oak remains out front. Drink through 2022.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Strong aromas of cassis, cocoa nibs, fresh mint sprigs, black currant leaf and licorice are the first things you experience with this wine. After that, the creamy mouth provides loads of black berry, plum and anise flavors that stay through the finish. A firmly structured and well-balanced Bordeaux-style blend.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"While this Pinot is huge in fruit and has a big, heavyweight mouthfeel, somehow it never loses its sense of delicacy and charm. The flavors are the essence of cherries: ripe, sweet and intense. This richness is balanced by the earthiness of a wild mushroom risotto. With brilliant acidity, it's a wonderfully rewarding wine, easily on par with the 2009, perhaps a shade better. The grapes come from the famed Sierra Madre Vineyard.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Pretty oaky, with toothpicky vanilla and charred wood flavors dominating everything else. Underneath is an okay wine, with pineapple and honey flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The most recent of Palliser's Great Dog releases, the 2014 Ted is a full-bodied, muscular wine. Cola, cinnamon and thyme notes mark the nose, while the flavors feature dark cherries and plums, drawing to a lingering close with echoes of mocha and Mexican chocolate. Drink 2020–2028.",New Zealand-Martinborough-Pinot Noir
"Layers of toast, char and dill abound on this oak-driven, full-bodied Chardonnay. There are glimpses of fresh apple and lemon on the palate as well, but they peek through a bit shyly behind a curtain. Further cellaring may help to integrate the oak.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Dark strawberry, rust, tar and sandalwood show on the nose of this bottling, which is still in its infancy despite already being six years old. Bright and booming acidity slices through the sour cherry, cranberry, cedar and pine-resin flavors, framed by tense but not overwhelming tannins. Drink 2019–2031.",US-California-Nebbiolo
"A sweet style of white Port, this is deliciously full of sultana, ripe date and a tang of orange. It's young and fruity, delicious by itself or in a cocktail.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Light and lovely, this has just under 2% residual sugar, but it tastes drier than that. Arresting scents of jasmine tea and honeysuckle give it an enticing floral character. It glides into a soft palate dappled with accents of flowers, oils and incense. Includes small amounts of Chardonnay and Gewürztraminer.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Lots of everything in this wine. Tannins, fruit, oak, acids, minerals, you name it. The result is very rich, but the astringent tannins overwhelm, and will never age out.",US-California-Petit Verdot
"Chocolaty, this fun blend of 56% Zinfandel, 31% Petite Sirah, 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Petit Verdot hails from estate, dry-farmed vineyards. Big, mountainous tannins soften in the glass to reveal juicy notes of dark and red cherry.",US-California-Red Blend

"A little sharp in the mouth, with a bite of citrusy acidity, but the cherry, cola, pomegranate and sandalwood flavors are very rich, and the texture is silky. The acidity could resolve in a few years. Best by 2012 or so.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Very tangy in texture, it has spice from wood aging and a crisply fresh character. It is bright and light, and very lemony at the end.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This smells like citrus and rhubarb more than Malbec, with a tart, herbal palate that's high in acid and short on enjoyability.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Oak, ripe dark-skinned fruit, menthol, grilled herbs and brown cooking spice aromas lead the way. The firm palate offers baked black cherry, vanilla, dark chocolate, espresso and anise accompanied by firm, refined tannins. It's well balanced and already almost accessible.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This stunning, full-bodied wine is in the running as one of the best white wines in Italy. It's perfumed with acacia flower, Spanish broom, beeswax, flint and tree fruit. The delicious palate delivers green apple, Anjou pear and mineral sensations of mesmerizing depth. It will develop even more complexity over time. Drink through 2025.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Carricante
"This is a great Cabernet, blended with a drop of Petit Verdot. It shows the intensity of mountain fruit, with incredibly concentrated black currant and cassis flavors, with superb tannins. Few Cabernets have shown this degree of ageability. Drink now–2024",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Toasty, oaky aromas of graphite, pepper, barrel char and black fruits properly announce a palate of chewy tannins and several layers of blackberry, cassis, barrel-spice, toast and chocolate flavors. Chocolaty depth on the finish only adds to the package. Drink through 2030.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Herbal raspberry and strawberry aromas are raw and a bit green. This feels scratchy as well, with tomatoey flavors of red currant and plum skins. A modest finish is racy in feel but mild in flavor.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This small-production Chard is a real success for J. It's comprised of their best fruit from warmer and cooler parts of the valley.

"Vivacious and juicy blackberry flavors are spiced by cola and root beer on the nose of this annual fund-raising bottling by Raymond Smith, and it also shows a touch of chalk on the nose. River stones and gravel minerality are present on the sip, with fresh black plum, more blackberry and dried mint rounding it out.",US-California-Red Blend
The initial impression is of toast and spice. Only slowly do the fruit and full-bodied richness of this wine become apparent. It comes from a Grand Cru close to Corton-Charlemagne and has similar structure and power. The wine will develop slowly and richly. Drink it from 2020.,France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Intense and tightly wound, this Riesling gradually unfolds layers of white pepper, green plums and Key lime pie. The lingering quince-flavored finish is mouthwateringly crisp but not quite dry. Try with mushroom pasta. Drink now for the youthful fruit or wait a few years for more complexity.",Australia-South Australia-Riesling
"This is a richer style of Sauvignon Blanc, as would be expected from the Daou brothers, but is a fresher style than the last vintage. Aromas of toast, oak and yellow fruit prove quite seductive, and the palate proves grippy with dried lemon peels and cut-grass touches. There's just a hint of smoke on the sip.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Sassoalloro offers good quality for a great price. This vintage is on the ripe side, with aromas of mature berry, maple syrup, resin and leather. Chewy, succulent tannins characterize this plush, fruit-forward Sangiovese.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso

"Made with Italy's popular and historic Falanghina grape and aged on the lees for 14 months, this classic method sparkling wine represents a new turn for southern Italian winemaking that has traditionally shown little interest in bubbles. The results here are promising, with fresh tones of field flower and stone fruit that would pair perfectly with appetizers.",Italy-Southern Italy-Falanghina
"New French oak and lees aging give this wine richness in the form of creamy, yeasty, toast and vanilla flavors.

"Opening with opulent red fruit and soft tannins, this estate-grown Tempranillo has a big presence of tobacco and pepper.

Enjoy with traditional Spanish tapas and meat-laden paella.",US-California-Tempranillo

The mouthfeel is light and fresh, with the mentholated character dominating the red berry core. Drink now.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rosé
"Fermented in stainless steel, then aged in a mix of neutral oak and stainless steel barrels, this offers a crisp, varietally true style with an emphasis on fruit rather than grassy herbs. Honeydew melon, tangerine and peach roll across the tongue, propelled with fresh, juicy, natural acidity. The wine did not go through (nor did it need) malolactic fermentation.

"A rich, oaky wine that will appeal to lots of Chardonnay fans. It's creamy and smooth, with tropical fruit, vanilla and buttered toast flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Januik's reserve blend is 81% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot and 3% Cabernet Franc.

"Yellow and chunky, and definitely on the way toward the grave. Mustardy aromas are severely short on freshness, and the palate is just as flat, dull and mealy as the nose. A weird, low-acid blend of Chardonnay, Viognier and Chenin Blanc.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-White Blend
"Pink-orange in color, this is a tangy, high-acid wine that's not for everyone, given its bracing mix of tangerine and grapefruit. Light-bodied, yet textured, it's a good quaffer and food-friendly companion.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A dark, brooding style of tannic Douro wine. It is lean initially, with a strong mineral character and firm black plum-skin flavors plus leather and tight acidity. When it opens out, this becomes a great value from the Douro.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Tight and crisply fruity, this wine comes from a property in the Vignobles Signé family since 1649. With a strong herbal character, it is refreshing and already delicious, bright and lively. Plenty of acidity keeps this wine packed with forward fruit. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"There's a bright note of wild berry, orange peel and red apple at the very start that fades away quickly to reveal savory tones of cured meat, leather and coffee grounds. It's compact and powerful, but not over the top.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"From the appellation that is at a summit of Loire sweet wines, this golden wine balances intense acidity with intense botrytis and honey flavors. Ripe peaches and pineapples dominate the fruit profile of this concentrated, beautiful wine. It is just approaching its peak, so wait a little longer, until 2018.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"With some richness, this is a drink-now rosé. The initial fresh fruit has diminished, leaving a rounded, caramel-flavored wine without acidity.",France-Provence-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Here's a surprise from Mt. Etna that blew us away. Made by Pietro Caciorgna, this is a delicate and linear wine with pristine aromas of blue flower, delicate forest fruit and black stone. It represents the best of elegant winemaking with that unmistakable blast of volcanic power at the rear.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"A very limited production wine (just two barrels) sourced from the Boushey vineyard, it is rather light but nicely detailed in a cooler vintage. There are notes of leaf and dried herb, tart red fruit, and surprising length overall.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This 100% varietal is blended from a mix of excellent vineyards, principally Candy Mountain. It delivers stiff, tart, elegantly proportioned red fruits, set in a frame of citrus and steel. Barrel aging in one-third new oak adds scents of cedar and spice.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Despite its light color, this is a wine for aging. Even now, the tannins are firm and give a dry texture to its red berry fruit. With acidity as well as structure, it's built for powerful meat dishes. Drink from 2018, when the tannins will have softened further.",France-France Other-Red Blend
"Aromas of underbrush, black fruit, toast and espresso lead the nose on the blend of Sangiovese and 15% Malvasia Nera. The palate is still resting heavily on its oak, showing coffee, coconut, vanilla and mocha, along with dried black cherry, prune and clove. The raspy tannins need to soften up but the fruit richness is already drying up.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Hints of thyme, sage, violet and coffee are just a handful of the nuances that color this composed Bordeaux-style Blend. Brisk acidity balances the bold, ripe fruit, leading to a fresh, herbaceous finish with penetrating tannins. Drink now over a long evening, or better yet, cellar it for 3–5 years to let all of the components come together.",US-New York-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Tightly herbaceous and very crisp, grassy and citrusy, this is the epitome of cool, fresh Sauvignon Blanc. It's a light, bright, easy-drinking wine that's ready to go now.",France-Southwest France-Sauvignon Blanc
"A bright touch of candied strawberry shows prominently on the nose of this bottling, with judicious hints of roasted red pepper, herb and peppercorn hiding behind that vivacious veil. The palate is light in body but has plenty of structure to hold up its cranberry and strawberry flavors and peppery spice. Great with a slight chill.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Coming from an esteemed vineyard best known for its Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine offers beguiling, very varietal aromas of plum, fresh herb and spice. The palate is soft and silky, showing a lot of elegance, with plenty of barrel accents.",US-Washington-Malbec
"A dark, rich, ripe Syrah that defines the California style, and preserves the fine structure that this cool-climate region lends to red wines. The wine is dry and tannic, and the flavors, of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, dark chocolate and sweet, smoky oak, are just delicious. Now and for a few years.",US-California-Syrah
"Ripe, juicy and spicy, this is already surprisingly delicious considering its solid, dark structure. Black fruits burst out, along with a sweet-and-sour character from acidity and ripe fruit flavor. It is also a good wine for aging, so drink through 2022.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"This is a ripe rounded wine, backed by the firm tannins that mark Pommard. It is bold, ripe with plenty of concentrated red fruits and finishing acidity. The wine has a crisp edge that lifts the tannins. Drink from 2023.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"While there are plenty of toast, butter and ginger spice flavors here, this wine also shows the tight, more mineral side of Chassagne-Montrachet. It comes from the acidity and the dry edge of red apple skins. This powerful wine needs 2–3 years for the wood to calm down.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Flors di Uis is a gorgeous white blend of Malvasia Istriana, Friulano and Riesling Renano that opens with a complex bouquet of yellow flower, stone fruit and spice. The mouthfeel is generous and thick with long-lasting floral nuances spread over the finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend
"Almost ready to drink now, this is a rounded, smooth wine with only light tannins but plenty of fruitiness. It's not a big wine, balanced and juicy with attractive fruits. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine shows a classic Washington Malbec profile of green, stemmy herbs, citrus, black pepper and plum along with light barrel accents. It's soft in feel, palate-staining with plum flavors, tart acids and lightly gritty tannins, disclosing blood-orange flavors on the finish.",US-Washington-Malbec
"This is the winery's best Nebula in years. While it's still a little on the soft, sweet side, the cool vintage has resonated in the wine's flavor, giving it a good structure housing cherry, currant and sandalwood flavors. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Rich, generous and packed with fruit, this is a field-blend wine that just bursts from the glass. With a fine balance between tannins and the rich blackberry fruits, the wine is ripe, warm and structured. It is a wine to age, so drink from 2020.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"A tannic, structured wine, full of rich stone fruit flavors, with the acid hints of red berry fruits. It is fragrant and ripe with some depth and intensity.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"For Brut Nature, this has body and weight to it. The nose delivers dry apple and pear aromas, while the palate is fairly full and round for the style, with apple and lime flavors. A finish with roundness and density confirms this Cava's good quality.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Dry, lively and fresh, this wine has an attractively restrained range of flavors that includes lemon, white pepper and herbs. It's thirst-quenching and clean in texture, with a fruit-driven acidity that reverberates on the finish.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This Syrah-Grenache blend is enormously rich, ripe and heady. It wears its 16% abv well, without ever feeling hot or awkward. Instead, fine acidity and firm tannins give the dark chocolate and blackberry jam flavors the balanced lusciousness of Port, without the sweetness.",US-California-Syrah-Grenache
"This lightweight Pinot Noir features high-toned red-fruit aromas and flavors. Strawberry and red cherry notes dominate, but there are hints of coffee and nail polish as well. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"This restrained, medium-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon is a solid value. On the nose, cedar, vanilla and cassis elements blend together easily, while brown sugar and vanilla flavors are supported by just enough cassis and black cherry fruit. Drink now–2028.",Australia-Western Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"First made during the Reagan-Gorbachev years, this blend of 74% Pinot Noir and 26% Chardonnay tastes of hazelnut torte and almond paste, offering richness interwoven with moderate acidity. On the lusherside of the sparkling spectrum, it offers a sweetness of peach, brown sugar and lemon meringue.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Still young, raw and a bit oaky, this well-balanced wine just needs some more time to smooth itself out. All the right elements are there, from the polished fruit to the tangy acids to the toasty oak (slightly more than half is barrel fermented). This is a firm, fruity style, well-made and lively. Best Buy.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"A light copper color and tangy flavors like peach skin and mandarin orange give a lot of personality to this dry, light-bodied, refreshing and well-balanced wine made from old-vine Cinsault grapes.",US-California-Rosé
"Winemaker Fintan du Fresne nails the combination of richness and freshness in this bottling. The nose offers clean lines of wet cement, lemongrass, Gravenstein apple and a slightly exotic spice. Chilled Asian pear flavors kick off the sip, but then comes a buttery, macadamia nut warmth that's hedonistic and delicious.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Light but inviting wood aromas from oak to acacia show on the nose of this bottling, along with red-pear skins, yellow-grapefruit pith and the slightest touch of marshmallow. The sip is more about chalky grip and the tightly woven texture than blunt flavors, with enough sour Key-lime and pink-grapefruit touches to entertain the palate.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A decent Merlot that shows berry and cola fruit flavors, with a touch of oak and beautiful tannins. It's a little hot and funky. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",US-California-Merlot
"Spicy, dry and leafy aromas control the lightweight bouquet. The palate on this wine feels dry and raw, while a buttery oak note supports the herbal, spicy and brambly flavors and the fiery, short finish.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Carmenère
"Ripe aromas of prune, blackberry, marzipan and leather announce a palate tougher than the nose indicates. Plum, cherry, prune and peppery flavors finish baked and loamy, with some heat. This is Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"Shows the impeccably ripe fruitiness and purity that characterize Siduri Pinot Noirs, with the powerful structure of this celebrated vineyard. Dry and fairly tannic, the wine's flavors are of cherry pie filling, red currants, anise liqueur, chocolate and pepper spice. Fabulously hedonistic now, and should slowly build momentum for the next six years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Celebrating 200 years under the same ownership, this ripe, full and fruity wine is all that a Provence rosé should be. It's dry, rounded yet with a great line of red berry acidity. There is just a touch of spice to give a final lift.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Winemaker: Jacques Borman. There's a ton of herbal, earthy tea-like tones to the nose of this wine, supported by notes of black plum, cherry and currant. The palate is smooth upon entry, with satiny tannins and plush, ripe fruit flavors that finish rich and spicy. It's delicious and decadent, though the complexity reigns on the nose as opposed to the palate. It's accessible now, but should hold well through 2022.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Shiraz
"The rich aromas of blackberry, rosemary oil, dried sage, exotic spice and chocolate are impressive and complex. The mouthfeel is soft, enduring, velvety and long-lasting.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"The price of this entry-level cuvée has crept up over the years, but it remains a very good wine at a realistic price point. Crushed stone on the nose leads into dusty cherry flavors with hints of garrigue. Medium-bodied yet refreshing on the finish. Drink now and over the next 6–9 months.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"This wine is put together from multiple vineyard sources, including the well-known Morelli Lane and Widdoes, all farmed by the Duttons. Larger in production than many of the vineyard-designates, it offers baked bread and juicy overtones of cranberry-raspberry layered atop luxuriously toasted oak. It'll show well at the table.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Vento Forte (“strong wind”) sees a year of oak aging to render a smooth, rich feel in the mouth. A pure expression of Vermentino, the wine is redolent of peach, candied lemon and almond blossom.",Italy-Tuscany-Vermentino
"Fruity and dry, with jammy cherry, raspberry, red currant, cola, tobacco and spice flavors and a crisp streak of acidity. Not especially complex, but a tasty, fashionable Pinot that will go well with a great grilled steak.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This off-dry wine with its ripe apple and apricot fruitiness is soft and smooth. From the creamy mousse to the gentle acidity, it is rounded with a touch of spice at the end. Drink now with pâtés or blue cheese.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Fully mature, this light- to medium-bodied wine shows an evolved color, modest cherry fruit and prominent notes of rusty iron and dusty earth. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"Rubbery aromas of pencil eraser, raisin, blueberry and red bell pepper are good but not at the highest level. Chalky and abrupt in feel, this is good on the palate but lacking a bit in flow. Medicinal red-berry flavors finish with sandpaper tannins.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"While this wine has roundness and a ripe, rich character, it is also fresh, aromatic and cut with intense acidity. A touch of honey gives a softer, almost sweeter edge to this otherwise crisp wine. It is still bringing the fruit and the mineral texture together, so drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Still close to ruby in color and flavor, it also tastes young. That gives it freshness, red berry fruits and some tight acidity. Dried sultanas hint at the tawny wood aging. Like all tawnies it is ready to drink.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Dark and crusty on the nose, with cola, raisin and foresty dampness. The palate has wintergreen along with solid black cherry flavors, while accents of pepper and licorice give it a dark side. Finishes a bit grating and tannic, with espresso-like bitterness. Overall it's a good but not overwhelming wine from the hidden Valencia D.O. 70% Tempranillo and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"A structured wine with tannins from wood aging, as well as rich blackberry fruit. The wine has fruit and structural intensity, layering spice and juiciness atop a dry core. Keep for 3–5 years.",France-Loire Valley-Cabernet Franc
"Alan Limmer of Stonecroft was the first modern grower of Syrah in New Zealand, planting his first vines in 1984. While the winery has changed hands, it's still a good source for Syrah. This bottling is appropriately smoky and peppery, with hints of bacon fat and blueberries, and a lingering, softly dusty finish.",New Zealand-Hawke's Bay-Syrah
"The aromas seem to lack clarity, with white flower and orange rind notes struggling to get to the surface. It drinks medium sweet with abundant floral and orange-peel flavors that provide appeal.",US-Washington-Riesling
"This is a balanced, steely white, showing minimal oak and simple layers of apple, pear and vanilla.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A widely distributed wine that'll please in yeasty strawberry and blueberry flavor and a yeasty nose. Soft and straightforward, the tannins are tamed and the profile more juicy than earthy.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Rubbery dark-fruit aromas are surrounded by hints of olive, minerals and spice. This feels round as well as fair and balanced; flavors of loamy blackberry are smooth and come with chocolate notes. Coffee, spice and herbal flavors work the finish.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dark chocolate and cedar merge easily on the nose of this medium- to full-bodied wine. Those dark, oaky elements are balanced by tart berries on the palate, enhanced by barrel char and oodles of soft tannins on the long finish. Drink now–2025.",Australia-Western Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sweet-seeming oak aromas and spicy-sweet oak flavors bring excitement to this full-bodied wine. It smells like cedar and cinnamon, and tastes like blackberry jam on toast. A moderately tannic texture supports all that richness.",US-California-Zinfandel
"The Roussanne really shines in the blend, offering rich, ripe, soft, seductive aromas of peaches and apricots, then folding into a broad midpalate with no rough edges. There is a definite peaches-and-cream feel to the midpalate, and that creamy flavor and texture runs right through a gentle finish.",US-Washington-White Blend
"This Malbec-led blend contains 20% Syrah, but it's the Malbec that drives it. Crisp, toasty aromas of graphite, lemony oak and blackberry are tight and not at all lazy. A massive palate is choppy, with rugged tannins. Baked black-fruit flavors of cassis, mocha, tobacco and chocolate end long and loamy, with unbroken concentration. Drink through 2025.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Three popular grape varieties, Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, are blended to produce an easy, food-friendly wine with pretty berry tones and background renderings of exotic spice.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Packaged in an extremely heavy bottle, this has a muted nose that eventually reveals French oak and menthol. Showing the heat of the vintage, the palate is starting to dry out, offering toast, prune, coffee, raisin and evident alcohol alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"A delicious wine that steers a wonderful path between crisp, mineral acidity and opulent white and yellow fruits. There is a sense of style and poise here, acidity slipping neatly into the ripe fruit. It has aging potential for 5–6 years, probably more.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Made from 100% Touriga Nacional, this is a dark-pink-colored rosé. The fruit is full while also crisp. Extra Brut suggests a dry wine, although in fact the ripeness of the fruit means it is soft and full. This sparkling wine is ready to drink.",Portugal-Lisboa-Touriga Nacional
"This Riserva boasts deep, rich concentration and its oak tones of spice, leather and toasted nut give the wine an opulent, sophisticated twist. There's meaty density here in the form of chewy cherry and long-lasting fruit flavors that are backed by smooth tannins and solid structure.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Certainly intense, dominated by dry botrytis, with the syrup element here in texture rather than taste. The wine has a great tension between richness and intense acidity, a wine with a potential of 15 years aging or more, but for the moment an intense glass of wine.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"Crushed mineral and dried sage aromas belie the intensity of fresh nectarine and apricot flavors in this spry, invigorating wine. Striking acidity lends a delicate, lacy mouthfeel accentuated by a sheen of minerality.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Intense aromas recall forest floor, tobacco, dark berry and grilled herb. The structured palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, black pepper and balsamic notes alongside big, brooding tannins. The warmth of alcohol shows on the midpalate.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Already drinking nicely, this offers generously ripened peach, candied lemon and pineapple fruits. The lush flavors are balanced against fresh, natural acidity, with little or no time in new oak apparent.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay

The wine offers a restrained and sophisticated profile that balances depth with a clean, measured use of oak.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"The nose of this bottling from winemaker Tyler Thomas is simultaneously delicate and voluptuous, with strawberry, plump plum, crushed slate and pepper seasonings. The palate is focused, with fresh red fruit, a rocky structure and strong thyme, marjoram and sage characteristics. Soft and delicious, it finishes with a dried strawberry kick.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a wine with such a wonderful balance of fresh, lemon acidity and sweetness. Its honeyed texture is cut with a mineral bite that gives opulence and structure at the same time. The wine needs long aging so drink from 2017.",Austria-Burgenland-Chardonnay
"The Emerson Block is a one-acre collection of east-west facing rows that debuted as its own wine in 2012. It exudes aromas of violets and lavender, with additional hints of white pepper, grenadine and leather, all within a bright streak of acidity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Pretty good for the price, although in Pinot Noir, the old adage of you-get-what-you-pay-for remains true. It's simple, with a flavor of oak-infused raspberry jam and lots of zesty acidity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Tough and gritty in tannins, this showcases sweet cherry, cola and spice flavors, with a nice earthiness. Not an ager, it needs the richest foods you can pair it with, like steak or game served in rich sauces.",US-California-Merlot
"Herbal and tight, with a whiff of burnt rubber in front of some tart fruit. There is some concentration, and with more bottle age the wine may yet flesh out a bit.",US-Washington-Malbec
"Vibrant aromas of violet, herb, orange peel, smoked meat and plum lead to dense fruit flavors brightened by snappy acidity. It shows uncommon purity and depth that kicks it up a notch, along with enough tannic heft that cellaring will be rewarded. The balance is impeccable.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Sugary notes make this wine remniscent of a lemon-and-lime soda drink. It's oaky, with a bit of heat from unbalanced alcohol. A straightforward, simple wine for drinking now.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Delicate aromas of spring flower and ripe orchard fruit lead the nose. The simple but well-made palate offers mature apple, white peach, lime and a suggestion of bitter almond.",Italy-Central Italy-White Blend
"Here's a charming and fresh Barbera d'Asti with delicious cherry, raspberry and white pepper flavors. It's simple but well made, and is all about easy enjoyment. Pair this with mushroom risotto or hearty pasta dishes.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"Earthy and a touch shy at first, with lightly floral aromas that blend well with the scents of baked plum, prune and blackberry. It's heavy and cheek-grabbing, but also hugely flavorful and loaded with cassis, blackberry, herbs and tobacco. Long as a marathon on the finish. Drink from 2011 through 2014. 1,000 cases made.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a good, dry, somewhat rugged Cabernet, rich in varietal blackberry and black currant flavors with a coating of smoky oak. It's fully ready to drink now. Shows real elegance in the refined mouthfeel, and the spicy finish is a delight.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Layered aromas and rich but vibrant flavors help this medium-bodied wine stand out. It has a medium color with a brickish rim, while aromas suggest black tea and black cherry. A dry, tangy, but ripe fruit expression on the tongue lingers on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Juicy blackberry and black currant coast across a softly layered wine that's approachable and ready to drink, dusted in tannins and dried herbs.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This blend of two types of Garnacha and some Carignan is a consistently top performer from this Catalonian region. This edition smells reedy and spicy, but also like ripe plum and raisin. A generous balanced palate holds flavors of vanilla, plum, cherry and peppery spice. On the finish, this is composed in feel, dry and spicy. Drink through 2019.",Spain-Catalonia-Garnacha
"This Amarone has aromas of rich black fruit and vanilla. The palate shows almost overripe plum and berry flavors, along with oak sensations and toasted notes. You'll also detect a warm midpalate.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Extremely tight and herbal aromas of cut grass, chives, scallions and oregano ride a fascinatingly rainy cement minerality on the nose of this fresh and vibrant bottling. The wet-cement flavors show powerfully on the sip, with lemongrass, wild lime leaves and more mowed-lawn touches.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This tastes a little sweet and a little green and leafy, but there's enough pineapple and orange richness to satisfy. Best of all is the acidity, which is bright and zippy.",US-California-Fumé Blanc
"Good, bright, spicy fruit, with fine balance and a silky, extended finish. There's lovely concentration in the back end, suggesting blackberries and loganberries and plenty of toast.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Yeast, toast and bread dough characterize the austere but complex nose on this finely crafted wine. It’s quite dry, with impressions of earth, mineral, toast, and just the barest hint of lime. Quite full-bodied, it could even improve with a year or so in the bottle.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This wine is made by UC-Santa Cruz astrophysics professor Joe Miller, who's taught wine appreciation for years. Regal and wondrous, the nose conveys concentrated lavender, violets, cedar, oregano, rose petals and patchouli spicing up a grapy frame. The palate offers red fruits laced with clove spice and earth. Ginger, rose water and raspberry emerge in the midpalate, with just enough acidity to carry it through.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"This is a ripe wine, with attractive red-berry flavors and acidity. It has a good sense of structure, solid with balanced tannins and ample acidity. The wine is developing well and should be ready to drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is 100% Cabernet, with the purity that is a recurring hallmark of Rulo's wines. A deep, and deeply satisfying fruit expression, lifted with juicy acidity, brings a mélange of berries, cassis and black cherries into play. The grace notes pile on—smoke, black olive, tar, tobacco leaf, bitter chocolate. Young, bracing, and built to age.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A very soft-textured Cab, unusual for its high-elevation origins, with sweet red fruit and dark plum nestled around a trace of chocolate.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Intensely peppery as well as fruity, this is a tight, crisp wine. It has creamy acidity as well as a more nervy, mineral character that shows a tangy texture at the end.",France-Alsace-Sylvaner
"Sulfur and matchstick on the nose is offputting, while what remains suggests oily green fruits. The palate is sharp and acidic, with green fruit flavors and a sharpness that suggests salad with vinaigrette. Doesn't click, really.",Chile-Curicó Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This revitalized négociant has bottled a fine rosé that's showing its best in 2015. It's deep pink in color, with perfumed aromas of rose petals and cracked pepper. It's ample in body, picking up hints of cardamom, cinnamon, watermelon and red berries on the palate, before finishing long and refreshing. Drink now.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"Already showing some bricking around the rim, this estate-grown Pinot Noir mixes spicy strawberry and some residual fermentation flavors of biscuit and blood. Difficult to know how this one is going to age.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Aromas of yellow peach, melon and fresh straw pave the path on the nose of this wine. The palate takes a surprising turn, with bright, zippy acidity and a bitter, pithy lime flavor that lingers through and lends a light texture to the finish. Drink now–2018.",South Africa-Western Cape-Sauvignon Blanc
"This Pinot is dry in style and tart with acidity, along with flavors of cranberries, cherries, sweet tobacco and oak. Gritty tannins and inconsistently ripened fruit lend this wine a common touch. It's certainly not an ager, but it is an appealing wine to drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"With a suggestion of New Zealand-style grass, this is a widely distributed Sauvignon Blanc with layers of racy acidity that's all in all snappy and cleanly linear. The taste is mostly grapefruit rind, crisply rendered. A great wine to have on hand for large gatherings.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"One of the most ripe, opulent and unctuous of the Anderson Valley wines, this full-bodied bottling smells and tastes like cinnamon, cherries, milk chocolate and brown sugar, but not as sweet as that sounds. The texture is very broad and mouth-coating and the alcohol feels on the high side, giving a feeling of power with polish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"There's a distinct salinity to this Chard, complementing the green apple and hard peach flavors. Notes of sweet lemony citrus linger on the mouthwatering finish.",France-France Other-Chardonnay
"Perfumed plum and red-berry aromas are welcoming. Like most of the Bocopa wines, this is fresh and simple, with easy drinkability. Plum and berry flavors may rank as standard, but this Tempranillo is well executed as well as long and juicy on the finish.",Spain-Levante-Tempranillo
"Give this young, fruity wine a few years in the cellar. The flavors are all primary blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam. The tannins and a touch of espresso bitterness might easily help this Zin develop through 2012.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Smoky and roasted on the nose, it also has standard red-berry aromas lurking in the background. This feels fairly full and healthy, with sweet-oak flavors accenting lightly-pickled-tasting red berry. It finishes a bit herbal, with lasting minty, oaky flavors.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"This wine presents itself initially as having a bold, big body, yet is actually light on its feet as it opens, revealing aromas of cherry liqueur, rhubarb joined with a funk of black licorice and sassafras.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This blend is comprised of all five classic Bordeaux varieties, but unusually, led by Petit Verdot. The wine is inky dark and tannic with extracted blackberry flavors. High alcohol gives it a burn from the midpalate through the finish.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Shea, as always, is a full-bodied, fruit-driven Pinot with a broad midpalate showing blackberry fruit and citrusy acids. It falls away rather quickly, leaving a stony impression, but is missing the concentration of Shea bottlings from other vintners.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Give this dramatic young Pinot time to grow up. It's super-young in jammy cherry, raspberry, licorice, cola and smoky new oak flavors, and while the tannic-acid structure is first-rate, it's a little too unresolved for full enjoyment. Needs at least through the end of 2008 to come together. But should be magnificent, and capable of several years in the cellar.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Rich and robust with berry and currant fruit, this wine is rounded and full-bodied, with tannic weight and spicy layers of toasted oak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
The wine is bright and fruity. It has crisp acidity and a light touch of citrus to go with the lively acidity. Its blend brings out the herbal flavor of Colombard with just a touch of honey from Gros Manseng. Drink now.,France-Southwest France-White Blend

"Blackberry jelly meshes with enticing aromas of hot gingerbread on the nose of this bottling by regional pioneer Gary Eberle. Dark chocolate, coffee, black cherry, loam, crushed herbs and graphite all play into the layered palate, held strongly by firm tannins.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a harmonious mix of firm, extracted tannins and dense fruit. It has a dark, hard edge at this youthful stage, suggesting this is always going to be a wine that is tough. At the same time, it has weight and richness to support the structure.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Vanilla, ripe pear and cinnamon touches appear on the nose of this wine. That cinnamon impression becomes stronger on the palate, where it frames yellow apple and pear fruit. Medium-bodied and dry, it's characterised more by oak than by fruit, with a richly spiced, mellow finish.",Austria-Burgenland-White Blend
"This Tempranillo-Graciano blend opens with rugged aromas of cherry and currant. The palate follows that lead, with choppy, bumpy tannins. Flavors of cherry and berry fruits come with a coating of crusty, blackened oak, holding onto coarseness across the finish. Drink through 2022.",Spain-Central Spain-Red Blend
"Fresh-smelling and generous in flavors, this full-bodied wine tastes like plums and black cherries with hints of dried herbs. A savory, almost meaty quality makes it rather serious and complex in a good way.",US-California-Merlot
"Palmaz has struggled to break into the top ranks, and this 2006 does not advance their cause. It smells funky and vegetal, although it turns fairly rich in the mouth, with cherries, red licorice, cocoa and cedar. Doesn't seem likely to improve over time.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A ripe and fruity wine, it is full of bright red fruits, very soft tannins and juicy acidity. It's just the wine for drinking young, so drink this summer through 2015.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese Red
"The distinctive oak regime at Tardieu-Laurent works better with some wines and in some vintages than others. This Hermitage, from an irregular vintage, has taken to it well, combining muscle and tannin with a rich, luxurious mouthfeel and bold flavors of mulberries, espresso and baking spices. Drink 2020–2030.",France-Rhône Valley-Syrah
"The nonvintage Taittinger cuvée, with its lively mousse, is soft and creamily fruity. While the bottle tasted was young, it had enough ripe white fruits and lime-juice flavors to balance out the freshness. Typically for Taittinger, Chardonnay is an important element in the blend, giving the wine its final mineral tautness.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This 50-50 blend of Inzolia and Catarratto opens with aromas of white flower and honey, followed by a fat, thick palate.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend

"A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from a prominent site, this wine boasts bright, juicy red cassis and pomegranate fruit supported by complex layers of dried herb, coconut and pencil shavings. Ready to enjoy now and through 2021, it finishes with a taste of bittersweet chocolate.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Burnt toast aromas show the youth of this wine. Their tannins dominate, giving a bitter chocolate and coffee character. The fruit is still lost here and needs 3–4 years to come out. An impressive wine for the future.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"This vibrant, savory and linear white offers alluring spring flower and mature orchard fruit scents. On the elegant—almost ethereal—palate, hints of ginger and citrus zest add depth to ripe pear and juicy peach. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors, leaving a crisp finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend
"Two-thirds Pinot Noir and one-third Chardonnay, this aged a decade in bottle on the yeast, before being disgorged in August 2015. Amazingly fresh, it bursts with subtle, well-integrated flavors of citrus rind, peach, almond and pastry. The length and imposing structure suggest it can age for another decade. Drink now through 2025.",US-Oregon-Sparkling Blend
"Strong and punchy in orange, pineapple, peach, apricot and green apple flavors, this unoaked wine has a honeyed sweetness that makes it taste like fruit punch.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

"A flashy, opulent Cabernet. You could even call it sexy. It's so soft and luxurious in blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors. Absolutely delicious by any standard, yet the dry structure maintains elegant balance. Drink soon for youthful drama. Hard to believe production was nearly 72,000 cases.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This beautiful, aromatic wine smells like orange blossoms, tastes rich and fruity, and feels luxuriously smooth and layered. It has a winning combination of ripeness and depth but still has good acidity for balance.",US-California-Viognier
"Girardet's Bush Vine series explores recent plantings of Spanish and Italian varieties. Tempranillo has already proven itself elsewhere in the Umpqua Valley, and this deeply aromatic wine is a promising newcomer. Black raspberries, black cherry, sweet grain and dark chocolate scents and flavors are well-balanced. The fruit is full-bodied and chunky, with a hint of cola.",US-Oregon-Tempranillo
"Exceptionally smooth for such a young wine, this deeply-fruited red blends pretty raspberry and cherry flavors with seductively-delicious milk-chocolaty barrel notes. Happily, there is enough natural acidity to keep it lively and fresh.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"This is a ripe, soft Cabernet, forward in blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. It's a little sweet, but the tannins give it proper support. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Big, friendly and wrapped in a lot of chocolatey oak. The fruit is forward and light, and it is just big enough to hang in there with all the barrel flavors. —P.G.",US-Washington-Merlot
"A dry Vinho Verde that has crisp citrus as well as riper yellow fruits. A blend of Alvarinho with Trajadura, it comes from the north of Vinho Verde. It's perfumed, fresh and crisp while showing a full texture. Drink starting in late 2014.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White
"This is a generous blend of Antão Vaz, Roupeiro and Perrum (aka Pedro Ximenez). It is finely perfumed, full of juicy white fruits that are shot through with lemon juice. This is a wine to drink young and now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese White
"This new Ausonius features a blend of 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Cabernet Franc and 8% Malbec. At first it's rich, smoky, chocolaty and supple; moving toward a Napa style in its breadth and ripeness, but leavening that with Washington's bright acids. Pleasing hints of spice and herb are dappled in, and the wine is almost peppery as it weaves across the palate. The finish is clean and simple, leaving you wishing for just a bit more complexity.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This wine shows grapey and plummy purple fruit notes lead to an earthy palate, with hints of stem and coffee. No new oak was used, but it spent 22 months in barrel prior to bottling.",US-Oregon-Syrah
"A sweetly floral nose wraps around you with the intensity of the Gewürztraminer grape, suggesting orange, perfume and spice. It's sweet enough to serve with a fruit-based dessert, though not sugary in any way.",US-Washington-Gewürztraminer
"The Côa valley is at the remote eastern end of the Douro. The wine revels in its firm, mineral, structured character, with acidity, spice and a dry center. There is weight, richness and the potential for aging.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This big but smooth wine has a seductive spicy, oaky aroma, rich and generous fruit flavors, a good layer of tannin to add mouthfeel and a lingering, delicious finish. The layers of flavor match layers of texture for an irrestible combo. 10% Cabernet Franc and 4% of the Portuguese variety Touriga Nacional contribute to the flavor complexity.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Here's a delightful Montefalco Rosso that's made in an easy-drinking style. It offers upfront raspberry and cherry flavors, with hints of orange peel and black licorice.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"An elegantly structured Sangiovese, this opens with aromas that recall fragrant blue flowers, underbrush, tilled soil, dark berry and a whiff of Mediterranean herb.

"Fairly light aromas of fresh lemon, nectarine, scratched grapefruit skin and a little chalk show on the nose of this crisp bottling. The palate is all about tension and acid-driven freshness, with pear peels and lime rinds making for a slightly sour sip.",US-California-Vermentino
This neutral and mineral-driven Greco offers tones of white stone and dried flowers. The wine is lean and crisp with a thin but refreshing consistency. It would make an excellent companion to spicy Indian or Thai foods.,Italy-Southern Italy-Greco
"This opens with a classic Nebbiolo fragrance of red rose, leather, perfumed wild berries, forest floor and a hint of menthol. On the palate, white pepper, mint, thyme and eucalyptus notes add depth to the mouthwatering wild cherry and ripe raspberry flavors. It's still young, with a firm, tannic backbone balanced with just enough fresh acidity. Drink 2018–2026.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Aromas of blackberry and cured meat give way to flavors of black cherry, dark plums, fennel bulb, lavender, thyme and a hint of smoke. This wine is surprisingly bright considering the depth of flavor and strength of its chewy tannins, with acidity that holds its own right into the orange-zest finish.",Israel-Judean Hills-Red Blend
"This is one of the best balanced and most elegant Zins around. Very fresh in aroma, it's slightly yeasty like freshly fermented wine, and with subtly gorgeous cherry and blackberry flavors layered with light cedar and cocoa spiciness. Not only is the finish lingering, but the wine still tasted great two days after pulling the cork.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Pale orange-salmon colored, this wine has a really soft character. Its flavor is as light as its color: acidity and raspberry fruit in soft focus. Drink this refreshing wine now.",France-Provence-Rosé
"With its firm structure and strongly steely tendencies, this wine will repay aging. Orange citrus is woven into the texture of the wine, showing acidity and a taut, tangy aftertaste. It will need time to come together, so drink from 2018.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Crisp and fresh, this is a soft style of Sauvignon Blanc that brings out pineapple and apricot flavors as much as herbaceousness. A streak of lemon and pink grapefruit acidity is well integrated into the riper fruits. The aftertaste adds bright acidity to the mix.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine is electric pink in color, with notes of strawberry bubblegum and cranberry. It drinks off dry, with watermelon and red fruit flavors that linger on the finish.",US-Washington-Rosé
"Inviting aromas of dark-skinned fruit, blue flower, leather and a whiff of baking spice waft out of the glass. The firm juicy palate offers ripe wild cherry, licorice and hint of charcuterie while assertive, seasoned tannins provide support. Drink through 2021.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Aromas of overripe cherry, vanilla extract, toast and espresso continue to the palate, along with dark chocolate and oak. The palate has rough, astringent wood tannins that gives this a bitter, drying close.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Meaty, herbal and foresty on the nose, all of which are typical aromas for this Salta-bred Malbec. Linear in the mouth and acidic as it tastes exotic due to herbal notes and eucalyptus. On the other hand it's full of blackberry and chocolaty richness. Crisp and nicely built on the finish.",Argentina-Other-Malbec
"This is a dark, deep, big wine that's tannic and dry, with huge stuffing. Packed on the midpalate with blackberry jam, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors, it finishes in a delicious swirl of spices. Defines the modern style of Napa Cabernet: powerful, elegant and impressive. Drink now–2020.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made from vines more than 55 years old, this opens with aromas that recall pressed spring flowers, orchard fruits and beeswax. The delicious, vibrant palate offers juicy white peach, ripe Bartlett pear, nectarine and mineral. It's well balanced, with refreshing acidity. A hazelnut note signals the close.",Italy-Lombardy-Turbiana
"This blend of 60% Syrah, 21% Grenache, 17% Mourvèdre and 2% Petite Sirah pulses with racy red fruit and sizzling acidity. Fiercely tannic, it builds in sweet flavors as it opens, recalling graham cracker, marshmallow and chocolate—a children's treat in a glass. The texture is leathery and wholly satisfying.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"In 1999, Stéphane and Paola Gabard resurrected winemaking at an estate that has belonged to the family since the 18th century. Ripe, rich and still retaining its youthful structure, this concentrated wine will need time. With its dense texture and layers of black-currant fruit, it has a fine future. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A crisp wine that shows why this region east of San Francisco was renowned for Sauvignon Blanc 100 years ago. There's a firm mineral tang to the lemongrass, fig, green melon and papaya flavors, and the finish, while thoroughly dry, has a honeyed richness.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This hits it right in the sweet spot for Chardonnay-loving consumers, with buttered toast, honey and grilled pineapple flavors. It's part of Delicato Family Vineyards' Noble Vines series.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a rich, smooth wine that has ripe fruit and plenty of smooth plum flavors. It has some spice, balanced acidity and a fine dense texture. The wine, with its fresh aftertaste is ready to drink.",Portugal-Port-Port

"A finely judged blend of fruity and savory, the 2006 Parable marries ripe plums with meaty elements as well as hints of coffee and vanilla. It's round in the mouth and cuddly in texture, finishing with the softness of velvet. Drink it over the next five years.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Co-fermented with 5% Viognier, this wine's appealing fresh flower, orange peel, ham hock and black olive tapenade aromas jump out of the glass. The palate is light, tart and sleek, not delivering on all that the aromas suggest but still providing plenty of intrigue.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Plump tree fruits carry the weight, with a dash of toast—though the winery notes say the fermentation was 100% stainless steel. It's delicious and ready to drink, now through 2018.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"This delicious Cabernet Franc shows good varietal character, although it does include 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, which gives the cherry and red currant fruits a deeper note of blackberries. There are hints of wild herbs and black pepper that add to the complexity. What a lovely wine for drinking now, but first give it a good decanting of several hours.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"A dark tint and ripe aromas of blackberry, black plum and leather are appealing and inviting. This is weighty and full-bodied, with blackberry, boysenberry and cassis flavors. There's not a lot of nuance or complexity, but overall this is clean, tasty and generous.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Mint aromas and ripe berry fruit set the scene for an attractive, ageworthy wine. It is still structured with firm tannins and a dense texture, while the blackberry fruitiness is beginning to show well. It will be worth keeping this wine, so drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Deliciously light and herbal, this smooth, creamy wine is bright, poised with black-currant fruits and ripe gooseberry flavors. Drink this wine young, for its great fruit.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Fermented with wild yeast in neutral French oak barrels, this Evergreen Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc opens with a burst of peppery citrus fruit, almost Grüner-like. That spicy note persists throughout the long, sweetly herbal flavor set, blending lemon and lime, pineapple and grapefruit in a harmonious, lively and palate-cleansing crescendo.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"The apricot and star fruit aromas start out quite reticent, with barrel notes providing accents. The vanilla and stone fruit flavors are full in feel and walk together through the finish.",US-Washington-Roussanne
"The tart berry fruit flavors seem etched in place, as they are framed with sleek tannins, bright acidity and a sliver of steel. Aged 16 months in 30% new French oak, this wine seems to be somewhat shuttered, and has the structure to age well. Drink 2016–2024.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"There's a strong dose of green gooseberry in this wine that makes it distinct, although you'll also find riper notes of limes and grapefruits. It's quite dry and crisp with acidity, finishing with mouthwatering tartness.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Peachy aromas are pulpy and lack sizzle. This feels loose and wide, with modest acidity. Dry, peppery flavors are low on fruit, while this feels fleshy on the finish, with mildly bitter citrus notes.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"Morel, the general manager at M. Chapoutier, also has his own label, which includes this very attractive wine from Sign­argues, the southernmost villages appellation of the Côte du Rhône. It's full bodied and ripe without being flabby or unstructured, delivering blueberry and blackberry fruit, peppery spice and a long finish that reverberates with fruit and an espresso note.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Aromas of toasted oak, crushed blue flower, underbrush, espresso, licorice and toasted notes take center stage. There's not much fruit richness here so drink now before it fades.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Evocatively tender notes of Conference pear appear on the nose. The palate is ample with juicy pear and has a generous dollop of residual sweetness. Nonetheless, this is balanced by vigorous lively freshness, leaving a harmonious, rounded, light-footed and elegant wine with a moreish finish.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"The wine abounds with intensity, richness and power as well as mouthwatering freshness. It is very ageworthy and certainly the most impressive wine from Henri Bourgeois, a tour de force of Sauvignon Blanc.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"With a smoked char aftertaste, this wine is lacking in fruit and fairly simple. A weediness could be interpreted as cedar or dried herb, but teeter-totters on the borderline.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"One of the more promising wines coming out of the newer Malibu area, this Cab that is boosted by 10% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc. It shows deep blueberry, black currant and black olive on the nose, along with dill, pepper, spearmint and caramel-laced fudge. The intriguing palate offers black olive, black pepper and dark, deep fruit. It's well structured and tasty, like a salt- and pepper-crusted steak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Located at the base of the Sainte-Victoire mountain, this vineyard, owned by the Dragon family for four generations, has produced a ripe wine, full-bodied and with concentration. It has raspberry flavors and a touch of spice that gives the wine extra richness. Drink this dense wine from late 2017.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Clean and fresh, this Piedmontese white offers lively almond, pear and grapefruit aromas.  Light and even melon and pear flavors with herb accents grace the paalte and the fairly extended finish shows an attractive, slight spiciness.",Italy-Piedmont-Cortese
"Crisp and textured, this is a ripe wine with a core of tight structure. Fruity with its lemon and apple flavors, it has a lightly herbal edge that adds a green, fresh aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Presenting at first as somewhat reduced, this wine is tart and feral, with a muskiness reminiscent of mushroom and forest floor. Its intensely voluptuous body is concentrated in black cherry, cola and cardamom, with a richness and roundness on the palate and finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A rather ripe style of the variable grape, this bottling shows honey, mango and caramelized banana on the nose, proving approachable although very buttery. The palate is a bit flat in acidity and texture, but offers white peach and dried apple flavors.",US-California-Viognier
"This vineyard-designate sparkler shows enormous softness and creaminess, with plush aromas of peach, sweet grapefruit and sweet almond flower.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux-style blend is very rich and ripe in blackberries, cherries and currants. It has smooth tannins, and the finish is dry. It's a fashionable wine that feels plush in the mouth, but young. Give it 3–4 years, but it doesn't seem to have the stuffing for the long haul.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Kandorian makes a stainless-steel version of Sauvignon Blanc, and also this heavily-oaked style, which is about as far in the other direction as possible. It's deep gold, scented with strong whiskey-barrel aromas, and tasting of nut oil and superripe apples, plus plenty of oak.",US-Oregon-Sauvignon Blanc
"Caramel and soft berry fruits characterize this pleasant and fresh wine. It has flavors of red berries along with vanilla  to round it out. Easy Pinot, drink now.",Austria-Thermenregion-Pinot Noir
"This Primitivo opens with inviting peppery aromas, followed by bright fruit and spice overtones, along with a nice bead of acidity throughout. A good pizza and lasagna wine.",US-California-Primitivo
"A dark and richly spicy wine, with penetrating varietal scents of pepper and berry. The wine is tart and youthful, and along with the tangy flavors of berry and spice there is a layer of graphite and a hint of cured meat reaching into the finish. It's sappy, racy and bright, but also layered and showing ageworthy potential. Tannins just hint at green tea.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Apart from a ripe blueberry scent, the nose of this Zwiegelt and Cabernet Sauvignon blend is shy. The palate presents juicy, cinnamon-tinged blackberry and black cherry fruit, with a lovely whisper of white pepper around the edges. A very successful wine for a very ripe vintage, it has the firm tannins of Cabernet to lend appetizing balance to all the juicy fruit.",Austria-Burgenland-Red Blend
"Here's a solid effort from a challenging (cool) vintage. Good, clean red fruit is touched with accents of citrus, tobacco and mocha. It's all in good balance, with ripe tannins and clear varietal character.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Il Groto is an easy blend of red grapes that are native to the Verona area in northern Italy. This is the kind of wine you'll want to pair with informal, home-cooked meat dishes like stew or roast beef. Aromas here include cherry, almond and a touch of sweet vanilla.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
Two samples of this Cabernet were tasted and both are reduced and smell like spray paint. A clampy tannic palate offers stewy black-fruit flavors in front of an overoaked finish. This lacks flow and doesn't seem entirely natural.,Chile-Central Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This blend of 60% Syrah, 30% Grenache and 10% Cinsault is just a bit too confected. Bubble gum, melon and stone-fruit notes are bold and forward, then finish tart and dry.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"This is a lovely wine that very much lives up to the power and thickness associated with Barolo from the Serralunga d'Alba subzone. It opens with big, sweet tones of mature fruit, vanilla spice, dark cola and toasted hazelnut. It feels wonderful in the mouth as well, thanks to the softness and richness of its texture.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A finely structured, still young wine with an edge of austerity. It does have a rich core of red fruit, giving a slightly juicy character, but with its tannins it will always be a firm wine, dense and serious.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Briny citrus aromas come with a mild cheesy accent. In the mouth, this is fresh and clean, with typical rosé Cava flavors of pepper, milk chocolate, plum and cherry. The finish feels a touch clunky but overall this Trepat-based bubbly gets it right.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"This is concentrated and dark in color, with chocolaty berry and plum aromas. A full-bodied, plump and oaky palate houses milk chocolate and herbal blackberry flavors, while a healthy, driving finish with residual oak winds things down.",Chile-Central Valley-Merlot
"Spicy, herbaceous aromas, fresh flavors and a nicely crisp and lightly tannic texture make this medium-bodied wine versatile. It's light enough to drink at lunch or before dinner and it's well-balanced enough to go with lots of different kinds of food. Its name is a nod to super Tuscan wines, since this blend contains Montepulciano and Sangiovese grapes, among others.",US-California-Red Blend
"This is a rich, ripe and tropical white, with a mix of sweetness and salinity that plays well off each other. It becomes simple on the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A soft wine, holding its freshest fruit back. At this stage, it is creamy and rich, hinting at yellow fruits, but still very reticent. Some sulphur remains on the palate but should blow away in the next few months.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Like many of the '07 Hermitages, this isn't a huge wine, but instead shows a nice sense of proportion, marrying hickory smoke with touches of cracked peppercorns, cedar and roasted beef. Drink now–2020.",France-Rhône Valley-Syrah
"Perfumed floral and spice aromas give this wine its great character. It is a rich blend of Viosinho, Alvarinho and Chardonnay, ripe and full of spice, rounded apple and golden-plum flavors and cut with citrus acidity. This fine wine will be better from 2018.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese White
"If this Cava weren't so pickled in smell and taste, it would rate better. As is, it opens with white fruit, vanilla and brine aromas. Flavors of apple and pear maintain a prevalent, pickled edge, while the finish falls off in feel and clarity.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"A big, soft, juicy Petite Sirah filled with rich flavors of melted milk chocolate, blackberry jam, blueberries and peppery spices. Feels voluptuous in the mouth, almost like a liquid dessert, but it's nice and dry on the finish. Good value.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"A ripe and fruity wine, showing touches of wood as well as a more rustic character. It is packed with acidity and black currant flavors, at the core firmly tannic.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Ripe aromas of black cherry and blackberry come with hints of leafy herbs and a shot of alcohol. This four-grape blend is well structured but a touch tannic. Flavors of baked black fruits, herbs and olives finish savory, with plenty of unabsorbed oak.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Red Blend
"While this wine has slightly rustic aromas, the flavor is lively, ripe and bright with good acidity and a thrust of steel that gives minerality. Tight and crisp, the wine will take a while to develop. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A disappointing effort from a normally reliable producer, this wine shows entirely too many rubbery, chemical aromas and flavors. Some decent strawberry and citrus fruit peeks through on the finish, so it may be worth decanting and seeing if that helps.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"Dense berry aromas give this wine a pasty, weighty bouquet. It feels scratchy in the mouth, with plum and red-fruit flavors. This wine runs short on  specifics while offering a juicy feel and a hint of chocolaty young oak on the finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro
"Zesty, grippy, dry and flinty are words that spring to mind for this straight-laced, very zingy white. It shows little more fruit than lime and Meyer lemon right now, but that makes it refreshing and a winner with seafood.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"Aromas of coffee, fig, dried fruit and soy sauce are concentrated on the nose. Earthy flavors on the palate are elevated by these aromas, with a hint of Rooibos tea that gives it lift and intrigue. The tannins are silky and the finish is long with evolving flavors.",US-Virginia-Red Blend
"Easy, toned and fresh, this opens with citrus, peach and honey aromas. The mouthfeel is lean, sharp and brightly acidic.",Italy-Veneto-Pinot Grigio
"The nose does not give much away but the dry palate is all about bright, luminous lemon zest and tart lemon juice. Have this on a hot summer day for ultimate refreshment.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Toasty aromas are not enough to smother the intense, rich and concentrated fruitiness of this powerful wine. Structured and with a firm backbone, it is slow in developing. its brooding dark character still very obvious. However, the fruit is all there, waiting to release the burst of red-berry flavors. Drink from 2022.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"A wisp of smoke accents subtle aromas of lemon and apple on this off-dry Riesling. While diminutive in body, touches of honey give the palate roundness and richness, as well as adding delicate sweetness to flavors of fresh apple and pear.",Germany-Nahe-Riesling
"This crisp wine brings out good flavor depth from the cherry and red-berry fruits. It is concentrated for a simple Beaujolais, ripe and fruity, Drink now.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Coming in an odd tear-drop-shaped bottle with a removable cork cap sealed in wax, this smells a bit hot, with blackberry and dark spice aromas. The palate is framed by big tannins and very strong acidity, offering elderberry flavors.",US-California-Zinfandel
"The 2010 Select is a step ahead of Torii Mor's single vineyard offerings, but holds to the common thread of hard, tart, tight wines with little flesh on their bones. Here the raspberry and strawberry fruit pokes through the herbs and tannins enough to warrant drinking sooner while waiting for the others to (possibly) soften up.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
Cleansing minerality defines this brilliant and luminous Gavi from Northern Italy. It's food-friendly to the core with fresh floral aromas and crisp acidity. Try this beautiful wine with sushi or Mediterranean fish.,Italy-Piedmont-Cortese
"Thunder Mountain wines often display a lot of character and evoke strong responses from our tasters. This ultradark Cabernet is no exception, with its overt heavy toast and black-olive aromas and flavors, heavy extraction, and full, but somewhat astringent, mouthfeel. Through all this it remains compelling, if not presently accessible. Needs five to seven years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fresh herb and leaf notes lend a peppery green edge to this savory smoky Cabernet Sauvignon. Crisp red-cherry and raspberry flavors are tart and cool, marked by a slightly gamy meaty note that would pair especially well with pizza or pasta Bolognese.",US-New York-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This wine's a steal for the price, a no-oak white that's stony, tropical, ripe and simple. It'll serve well at larger gatherings or anytime with friends sitting on the porch or picnic blanket, staying balanced and refreshing in the glass.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Apart from the three regular varieties in this blend, there are three that are rarely found (Arbane, Petit Meslier and Pinot Blanc). It gives a wine that has an very different profile, with nuts and yeast well to the fore and dominating the more citrus fruit flavors. The wine is full, ripe and ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Simple but elegant, with cherry, red currant, pepper and sage flavors wrapped into firm tannins. Has an elegantly silky mouthfeel, like a good Pinot Noir. Drink now.",US-California-Sangiovese
"The cool 2011 vintage has kept this bottling from being as ripe as previous wines from this producer. It's certainly leaner, but for all that, it's dry, silky and elegantly complex in its own way, with dried raspberry, tea and white pepper flavors. It could surprise after 2017.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Notes of grass, lime leaf and garrigue herbs lead the bouquet of this attractive wine, supported by fruity tones of white melon, green plum and citrus peel. The medium-weight mouthfeel is countered by ample acidity and pithy flavors that finish slightly astringent. Drink now.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Chardonnay

"This Poruzots offers a restrained version of Meursault, very structured, its texture severe and tight. Apple skin and green plum fruits go with the dry toast character. Age for a year for more ripe flavors to emerge.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This opens with aromas of sunbaked earth, mature berry, and a hint of grilled herb. The ripe palate delivers dried black cherry, licorice and a hint of coffee while fine-grained tannins give it a firm finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This is a ripe, apple and spiced-pear flavored wine. It has a crisp background that gives a brighter aftertaste. The wine finishes on a note of pepper and acidity. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"Smells and tastes just great, with all the hallmarks of an important Napa Cabernet. It's rich in blackberries, black currants, cassis and minerals. Near- perfect tannins and a tasteful overlay of sweet oak add textural complexity. For all that, the wine feels young and brusque. It wants 6–7 years of age to begin to strut its stuff. Open after 2012.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"You'll find classic Nebbiolo scents of perfumed berry, rose, violet, tilled earth, leather and a hint of game in this striking wine. On the palate, notes of sage, white pepper and clove accent a core of red and black cherry. It's balanced with nervous acidity and gripping tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Dusty in red fruit, like crisp cassis and plum, this is a restrained, elegant and smooth wine from a great site. It shows a complexity of baking spices and cherry compote as it cruises into a lengthy finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Leathery on the tongue, this lovely Merlot, with 7% Cabernet Sauvignon blended in, offers inviting notes of plum and cherry, completely juicy, around firm, strong tannins and balanced acidity. From two separate, rocky blocks on the winery property, this wine is concentrated and smooth. Enjoy through 2021–2025.",US-California-Merlot
"Cherry and clove star in this vineyard-designate from a good vintage, in which the producer again aims low in terms of ripeness. It makes for a somewhat one-dimensional experience once the initial aromas and bite of flavor dissipate on the palate.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A blend from two sites—one in the Sebastopol Hills and the other in the heart of the appellation—this is a high-toned expression of earthiness over fruit, brimming in cardamom and mushroom scents.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Made from Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel, this is one of Rock Wall's drier, lower-alcohol wines. It's high in acidity, with a silky mouthfeel. A little rustic, it shows cherry skin, tobacco and white pepper flavors.",US-California-Red Blend
"Made “without the influence of oak maturation,” and it shows.  A very good, clean, interesting wine with fresh peach and citrus flavors, medium body and pretty floral aromas. Not complicated, but pleasant. Finishes with chalk and a little sweetness.",Australia-Australia Other-Chardonnay
"Balanced and fruity, this ripe, sweet wine delivers both botrytis and generous fruit. It has fine acidity to cut through the richness, giving intense sweetness and a dry core. Drink from 2021.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Acidity and tannins give this dry Cabernet a fine structure, providing the architecture for proper varietal flavors of blackberry and tobacco. It's a nice wine for drinking now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"With superripe flavors of prunes and chocolate-covered raisins, this Cab Franc lacks the cherried gracefulness you want in the variety. It turns porty in the finish, with high alcohol and caramelized brown sugar.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"This smoky wine is showing its wood, with spice and toasty flavors over the red fruits. The wine will balance out to become open and fruity. Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This is a big, bold blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Petite Sirah and 15% Zinfandel that persists in thick, dense tannin and leather and tobacco notes. Full of juicy black fruit and subtle cinnamon and pepper, it finishes clean.",US-California-Red Blend
"This is a touch wheaty and creamy on the nose, with moderate oxidation for a manzanilla. Lemony acidity keeps things tangy and crisp, while the flavors are fresh and nutty, with controlled acidic sharpness. Dry nut notes and an apricot-related tang carry the finish.",Spain-Andalucia-Sherry
"Aromas of rose petals and fresh-hoed earth come to the fore as this wine opens, followed by fine-grained, intense tannins and savory wooded notes. Black pepper, red cherry, sea salt and dried herb pop at different times. It's still tight, so let this wine open in the glass or decant; better yet, cellar through 2023.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This cuvée is a barrel selection, fermented with whole berries and aged in 35% new oak. Simple strawberry and raspberry fruit seems almost weightless, and the quick finish carries a strong streak of bouillon.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This crisp, dry Champagne has citrus fruits and a light, bright texture. Acidity makes its presence felt, giving a tight aftertaste of lemon zest.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Though it's had some extra time in the bottle, the oaky edges of this wine still seem a little rough and tumble. Or maybe it's the banana cream pie flavors—appealing in their way, but opposite end of the spectrum from, say, the minerality of a Chablis. Front loaded, creamy and rich, this has generous amounts of the oak and toast that many consumers crave.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"With an eye for all the commercial sweet-spots, this is a Rosato sparkling wine made primarily with the fragrant Moscato grape (with 15% Malvasia). The wine is sweet in a saccharine, artificial way.",Italy-Piedmont-Sparkling Blend
"Here's a nice everyday drinking wine with some real richness from ripe Chardonnay grapes and a touch of toasty oak. It will satisfy that craving for apple and peach-flavored fruit. Dry and spicy, with the creamy texture of a good wine, but it won't break the bank.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Competent from the start, with well-formed fruity aromas of raspberry and plum. There's even some leather and dried cheese to the nose. In the mouth, it's all about earthy, intense berry fruit and juicy freshness. Finishes a little tart but lively, with good form and feel.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A ripe, open style of wine, giving white fruits, even some peach flavors, with toast and sweetness. There is weight, and a dense texture as well, the acidity lifting the finish.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"While the alcohol is high and the wine powerful, it has managed to retain its linear, structured character. The result is a concentrated wine that also has acidity and a juicy blackberry fruit character. It does need to age, so don't drink before 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of tobacco leaf, wet soil, mature plum, resin and a whiff of barnyard lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The palate offers dried prune layered with notes of chocolate and grilled sage. The fleeting finish closes on a rather bitter note.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"The power of the 2010 vintage is very apparent in this superripe wine. Dominated by rich, perfumed Cabernet Franc, it's concentrated, dark and dense. Its juicy black fruit is still in the background, moving slowly forward as it matures. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A harmonious mix of dry spice, herbal berry and rubbery aromas sets up a full-bodied palate that's brimming with ample oak and firm tannins.

Drink through 2018.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Red Blend

"Notes of thyme, cocoa and broad dark fruit lead to a malleable, medium-full palate. The finish conveys tang and iron.",US-Virginia-Meritage

"Rich, dense and syrupy, but also showing touches of mint and leather on the nose. Quite sticky in the mouth, but with lovely toffee and mocha flavors that set up a finish that runs on and on. Impressive depth of flavor, nice overall balance and a mix of complexity and flat-out richness make this PX a winner.",Spain-Andalucia-Pedro Ximénez
"Pretty good for the price. It's a bit rustic, with edgy tannins and some mint and raisins. But the wine is dry, with good blackberry and mocha flavors.",US-California-Merlot
"This comes from a single vineyard that is owned by several growers but whose fruit is made into a single wine. It is rich, ripe and fruity, a powerful and full-bodied Muscadet. It has spice as well as citrus fruitiness and a rounded texture. Some aging has really improved this wine.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"Quite thin, as if over-cropped, turning the fruit generic. Then it brings in a honey character, as if it were botrytis-affected. But it is not a sweet or late harvest wine; it's quite dry.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"This eclectic mix of 42% Chardonnay, 28% Viognier, 19% Petit Manseng and 11% Pinot Gris smells a bit muddled, bearing notes of peach, apricot and the paper-thin crust of caramelized sugar on a crème brûlée. It feels easy-going and unassuming, lacking some depth, but would be a good wine to pair with honey-glazed grilled chicken.",US-Virginia-White Blend
"This coastal wine hails from two sites, including the Gloria Vineyard in Sebastopol, and Hummingbird Hill in the Petaluma Gap. It stays true to form in its light approach and high-toned acidity. Earthy, light in color and bristling in black tea, cranberry and pomegranate, it's lightly spiced in cardamom.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is the producer's first vintage from this vineyard—the grapes were previously sold. The site, which sits within Green Valley as well as the Sonoma Coast, is planted to the same clone as sister property Quail Hill, in coveted Goldridge soils. Soft, round and decadent, the wine is full bodied, with bursts of red fruit and crushed stone.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Here's a pert Pecorino, with bright citrus and tropical fruit sensations of lemon, tangerine and pineapple. A subtle note of flinty mineral on the close jazzes this up a bit, but overall this is a simple and enjoyable wine to enjoy with everyday fare.",Italy-Central Italy-Pecorino
"Earthy and showing clay, milk chocolate, baked cherry and mocha aromas and flavors, and while the wine feels fairly smooth it doesn't do much but lay there on the palate. Kind of heavy, amorphous and seemingly fading, and overall it's a junior version of Salentein's dying Primum Pinot from 2004.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Pinot Noir
"Tastes simple and fruity-sweet and over-worked, with ripe, jammy black cherry fruit flavors and lots of sweet, caramelized oak. Will appeal to fans of this easy style.",US-California-Meritage
"Exhibiting all the ripeness and richness of an Aloxe-Corton, this wine revels in delicious raspberry fruits, topped with red currant acidity. The wine rolls around the mouth, with a velvet texture on top of some firm tannins. There is a complex sweet and sour aftertaste, as the ripe fruit combines with fresh acidity.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
This wine is almost dry initially. Then sweeter yellow stone fruits come through along with bitter marmalade and pineapple acidity. They make for a wine that is fresh while structured and promising good aging.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Softened by the addition of 13% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc, this wine leads with smoky oak and baked bread aromas, followed by cassis and mocha notes. Medium bodied, with a seamless texture, it adds baked cherry, cedar and tomato leaf components with measured richness.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Yet another example of the increasingly strong crop of rosé wines in recent vintages, this light-pink wine shows puréed strawberry and Big League Chew bubblegum aromas on the appealing nose. It's a lively wine on the palate, thanks to lime zest-powered acidity, with crisp pluot and just-ripe plum flavors as well as a touch more bubblegum.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Lots of personality in this Viognier. It has a meaty fleshiness, in addition to the peach pulp, orange and papaya fruit flavors, with fine acidity that makes it all feel clean and lively in the mouth. An interesting wine to pair with modern pan-Asian-fusion fare.",US-California-Viognier
"Crisp, red hedgerow fruits and wild strawberries add to the acidity in this wine. There is an edge of greenness, but there is also some weight. Certainly not a powerful wine.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay

"Pretty good for the price, with ripe cherry, raspberry and oak flavors. Fine for burgers, pasta with sausages or pork buns. The blend is Cabernet, Merlot and Petite Sirah.",US-California-Red Blend
"This is totally fruit-driven wine. With very fresh citrus acidity, it is as crisp as possible while not losing sight of the potential of its white fruits. There is a delicious steely edge as well as great acidity at the end. The wine is a blend from vineyards planted with 60% Sauvignon blanc, 30% Sémillon and 10% Muscadelle. The estate has been in the Le Grix de la Salle family for 100 years.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This wine starts with aromas that recall farmyard and wet fur; these burn off to reveal leafy underbrush and forest floor. The palate offers dried cherry, blackberry, fennel, tobacco leaf, oak and fennel. It closes on a jumbled note of sugary vanilla and bitterly astringent tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This is a lovely vineyard-designate, brawny and bold and completely floral. Brambly blackberry is met by plum and raisin as a leathery texture provides grit and brawn. Spicy black pepper and cinnamon season the finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Named for a favored surf spot in Mexico, Sayulita is a new project from Balboa. This first release, from the Lefore vineyard, is 58% Cabernet Sauvignon and 42% Syrah, a perfect mix and showcase for the strengths of both.

"Toasted bread crust, citrus and apple are just some of the aromas that characterize this lovely sparkler.

"Very aromatic, showing a complex nose of cherry, spice, smoked and raw meat, and tobacco. The flavors are copious, too, with strong black cherry, licorice and tobacco elements. Balance and structure are beautiful here, and the coffee-chocolate finish has very good length, showing spice and blueberry accents. Lovely already, it will be better in four years and will drink well to 2010.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Solid and tasty, with blackberry, black currant, mocha and oak flavors wrapped into sturdy tannins. Easy to drink with steaks and chops.",US-California-Meritage

"Barrel aromas and flavors of dill, vanilla, cocoa and wood spice are far out front, overwhelming any sense of fruit or variety. The wood completely steals the show.",US-Idaho-Syrah
"More of a Bordeaux-style blend than a straight Cabernet, the remaining 25% includes a mix of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. It's a thin wine, drying and tannic, with dried fruit flavors that lack freshness. Tannins are leafy and finish with a green edge.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Spine-tingling acidity runs throughout this off-dry Riesling. Swathes of honey and fresh apple, saffron and dried berries lend sweetness and warmth, but this striking kabinett does not surrender its sharp edges easily.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling

"At the time of tasting, the nose of this dry white was still quite closed, but its buoyant, almost tropical, expressions of mango, cantaloupe and stone fruit on the palate were already quite irresistible. Penetrating and juicy, it wraps up elegantly with a zesty mineral finish. Drink through 2018 to enjoy its fresh, fruity style.",US-New York-Pinot Gris

"From a vineyard perched above the coastal town of Carpinteria comes this rich and spicy wine, with aromas of red currant, elderberry, crushed thyme, ginger and rose petals. The spicy character carries to the distinctive palate, where rosemary, thyme and lamb-meat savoriness meets with enough red cherry fruit to stay rich.",US-California-Syrah
"It is the balance that stars with this wine. The fruit, acidity and mineral texture are held together in maturing harmony. Still young, the wine is still in the fruity spectrum and yet is very ready to drink now. The acidity and the link between the soft dosage and freshness are all in place. Drink now and until 2026.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend

This has lots of flavor with medium body and without drying tannins and acidity. The winemaker blended in 10% Syrah and 5% Petite Sirah.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"A unique but quite successful blend of 75% Chardonnay, 14% Viognier, 8% Roussanne and 3% Marsanne, this bottling offers light pear cream, cantaloupe and daffodil on the pretty nose.

"Soft yet tannic, this has a brooding quality that suggests it will benefit from some time in the cellar. It shows elaborate flavors of blackberries, plums and cola, with earthy notes of mushrooms and mulch. Good now, after decanting, and should gradually evolve in the bottle over the next 6–8 years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is so toasty and heavily oaked that it smells burnt and acrid. In the mouth this is pinched, tannic and tough. Flavors of plum, raspberry and vanilla finish scratchy and abrasive with drum-like tightness. Drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo

Finishing notes of brown sugar and berry syrup are chocolaty and ensure that this finishes better than it begins.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"Tomato, red fruit and resiny oak aromas don't exactly scream “fresh.” Feels rustic and scratchy, with herbal, sawdust and vanilla flavors clouding out any quality fruit that might exist. Not much here, really.",Chile-Central Valley-Merlot
The red wine from this vineyard (which also produces a white) is firm with layers of toast from wood aging as well as the potential for ripe red fruits. It is going to need some time to lose that spicy flavor that currently dominates the wine. Give it until 2021.,France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Aromatically subtle but ripe notes of yellow pear match the creamy mouthfeel, which has a pleasantly pebbly undertone and soft, almost cushioned acidity.",Austria-Wagram-Donauland-Grüner Veltliner
"Leathery berry aromas are full but young and rudimentary. This feels jumpy and acidic, but that also provides definition and balance to an otherwise ripe young wine. Flavors of black fruits and citric tang play off each other, while the finish deals grippy tannins and black-fruit flavors.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Raisin and baked plum aromas set the stage for a somewhat flat-feeling palate. Plum and berry aromas are chunky and finish soft, with low acidity and not a lot of pop.",Spain-Levante-Monastrell
"A majority varietal, a dying breed in the Napa Valley, this also has 5% Petite Sirah. The combination is dense and syrupy in strawberry and a tightness of oak. Time will soften its edges, and there's already a softness to the tannins that delights, the finish light and lean. Cellar through 2017.",US-California-Charbono

The mouthfeel is lean and fresh and would pair with most seafood-based dishes.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Chardonnay
"This release of Luca Sanjust's monumental Merlot is more subdued than the previous vintage, but what it lacks in intensity it makes up for in elegance.

It's smooth and supple in the mouth.",Italy-Tuscany-Merlot

"The blend is Roussanne, Grenache Blanc and Picpoul Blanc. The wine is bone dry and nicely acidic, with a burst of stony minerality accompanying Meyer lemon, orange rind, subtle green bean, vanilla and white pepper flavors. It's complex but aloof. Don't drink it too cold.",US-California-Rhône-style White Blend
"This Rhône blend from the fashionable west side of Paso Robles is made in the modern cult style. It's very dark in color, full-bodied and glyceriney in the mouth, and delivers a thermonuclear blast of fruit and oak. Among the flavors are roasted blackberries, cassis, melted milk chocolate, anise, cotton candy, vanilla custard, crème brûlée and cinnamon spice. Not exactly your classically dry table wine. Drink now.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend

"With only 56 cases imported, it may be a challenge to track down some of this full-bodied, slightly chunky Pinot Noir. The oak is a little too evident at this early stage, with toast and vanilla notes laying atop deeper notes of black cherries and spice, but give it 2–3 years and it shouldstart to sing.",New Zealand-Central Otago-Pinot Noir
"This has a dense bouquet, with aromas of beet, clove, mint, tomato and berry fruit. The mouthfeel is rich and saturated, with a rawness that didn't exist in prior years. Flavors of mixed herb, earth and savory berry end with a long finish.",Chile-Peumo-Carmenère
"A 100% varietal wine from one vineyard, this wine opens in cinnamon stick and blackberry jam, leading the way to chocolatey leather on the palate offset by tingling acidity. Currant, blueberry and cedar also make appearances atop a full-body and lengthy, concentrated finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This offers aromas of blue flowers, dark berry, coconut and a balsamic note. The warm, forward palate delivers baked plum, ripe cherry, anise and vanilla alongside firm tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A fine bottle — full, fleshy, immediately throwing out dense aromatics with toast and roasted coffee and bitter chocolate components. A deep vein of black cherry and cassis keeps the core tight and focused, and a small splash of Syrah adds the scent of black pepper.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Condensed up front, with aromas of berry compote and molasses. So why is this so tangy and tart in the mouth? Maybe the grapes weren't as ripe as they seem from the nose, and in the end it fails the all-important balance/wholesomeness test.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This has the brawn and power to pair with spicy dished such as turkey spezzatino with mustard cream sauce. The bouquet has an element of natural spice that recalls black pepper, nutmeg and clove. There's more fruit on the palate, especially dried raspberry and currant notes.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Ripe yellow fruit, some apples and a concentrated midpalate present a versatile all-rounder: it's fresh and medium-bodied and has that varietally typical heft of Rotgipfler that gives so much mouthfeel.",Austria-Thermenregion-Rotgipfler
"The wine inside this ridiculously heavy bottle echoes the same grandiose intentions: it's immensely powerful showing some signs of heavy-handed extraction. Black fruits are shot through with touches of pepper because of the alcohol. The wine is ready to drink now—dark, tannic and concentrated.",Portugal-Bairrada-Baga
"Youthful and bouncy right from the get-go. The nose is bright and fruity, with no boundaries to its verve. Lively in the mouth as well, with fresh, forward berry and cherry flavors. A little racy and juvenile, but with lots of high-quality fruit and some aging potential. Drink now through 2011.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend

"A very pale rosé, this wine's delicate aromas of flowers, crushed stone, canteloupe and peach conjure images of summer. The flavors follow in a similar vein, carried by plenty of weight and a long, slightly soft finish. Drink now. 1,000 cases imported.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Dusty, firm, powerful: just a few apt descriptors for this vintage of one of Heathcote's top wines. Mocha, licorice and blackberries feature on the nose, while the palate delivers more of the same—dark fruit, chocolate and plenty of spice. Best after 2020.",Australia-Victoria-Shiraz
"Steely at first sip, and then oaky and midweight, this white reflects the vintage and the region, providing ripe creaminess and plenty of oomph. Made in a heavier style, it remains well-balanced in acidity, with a lengthy, tropical finish.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"From this well-known Carneros vineyard comes this lighter lemon-lime SB with mixed citrus flavors and intense acidity. It's a medium-weight wine with a rather short pineapple finish. It has some creaminess to the mouthfeel, but overall it just doesn't ring the right bells to rate higher. Made by Mia Klein of Etude fame.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is quite an impressive Cab for the price. It's a little rough in texture with edgy tannins, but the blackberry, tobacco and oak flavors are fine.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Leafy, earthy red-berry aromas are backed by a grabby, drying, tannic palate. Lightly herbal black-fruit flavors are followed by dry, rubbery cherry and plum blandness.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"The aromas are driven by freshly cut wood tones, while the palate is full, creamy and oaky. Raw wood and resin flavors are like licking a plank, and the only flavors in this wine besides oak are lanolin and cinnamon.",Chile-Maule Valley-Chardonnay
"Immediately this strikes you as true Verdejo from Rueda. It has pungency on the nose, with accents of cucumber and celery to the primary passion fruit, apricot and citrus aromas. Plenty of zing to it, and tastes of citrus and fresh green apples. Then tangerine and grapefruit carry the finish. Varietally correct.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"Neutral for the most part, but this light-framed white slips in pear, orange and spice notes while maintaining a nice, juicy profile. Nothing more than a refreshing, lime-infused dandy. But what's wrong with that?",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Torrontés
"Licorice and leather aromas give character to smoky yet generic plum and raspberry scents. This feels tight and fresh given its age, with earthy, slightly muddled flavors of raspberry and plum infused with oak and vanilla. On the finish, things seem caught between racy and tired, so drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain-Red Blend
"Despite the low abv, this is a dry rosé, made from 100% Sangiovese that was picked at 20.5 brix.

There's a dusting of baking spices and cocoa, adding welcome highlights to the finish.",US-Oregon-Rosé

Dry apple and pine-needle aromas are punchy on this blend of 80% Grenache Blanc and 20% Macabeo. An uneventful palate is fresh but simple. This wine tastes mostly of bitter grape skins and almond skins. Modest apple and grapefruit notes show on the finish.,Spain-Catalonia-White Blend
"From a vineyard site at the southern end of Oakville, where it touches Yountville, this is a gloriously dusty, smooth and age-worthy wine, bright in crisp red cherry and cranberry while offering deeper, darker elements of licorice and toffee. Concentrated, it's substantial and yet balanced, with something to say on the long finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The best Cara Mia yet, this is Red Mountain Cabernet Franc from the estate vineyard, with 15% Merlot and 8% Petit Verdot included. Stylish and compact, this seems sculpted with pure, vivid purple fruits, balanced against crisp, fine-grained tannins. The depth and concentration are noteworthy.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"This legendary bottling shows all the hallmarks of a young, vital Cabernet that needs plenty of time. It's classically balanced and rich in blackberries, currants and chocolate, with perhaps a bit more tannic structure than in the past, due to the cool vintage. Drink from 2018 and well beyond.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"With its vinicultural eye on New Zealand, this full-bodied and rich wine offers a mouth-filling mix of citrus and tropical fruits.

Modest pear and melon flavors evolve on the palate into bolder honey and bergamot notes on the long finish. Drink now.",France-Rhône Valley-Marsanne
"Puts forth a rich nose with liqueur, vanilla, melon and honey notes. A full mouthfeel is accompanied by apple, spice and smoky elements on the palate.

"Round and fruity, this offers gentle acidity and ripe melon fruit. The wine is ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"Toast, oak, coffee, underbrush and baked plum aromas unfold on this extremely ripe, full-bodied wine. The densely concentrated palate delivers blackberry jam, licorice, oak roasted coffee bean, coconut and a vanilla note alongside astringent tannins. Give the tannins another few years to soften then drink sooner rather than later.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Huge flavors in this creamy wine, exploding in pineapples, limes, kiwi fruit and peaches, with a tangy edge of gooseberry. It's dry and acidic and clean. Tastes a little honey sweet, but the tartness balances.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

"This 100% Sangiovese opens with pretty aromas of iris, violet, dark berry and a blend of cooking spices. On the palate, ground black pepper, anise and espresso accent a core of dried black cherry while tightly knit, assertive tannins provide backup. Drink 2017–2022.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Villa's Seddon vineyard is located in the Awatere Valley—a Marlborough subregion that's generally cooler than the main valley. As a result, this is a slightly lighter, more herbal rendering of Pinot Noir, but one that avoids any overt greenness or astringency. It's complex, elegant and silky—just like more Pinots should be.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"Whether you call the winery Haras or Haras de Pirque, this Character Cabernet is the real deal. It's earthy and round, with almond, moss, blueberry and boysenberry on the well-oaked bouquet. Comes across juicy and ripe, with layered plum, blackberry and black olive flavors. Smooth on the finish, with a dark, mildly herbal salutation.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon

"The wine is unexpectedly perfumed by the addition of Muscat. That gives the wine a full character, including touches of spice and acidity. The wine is unbalanced, the fruit and the spice at odds.",France-Provence-Rosé

"From vines that are up to 70 years old, this is a single-parcel wine. It is rich, with some good concentration and a mineral edge. Ripe apricot and apple fruits are combined with a tight acidity that suggests the need to age. Drink from late 2015.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This wine's flavors maybe take it a step too far into baked apple and pear territory, adding superripe melon to the mix as well. It's full-bodied, silky textured and broad in the mouth, with a touch of warmth on the finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Gris
"The nose is initially rather closed but eventually reveals dark berry, blue flower and brown baking spice. The ripe palate offers mature black cherry, coffee, cocoa, star anise and chopped sage alongside tightly packed tannins. Give this another two or three years to let the tannins unfurl, then enjoy.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Vulcano, in homage to the might Mt. Vesuvius, opens with tight aromas of cola, blackberry, licorice and root beer. The wine is compact and linear with some sharp, brambly elements due to high acidity and tannins.",Italy-Southern Italy-Piedirosso
"This is a great success in a challenging vintage. Dry and silky in the mouth, it's marked by brisk acidity, firm tannins and intricate black-cherry, cola and licorice flavors. It feels really interesting and changes with every sniff and sip. Very nice now, and it will develop over the next six years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The winery's first release of the variety, this wine is sourced from several vineyards, including Sangiacomo Roberts Road in the Petaluma Gap and Sangiacomo Green Acres in Carneros. Orange-blossom aromas wrap around crisp apple and mango while the wine maintains medium weight and bright acidity, the toasted oak subtle.",US-California-Chardonnay
"With a handful of Malbec, this red is spicy in Red Hots-like cinnamon, both on the nose and initial palate. From there, it shows bittersweet tea, dried herb, cedar and forest floor, lightly layered in red fruit as it opens. Approachable, soft and structured, it manages the tannins to be firm and defined.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dense and extracted, this opens with aromas of roasted herbs, leafy underbrush, vanilla and plum cake. The syrupy palate offers blueberry extract and sweet baking spices framed by grippy tannins.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"This wine rises up from the glass with an earthy funk, dried herbs, black pepper, cherry, smoke and mineral, showing complexities and detail. The palate is restrained yet rich, with savory flavors that linger.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"Produced from a mix of clones and vineyard sources, this is a chewy, substantial wine, with dark fruit flavors of plum and black cherry. Light suggestions of coffee, gravel and iron also factor in. It's a rugged, earthy, tannic wine that will be best decanted.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Done in a lighter style, and listed at under 13% alcohol, this is scented with sweet strawberries and tastes like them also, with a soft core of fruit and very gentle tannins. Light streaks of sassafras and chocolate wrap it up.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A rewarding and satisfying Cab. It may not be in the top tier, but it's close, with voluptuous tannins and classically complex Cab flavors of blackcurrants, olives and herbs. Lacks a bit of concentration in the center, but the pedigree is so good, you'll hardly notice over a grilled ribeye steak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Charred, malty, foxy, herbal aromas sound the alarm. This Garnacha-Carignan blend is rough as sandpaper, with heavily oaked flavors of herbaceous black fruits. A rough and rugged finish is abrasive.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Menthol, camphor, pressed violet, crushed herb and toast aromas come together in this wine. The solid, chewy palate delivers crushed raspberry, red cherry, espresso, star anise and toast flavors alongside firm tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Generic berry aromas with a hint of tomato and bramble set this off as a different breed, which it is, considering it's 78% Tannat. The palate has biting tannings and toughness, while the flavors of raspberry and strawberry are snappy. Finishes strange, with pronounced butter and foxiness. Has its positives and negatives.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Well along the aging curve, this feels a bit pushed, with divergent and strong flavors of cherry, plum, licorice, smoke and sweet toast. There's a lot going on, though little sense of the elegance that often typifies Pinot Noir, and the tannins have a rough, rustic quality.",Canada-British Columbia-Pinot Noir
"Notes of waxy lanolin and crushed slate add an earthy, savory tone to ripe, rich orange-marmalade flavors on this juicy little Riesling. Dusty minerality and tart lemon-rind notes extend on the long, bracing finish. Drink now for it's fruity freshness, or hold for 5–7 years at least to allow its minerality to intensify.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Coming from one of the few vineyards between the coastal town of Cambria and Paso Robles, this brooding wine offers dark and dank aromas of black dirt, slate, charred meat and very black cherry. Once sipped, sagebrush and lavender herbals emerge, along with sour cherry. A promising effort for an area that may be its own appellation one day.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a soft, still-young wine. It has nut and yeast flavors that are dominating the ripe white-stone fruits. There is a hint of Chenin honey although, of course, the wine is bone dry. The wine will need to age more and should not be drunk before 2018.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"Greg Graziano blends 81% Sauvignon Blanc and 19% Pinot Grigio for a dynamite combination of tropical guava flavor, bracing acidity, and a pronounced hit of grapefruit on the finish.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This opens with juicy pomegranate and cherry notes before bourbon barrel scents take hold. The midpalate seems to fade, then the flavors return on the finish. Give it another year or two in bottle to pull itself together.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A touch of mineral astringency accents crisp, primary flavors of white peach and melon in this sprightly off-dry Riesling. It's not a complex wine but tart tangerine acidity marks a refreshing finish. Drink now.",Germany-Rheinhessen-Riesling
"This is a bony, tight and herbaceous wine, sharp and crisp with bright apples and lime flavors. Light and full of minerality, it has a steely line that goes to its heart. Drink now, but it will be better in 2015.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Fruity and juicy, this wine has light tannins and red-berry flavors. It is an accessible wine, softly textured, ripe and ready to drink.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese Red
"A generous blend of Alicante Bouschet, Touriga Nacional, Aragonez and Syrah, this is firm with tannins and packed with ripe blackberry fruits. Six months in wood added a toasty character enhancing the complexity and depth of the wine. Drink from 2019.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"The underlying Chardonnay is dry, brisk in acidity and interesting in mineral-driven citrus and tropical fruits. It's also very leesy and creamy, which lends a savory-tart roundness. Drink now–2015.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This 100% varietal wine hails from Canyon Vineyard Ranch and Oasis vineyards. It's tart and puckering with notes of cocoa, raspberries and licorice and a firm squeeze of tannins. Barrel notes of vanilla and dill linger on the finish.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Topped with 18% Malbec, aromas of wood spice, vanilla, pencil lead and dark cherry lead to juicy full-bodied dark-fruit flavors that show a lovely sense of balance, despite the wood being forward. It's a very pretty expression of Cabernet.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A bracing, tart Riesling, quite dry and still under 13% alcohol, this mixes green apples, fresh citrus, pineapple and unusual suggestions of clove and spice. It's a fine follow-up to the winery's excellent 2007 bottling, though perhaps not quite as concentrated.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Floral in aromas and yet darkly savory in cherry and clove, this full-bodied wine holds layered acidity and balanced oak at its core. It hails from one block of the vineyard and spent time in entirely new French oak. Baked raspberry tart finds a happy companion in the richness of maple and velvety tannin. Drink now through 2024.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A tightly structured wine, the entry-level Sancerre from this producer has density and concentration. It also has great fruit, a hint of green asparagus and swathes of lime and lemon balanced by acidity.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a wine to watch as it develops slowly. It is all structure, concentrated and solid. Dense tannins vie with the black-currant fruits from the high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Drink this wine from 2024.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A rich nose of vanilla-bean ice cream, Marcona almond, buttered cornbread and pan-seared pear makes for a very inviting entry to this bottling. The vanilla and caramel flavors extend to the palate, but in a judiciously light way, with candied pecans, baked fruit and honeysuckle flavors, altogether quite delicious.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This wine is a blend of Upland Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (50%), Double Canyon Petit Verdot (38%) and McKinley Springs Malbec. It's aromatically reserved, revealing fresh and dried herbs, green pepper, vanilla, cocoa and dark cherry. The dark fruit flavors show a very pretty combination of richness and restraint.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Smoothness, complexity and a great price are the strong points of this medium-bodied wine. It has wonderful raspberry, cedar and red-cherry flavors, light tannins, a polished feel on the palate and lingering finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Wonderfully complex aromatics show a lovely floral note of fresh violets, married to scents of dusty tannins. Supple purple fruits combine with clove and other spices in a svelte wine with a full spectrum of flavors, from flower to fruit to cocoa powder.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"Seems a bit on the woody side for now, boasting aromas of dark roasted coffee backed by hints of plummy fruit. The cedary, coffee-tinged oak continues on the palate, where it imparts a slightly dry, tannic edge to this otherwise supple, rounded wine. Give it a year or two to see if the oak integrates with time.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"This stand-out Cabernet Franc offers the structure and savory nuance of the Old World, but alongside a palate that's lusciously concentrated with ripe, succulent black fruit. Whiffs of violet and tea leaf reverberate from nose to finish, along with a bold yet velvet frame of tannins. Drinks gorgeously already but should meld in fruit, spice and perfume throughout the next decade.",US-New York-Cabernet Franc
"Made in an immediately appealing, oaky way, this Chard has appealing peach, pear, green apple and honey flavors that taste like they were baked into a pie. Easy to find, with more than a million bottles in circulation.",US-California-Chardonnay
"A deliciously light, fresh rosé, its crisp raspberry flavors enhanced by acidity. The finish is a full burst of fruit salad.",France-Loire Valley-Pinot Noir
"There's a very good wine in here, but the winery has released it far too early, which shifts the burden of cellaring to the buyer. Right now it's all primary fruit, acidity and oak. But the fruit is beautifully layered in tiers of roasted blackberries, grilled cherries and cola, and the oak is splendid. This dry, silky wine desperately needs to be held until at least late 2010, and should drink well through 2014.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Gentle, aromatic notes of ripe apricot appear first, followed by a little smoke. The palate comes in like a clarion call of lemony, brisk, citric freshness. This wine is streamlined and crystal clear, with a defined outline and a stony, concentrated core. With all its power it is muscular but suave and ultraclean.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Made from estate-vineyard fruit, this Merlot is medium bodied, and it has a mix of red fruit flavors, plus grace notes of leaf and mushroom. The finish leaves an impression of dried toast.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Mourvèdre may be the hardest variety to get right in California, but Villicana has succeeded admirably. What you need to know is that the wine is very dry and medium-bodied, and that highish alcohol gives it some heat. But not too much, and the wine really is marked by its complex cherry, red currant, licorice, tobacco and spice flavors.",US-California-Mourvèdre
"This wine will divide aficionados. Some will find it too soft and fruity. Others will marvel at its sheer deliciousness. It's fantastically rich, a wine of deliriously decadent flavors, ranging from blackberry jam and crème de cassis to mocha, blueberry extract and buttered cinnamon toast. Yes, it's soft, but it's the softness of fine velvet. After all that richness, the finish is amazingly dry. Drink over the next few years to enjoy its youthful beauty.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a good yet basic Merlot with baked berry aromas. The mouthfeel is more lively and raw in feel, with modest berry and spice flavors that hit quick and hollow at just as quickly. A standard finish is fine but doesn't evolve.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Merlot
"Made with organically grown Corvina, Rondinella and Molinara grapes, this opens with aromas suggesting black plum, baking spice and a touch of ginger. The vivacious palate shows raspberry jam, clove and white pepper alongside rather assertive tannins. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Lightly charred aromas of coffee, wood smoke and chocolate outweigh berry and plum scents. A tight palate shows firm tannins and carries roasted berry and plum flavors.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Barda is a particular wine with proprietary aromas of light cranberry, pickle brine, dried leaf and especially tomato. A light palate with mild yet rubbery tannins sets up fresh, earthy, briny flavors that end smooth, with salty, herbal aftershocks.",Argentina-Other-Pinot Noir
"This hefty dark Malbec is full on the nose, with aromas of tree bark, cola and muscled-up black fruits. A flush jammy palate tips the scale, while peppery, lightly herbal blackberry flavors simmer with toasty oak in front of a balanced finish that echoes with herbal afternotes. Drink through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"High acidity and modest alcohol combine to make this dry wine crisp and elegant. It's not particularly rich, but has just enough pear and peach flavors to get by.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Toasty and firm, this pure Petit Verdot is rich with black cherry and cassis. Whiffs of smoke and a slight burn in the finish suggest that further bottle age will bring in more barrel nuances (from 40% new American oak) and smooth out the finish.",US-Washington-Petit Verdot
"The wine is full and ripe, generous both in its black fruits and its tannins. It's rich, juicy and packed with berry fruits, a touch of wood and a mineral texture showing at the end. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Smoothly textured with a hint of viscosity, this shows typical apple and hay flavors. Consistent from nose to close, there's nothing wrong here, but it lacks the liveliness a vibrant young Verdejo can show. Drink now. —M.M.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"Crisp, attractive fruit flavors produce a wine that is bright, light, open. There's a good tang of lemon zest accompanying the acidity that comes from the green fruit flavor. Ready to drink.",France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"The famous growers branch out into their own wines with aplomb in this 100% varietal wine, tangoing with a much sought-after grape from their property. Sanguine and gamy, it's structured in good acidity and low oak, showing a succulence of blackberry.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Heavy and globular on the nose, then mulchy, salinic and disjointed for the rest of the ride. Awkward and lemony feeling, with herbal berry flavors, tartness and just not much Pinot pizzazz. A jumbled wine that does not shine.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir
"The powerful flavors of this Syrah are both its strength and weakness. No question it's a delicious wine, upfront in blackberry pie filling, currant, licorice, dark chocolate and peppery spices. However the very power of flavor makes it hard to pair with subtle food. Best with strong plates, like short ribs or beef tamales.",US-California-Syrah
"This is a big, intense wine that just lacks a bit of complexity and nuance. Bold blackberry fruit is framed by vanilla- and coffee-laden oak in this bruiser best suited to partnering a slab of prime porterhouse.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"This mild, plump and basic Chardonnay leads with peach blossom, yeast and cured ham scents. Its melon, peach and apricot flavors hollow out on a mild, yeasty tasting finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Chardonnay
"Villa Maria's entry-level Sauvignon Blanc remains a solid bargain year after year. Delicate leafy notes provide lift to gooseberry and pineapple flavors. It's a very good, fruit-driven introduction to the regional style at a fair price.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Strawberry jam and red cherries meet vanilla and nutmeg in this fresh, fruity but also complex wine. It is medium-bodied and just slightly tannic in the texture, which is a good thing. It has a great sense of harmony that lasts through the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Anderson Valley has always been a hospitable home to Pinot Gris and this 100% tank-fermented, no-malolactic-fermentation beauty is fragrant in orange blossom and honeysuckle, a tangible streak of wet stone zipping throughout. Steely, it settles into apricot and guava before ending with another bite of acidity. A perfect sipping wine, it's also ready for oysters.",US-California-Pinot Gris
"The vineyard is in the cooler Green Valley, although you wouldn't know it from the label. The wine shows considerable crispness and dryness, with moderate alcohol. There are some tabasco and balsam notes grounding the richer cherry and sandalwood flavors. It's enormously elegant, a smooth, complex, silky Pinot Noir that should develop through the next six years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
This is a good reminder that Touriga Nacional comes from originally from the Dão. The wine has power and dense tannins while also having a strongly textured character that shows up the granite soil of the region. The wine is just maturing and will be at its best from 2017.,Portugal-Dão-Touriga Nacional
"Pricey, but it's a very good Sauvignon Blanc. You can tell right away that it's pedigreed, from the perfumed aroma to the complex flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, sweet hay, vanilla, toast and white pepper. With a dry finish, it's versatile across a range of foods.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Plump black raspberry and blackberry notes mix with vanilla and baked licorice on the fruit-driven nose of this blend of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Syrah. The tannic tension and strong acidity of the palate overwhelms the flavors at first, eventually revealing dark purple fruit and a vanilla-laced finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"Pretty aromas suggest violet, sandalwood, incense, plum and chocolate. The ripe palate offers crushed black cherry, mocha, espresso and vanilla alongside firm tannins. A licorice note signals the close.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This crisp wine is packed with acidity and fruitiness. It is tangy, tight, full of attractive acidity as well as lively citrus and white fruits. It is ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"From multiple vineyard sites in the appellation, this wine is a tremendous value, offering vibrancy and complexity in an approachable way. The entry is marked by candied raspberry and strawberry, with hits of cinnamon and earth. Soft and easygoing, it ends in a rustic knot of tight tannin that resolves in the glass.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The blend is Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Grenache and Syrah. The wine is dry, hot in alcohol and overripe, with raisin, prune and chocolate flavors.",US-California-Red Blend
"Dried apricot, jasmine, flower, herb and peach aromas are followed by medium, sweet fruit flavors that can't quite sustain their intensity but still bring appeal.",US-Washington-Riesling
This dense wine has ripe tannins and generous fruits. Its black-fruit flavors are full of spice and acidity with a crisp texture. Drink this wine from 2018.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"On first take, this is oily and smells of bitter almond and walnut. The mouthfeel is clunky and heavy, with low acidity. Bitterness is the lead flavor, and then honey and brown sugar enter the picture. On the finish it struggles to drive through the tape.",Spain-Andalucia-Moscatel
"In this heavy wine, stewy, baked aromas of raisin and prune are smothered in oak. On the palate, there's a reverb of oak and baked black-fruit flavors, while the finish feels and tastes resiny.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"A touch of flinty reduction clings to the nose but soon relaxes into soft notes of ripe black cherry. The palate is textured and dry, harmonious with fruit and the gentle ripple and crunch of slightly rustic but utterly pleasant tannins. This seems to be its perfect drinking window now: generous with fruit, utterly harmonious and starting to mellow. The finish is fresh, clean and totally moreish. If you can resist at all, this may well continue to develop. Drink now through 2025.",France-Alsace-Pinot Noir
"Sweet tannins wrap around a robust flavor profile of plum, cherry and leather saddle in this vineyard-designated wine. Softly textured, it remains generous in oak and power as it winds to a finish dusted in black pepper and tobacco.",US-California-Merlot
"What a bargain in a fine Chardonnay. There is a hint of vanilla, flavors of pears, apples and melons and a rich mouthfeel, perfectly balanced by ample acidity. Should be easy to find, with 15,000 cases produced. From Delicato.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Light and fruity, this has red fruit flavors that are tempered with soft, perfumed tannins and balancing acidity. Some sweetness shows through toward the finish. Ready to drink now.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Here's a soft ripasso, with aromas of plum, raisin and menthol. The round palate offers plum, prune, black licorice and chocolate sensations. There's not much complexity here, but it's very enjoyable.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Filled with scents and flavors of black earth, cedar and dark fruit, this impressively full-bodied wine demands to be served with something similarly big and meaty. Despite its size, it's open-knit and accessible, with just enough coarse tannins on the finish to cut the richness of beef steaks or braises.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz-Viognier
"The core of the “K” range, this wine shows its wood and tannins right up front. It's certainly powerful, with a sense of concentrated black fruits behind the firm and dry structure. A dark and brooding wine, this has enormous potential, so give it at least six years.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
A good amount of sweetness fills the profile of this superjammy-smelling and thick-tasting wine. Aromas suggest dark raisins and prunes; the flavors are equally overripe with vanilla and maple accents. The texture is soft and unctuous.,US-California-Red Blend
"Red berry, violet, leather and crushed culinary herb aromas unfold in this ripe and rounded wine. The palate offers juicy red cherry, star anise and ground sage flavors alongside solid, seasoned tannins. It's already surprisingly accessible. Drink 2018–2027.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Entirely varietal, this Roussanne was whole-cluster fermented and is intense in its mushroomy, woodsy richness and layers of complexity and depth. With a lingering mineral finish, a fine case study in Roussanne's ability to stand out on its own.",US-California-Roussanne
This off-dry Riesling offers an abundance of juicy lemon and green apple refreshment. It's approachable and fresh with a lingering sweetness that's not at all cloying. The finish is brisk and clean.,Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"A fine Chardonnay, front-loaded with tropical fruit, Asian pear, and green apple flavors, with rich honey and vanilla from charred oak barrels. With a crunch of acidity, it's Trefethen's best Chardonnay in years.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Still a very young wine, Londer's Paraboll is leathery and herbal, marked by swirls of bright cranberry and rhubarb flavor. With a full, silky mouthfeel and long finish, it's one of the best of their 2010s to seek out. This should gain complexity with a few years more of age.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine has structure and concentration, but is less generous in terms of its aromas. There are evident notes of ripe cherry, leather, vanilla and some tobacco, but they never come into full bloom. The tannins are gritty and still a bit raw and the wine offers sour cherry flavors in the mouth.",Italy-Tuscany-Prugnolo Gentile
"Rubbery, medicinal aromas suggest iodine and latex. This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is heavy and flabby, with baked, herbal flavors that finish saucy and show notes of tomato and fennel.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend

"A dark bruiser with heavy mocha, chocolate, tobacco, cola and crusty leather aromas in addition to massive fruit scents. It's huge in the mouth, with broad, grabby tannins, pumped-up acids and wide berry, vanilla and coconut flavors. Dark like coffee on the finish, with titanic tannins and foundation. Best from 2013 through 2016.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro

"This is beautifully aromatic and assertively tannic, with monster fruit that overtakes the 100% new oak and shows no hint of heat from the 15.5% alcohol. It's big, yet graceful, with veins of smoke and rock wrapped around the dense cassis and berry fruit. Young as it is, this has immense concentration and depth.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"A blend of fruit from Dineen, Meek and Sheridan vineyards, this wine delivers aromas of black cherry, orange peel, sweet spices and fresh herbs. The black cherry flavors convey polish and depth.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Mossy and inky in smell, this has a firm palate. Flavors of berry, herb and chocolate set up a dry finish, with structure and background complexities. Spicy and herbal, it has a Chilean sort of character.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Tropical fruit aromas come with notes of bath soap and white-flower blossom. This is easygoing and healthy on the palate, with just enough snappy acidity. Flavors of lime and green banana run long on the finish, which shows a touch of the variety's patented oily bitterness. Drink immediately.",Argentina-Other-Torrontés
"Impressively crafted from 20-plus-year-old vines, thus the Heritage tag, this blend of mostly Zin with 20% Petite Sirah and 1% Primitivo is like Sunday brunch. It offers a study in bacon and strawberries laced in syrup, a thick, leathery wine that finishes balanced and just shy of over-decadent.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A pale copper color, this offers initial aromas of ripe peach, pineapple core and ripe strawberry, providing a lushly fruity impression on the nose. The palate offers subtle structure and ample acidity to carry the ripe fruit tones, with a subtle peppery spice that dances on the finish.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rosé
"This pure Syrah from Reininger's estate vineyard has the focus and also the tightness that often characterize single-vineyard wines. There are dense flavors of cranberry and pomegranate, plenty of natural acid, along with polished tannins and a soothing layer of toasty oak, that helps smooth the rough edges and buff up the finish. Hints of earth, leaf and tar add detail and interest all the way through a lingering finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"This blend of 40% Malbec, 30% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon opens with ripe blackberry, underbrush and cedar aromas. Concentrated and juicy, the palate doles out black currant, bilberry, mint and licorice flavors, framed by chewy tannins. Drink through 2025.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"Perfumed, bold and brambly, this is a full-bodied and fairly-priced rendition of the variety that's big in cherry cola flavor, earthy mint and oak.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Made from very ripe grapes harvested as late as November, this Grüner shows us depth despite its light, fresh palate. Creamy notes of yellow plum have the softest touch of vanilla. This has a pliable, sinuous body and is a more thoughtful, rounded but still very fresh rendition of this enduring Austrian favorite.",Austria-Burgenland-Grüner Veltliner
"Medium-intense aromas of black plum, cherry and berry are upfront on the nose of this ripe wine, with supporting notes of woodspice, char and black pepper for added depth. The tannins are structured yet fine, with a firm hold and rich, grippy fruit-skin flavors that carry the close.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rhône-style Red Blend
"The blend is almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, with some Carmenet and Petit Verdot blended in for complexity. The wine is easy to like now for its dryness and elegance, despite relatively high alcohol. It shows California ripeness of fruit, with a smooth integration of oak. If there's a criticism, it's excessive softness. Drink up.",US-California-Red Blend
"A little jagged around the edges, with some harsh tannins surrounding riper notes of blackberries and tobacco. Could develop bottle nuances in a few years.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Dark, mossy, rubbery blackberry aromas are solid. In the mouth, this is punishing, with raw tannins that suggest grapeskins. Dark, chocolaty, savory, spicy flavors of blackberry and black plum finish toasty but bumpy, tannic and rubbery.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Though the alcohol lists at 14.3%, this seems thin and flat. There's little depth to the one-dimensional, green fruit flavors, a hint of plastic and some burn in the finish.",US-Oregon-Viognier
"Ripe plum, cranberry, pressed violet, tobacco and damp soil aromas lead the nose, along with a whiff of clove. The round, polished palate offers dried black cherry, prune, raspberry jam and licorice notes, alongside smooth tannins. It's already extremely approachable, so drink soon.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"Unusual for a 2003 Cab to be held back this long before release. Maybe they thought the tannins were too strong. They're fully resolved now, but the fruit has faded, leaving behind mild flavors of dried cherries, currants and herbs that finish very dry. It's an elegant wine, rather than a voluptuous one.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Gigondas is Meffre's home turf, and this cuvée is impressive, boasting ample weight, rich tannins and massive extraction. It's dense and dark, combining asphalt, coffee, chocolate and licorice with black cherry preserves.

"With its orange-pink color, this rosé is showing the good results of nearly a year's bottle age. That has filled out the fresh red fruits and given the lively texture a touch of toast.

As with its white counterpart, this Cuvée de Moins Brut is designed as a food wine.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend

"Squeezed lemon rinds and a faint whiff of petrol show on an otherwise reluctant nose from this off-dry wine.

"Layers of spice, lanolin and orange rind stand out curiously on this intriguing Riesling fermented spontaneously with indigenous yeast, and subject to 5 months on its lees. It's strikingly brisk with tart, lemony acidity, but rich with a rustic, savory apple flavor. It's a funky, thoroughly unique wine, but also a remarkably complex wine to savor through the course of a long evening.",US-New York-Riesling

"Vanilla and green wood aromas are at the fore, followed by cherry and herbs. The fruit flavors are sweet and elegant, with the oak nearly completely overriding them.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Already showing a bit of bricking, this is a full-bodied Shiraz that's a bit coarse in texture, with aromas and flavors of plum and brown sugar. The finish matches tart, zingy fruit with sweet, molasses-tinged oak. The individual components show promise, but it's tough to say if they will all come together in time.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Too oaky, with vanilla, smoky toothpick influences leading to sweet-and-sour pineapple flavors. This problem has plagued Kunde's reserve Chard for the last several vintages.",US-California-Chardonnay

"The vineyard is in a very cool, damp part of the valley, and this particular bottling always shows a dry finish, considerable tannins and an earthiness not found in warmer parts of the appellation. This 2008 follows those lines. It has a dense core of sour cherry candy fruit, with some superripe currants. Will age interestingly over the decade.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Dry, dark-hued tannins cut through the wine, giving it a bitter feel. It is tough, firm, missing the balancing fruit.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Mer Soleil's Chardonnay grapes dependably get so ripe, they offer explosive flavors even without oak. You won't miss a thing without that barrel.

A mouthwateringly fresh squeeze of acidity makes everything bright and clean.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Currently dominated by tannins, this wine is rich and structured, and it demonstrates the potential of its huge fruit and weight. The final note of this age-worthy wine is smokiness from wood aging.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir

"Aromas of mealy apple and citrus are less than inviting, while the palate is citrusy but lacking in true Chardonnay character; instead it shows odd flavors of ham and orange juice. Ranks as yet another uninspired Argentine Chard in a long line of such wines.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"From vineyards on the north bank of the Douro, this is a rounded, smooth wine that has layers of black fruits and finely integrated tannins.

"Ultrarich and fruity, this Cabernet shows the grapey ripeness Paso Robles is famous for. The wine is fresh and jammy in blackberries, cherries and raspberries. It's a little one-dimensional, and the alcohol is very high, but not hot. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Stalky, roasted, horsey, baked-fruit aromas are mossy and muddled. Colomé always makes funky wines with true Salta character, but this one is soupy, thick and dense in feel, with herbal, savory, salty plum flavors. A dark, chunky, stewy finish concludes this unusual rendition of Malbec.",Argentina-Other-Malbec
This opulent Soave Classico is made from native Garganega grapes that see a bit of oak aging to acquire subtle tones of roasted almond and smoky mineral. Cool acidity caps the close and promises to match spicy chicken curry.,Italy-Veneto-Garganega

"Easy and fresh, with a simple, crisp finish, this should pair with garden greens or sliced tomato and mozzarella",Italy-Veneto-Pinot Grigio

"With a buoyant percentage of Sonoma Coast fruit added to that of Napa Valley, this is a minerality-driven wine, vibrant in the glass from start to finish, softly layered and generously expressive. Amid the suggestion of ocean salt, it offers a mix of lemon citrus and chiffon, teetering between bright and ripe.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Solid but unspectacular on the nose, with plum scents and generic sweetness. The palate is also sweet, but it has enough acidity and tannin to create a serious, almost scratchy mouthfeel. And if you hadn't had enough sweetness up to this point, the finish is loaded with brown sugar, cola and cough medicine.",Spain-Central Spain-Tempranillo
"This is a rich wine that has aromas of ripe white fruits and touches of apricot. Intensely fruity and refreshing with wonderful acidity, it is also finely balanced wine with a density of texture.

"This playful, drink-now blend of 64% Counoise and 36% Cinsault is great for those seeking to try lesser known Rhône varieties. Rose petals, plum blossoms, hibiscus and gamy notes entertain the nose.

"This Garnacha is heavily oaked.Smoky, woody aromas come with dusty berry notes, while the palate is heavy, with cheek-smacking tannins. Flavors of hickory and roasted blackberry finish with another creamy, woody dose of oak.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"Coming from a cool vintage and one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine is starting to show some age, with evolved notes of dried fruit, mineral, licorice and baking spice. The cranberry, cherry and spice flavors show depth and intensity. Drink now.",US-Washington-Syrah
"The aromas of powerful cedar, cherry, currant and oak suggest great concentration and focus. It’s actually a bit light on the fruit and soft in tannins, although the oak is plush and toasty. There’s certainly elegance and flavor, but it’s a wine to drink now, not age.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dr. Loosen offers a solid value in this remarkably well-priced eiswein. It's enticing on the nose, with aromas of honey, saffron and a dark, dusty mineral tone. Rich and silky in texture, it's concentrated and lively on the palate, with intense flavors of lemon and peach. Finishes with a tinge of tea and spicy orange rind. It's delicious now, but should develop well through 2020.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling

"Broad scents of honeydew, candied lemon and orchard fruit mark the nose, with an underpinning of toasted nut. The palate is medium bodied, with balanced acidity and apple flavor.",US-Virginia-Viognier
"The 2003 Cliff Edge Shiraz shows plenty of intensity: bright cranberry-raspberry fruit, bold notes of cured meat and overtones of cedary oak. Tannins are supple, the structural underpinnings reliant on crisp acids instead. Use that tartness to offset some of the richness of stews or roasts.",Australia-Victoria-Shiraz
"A spicy oak aroma, fresh red cherry and cranberry flavors and a brisk, slightly tannic texture make this wine quite appetizing. While medium bodied, it has plenty of flavor impact as well as an enticing mouthfeel.",US-California-Sangiovese

Balanced acidity and tannins ensure good drinking both now and deep into the future, with chaparral-laced flavors of ripe raspberry, boysenberry and even watermelon.",US-California-G-S-M

"A pure Cabernet, sleek and young, but already showing it has the stuff to age. Pretty cassis and black cherry fruit is framed in a smooth and compact structure with supporting acidity and judicious application of new (50%) and used French oak. Immediately appealing, but built for cellaring.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A fleshy wine with aromas of wet clay and earth. It seems a little hot and herbal at its foundation, but around the edges there are flavors of cherry and raspberry. The feel is chunky and innocuous, with mild tannins.",Argentina-Other-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This creamy and delicious blend of 80% Petite Sirah, 10% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre truly outperforms all its parts. It offers high tones of red fruit, earthy licorice and tamed tobacco. Medium in body with well-behaved tannins, it has a dusty finish that's very appealing.",US-California-Red Blend

"Cherry and orange please the palate immediately, with a subversive note of peat and forest—it's a good commingling of fruit and exotic savory elements that remain memorable through the lengthy complexity of medium-bodied, velvety texture and weight. This wine is so good now it'd be hard to set it down, but it will reward cellaring, through 2024.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Coffee tones along with floral and vanilla aromas pervade on the nose. The tart-cherry palate is supported by mouthwatering acidity and chewy, slightly dry tannins. Pair alongside a juicy steak.",US-Washington-Petit Verdot

"A touch of caramel lies over the crisp fruit, giving a round texture, smooth and rich. The red fruits are bright and have the fresh final acidity.",France-Provence-Rosé
Frothy fizz carries fresh lemon and lime scents to the surface. The palate has the same citric flavor profile and is diffuse with lots of bubbles—which exaggerates the lightness of the dry palate even more. While there is not a lot of substance there certainly is lots of refreshment.,France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"Fruit for Casal di Serra is selected from the estate's best vineyards, near the Adriatic city of Ancona in central Italy, and the wine undergoes some wood aging for a fuller, more structured feel.

"This is modeled on southern Rhône blends—a fairly straightforward mix of 85% Syrah and 15% Grenache. Grainy and smoky, with a slight charred aspect, this focused effort displays deep pomegranate fruit, soaked in soy, balsamic and other umami notes.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"After the sulfur smell blows off, this wine remains tough in acids and tannins.",US-California-Dolcetto

"Made from the same blend of grapes in Amarone, this dessert Recioto is a dark and thickly extracted wine that tastes much sweeter than it smells. In fact, the bouquet is redolent of hearty dry wine aromas such as black fruit and Indian spice. Residual sugar and refined tannins make for a powerful combination in the mouth.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"

"Pretty blossom and apricot aromas bolster ripe, rich flavors of honey tangerine and yellow peach in this forward, fruity wine.

"This elegant red blend—the new flagship wine from Bedell—starts with a soft, juicy nose with hints of cedar and cinnamon. On the palate, a burst of cherry, plum and blackberry flavors mingle with spice and smooth tannins. The finish has an appealing spin of exotic spices. Though ready to drink now, the wine will benefit from a few years in the cellar, allowing its elements to even further integrate.",US-New York-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Light toast, forest floor and espresso aromas partner with notes of leather and tilled earth. The palate is still closed but reveals dried cherry, raspberry, ground pepper and savory herb alongside a tannic backbone. It's young but balanced, with bright acidity and austere tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Clean and fresh, and also varietally correct as it unloads full but accurate aromas of cucumber, passion fruit and lime. Casas del Bosque does very well with Sauvignon Blanc. This wine has all the citrus, tang and style you could ask for, but it shows good depth and complexity as well, which is what pushes it up to the next level. For $14, this wine delivers plenty.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc

"This dark, potent, full-bodied wine is made from two of the darkest, most tannic grape varieties—Petit Verdot and Petite Syrah—and there is nothing petite about this blend.

"Produced by a négociant based in Nuits-Saint-Georges, this is a ripe, Burgundian take on Beaujolais.

Drink now.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay

"This Malbec blend is bright, jammy and grapy on the nose. The palate is juicy but bumpy and rough in feel, while fresh-fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry are a little too candied and simple for a wine of this level. A ripe medicinal finish is lush but awkward.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Funky aromas of game, leather, mature black fruit and a whiff of barnyard carry over to the rustic palate. Raspy, astringent tannins and prune sensations give it a bitter, mouth-puckering finish. Tried twice with consistent results.",Italy-Southern Italy-Primitivo
"The texture is smooth and velvety on this Zinfandel, but the flavors are off. You'll find ripe blackberry jam and currants right next to overripe raisins. Enormously high alcohol makes this wine taste like a fruity, simple port.",US-California-Zinfandel

Nose is fruity, with nectarine and mango highlights.",Australia-South Australia-Riesling
"This long-aged (42 months) vintage Cava opens with a whiff of exotic bath soap along with more familiar apple and pear scents.

"Shea is one of the Willamette Valley's most revered sites, and an all-star list of wineries compete for the fruit. Here the bright flavors of ripe raspberries are elevated with tangy acids, putting a tight frame of citrus around the core.

"This winery's Pinots rarely rise to the top, but are almost always soundly made, very good wines, with extra points for complexity. The '05 is directly on par with previous vintages, a silky, dry wine showing rich flavors of cherries, cola, pomegranates and spices. It's the kind of Pinot that pairs well with foods without taking center stage.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A 100% varietal wine from the winery property, certified organic to boot, this is classic in cedar, currant and a freshness of blackberry.

"The wine is perfumed, spicy with dense tannins. It has a hard-edged structure, tough with the ripe fruit still underneath. Vines are an average of 14 years old.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"There's no denying this wine's greenness: It's draped all over the nose, palate and finish. But that doesn't mean it's not a classy, structured, tangy wine with length and clarity.

"Richer, fruitier and heavier than Sangiovese really ought to be, but then, this is Alexander Valley, not Tuscany. It's a big wine, jammy in chocolate-covered cherries and licorice, and while the only thing Italian about it is the acidity, it's a tasty wine.",US-California-Sangiovese
"The lightest of Sea Smoke's trio of Pinots, the '05 Botella starts with ravishing aromas of red fruit confections like cherry pies and raspberry tarts, with notes of gingerbread and cinnamon sugar.

The rest is just a burnt, charred, overoaked mess with flavors of earthy berry, leather, peanut and resin. A poor effort that makes you wonder what the winery was thinking.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Floral, ripe and fragrant, this is a stand-out from a new entrant on the vintage Port scene. The forward blackberry flavor is full of sweet tannins. At the same time, the structure, with its core of dense dryness, does promise good aging. This is concentrated and full of potential.",Portugal-Port-Port
"There's an intense purity to this Sauvignon Blanc that makes it particularly refined and elegant. In fact, this is Stag's Leap's best in many years. It has a translucency that lets you taste the minerally soil from which it comes, alongside immaculate citrus fruit, gooseberry and dried herb flavors.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Fresh tangerine and orange blossom notes mingle with slightly yeasty, leesy aromas on this otherwise refreshing wine. It's dry in style with bright lime acidity and a lively finish.",US-New York-Riesling
"94–96. Barrel sample. A surprisingly fresh Margaux considering that it's dominated by 87% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dense tannins, black fruits and tight acidity combine to present a wine that shows, for a Château Margaux, medium-term potential.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This dark and attractive Shiraz shows excellent balance and a satiny texture. Notes of brambly raspberry and cherry mingle with seductive hints of sweet smoke, game and pepper. Hints of spicy mocha and forest berry linger on the finish. Approachable now, but should hold well and develop additional complexities through 2016.",Israel-Galilee-Shiraz
"Cinnamon, leather, roasted beef and red cherry show on the nose of this bottling from a winery that essentially enjoys its own appellation above the Cuesta Grade in the very southern corner of the Paso Robles region. Candied red apple and candied cherry show on the easy-drinking, somewhat sweet sip, with more cinnamon and a touch of bay leaf.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This wine delivers a solid hit for the popular Chardonnay style, with oak-inspired orange and mango flavors, in a creamy package. For the price, it's a good buy.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Solid on the opening, with red fruit aromas and a mild stalkiness. Feels healthy and medium in weight, with mild oak, fresh plum and berry, and a touch of cocoa for flavors. Dry and crisp on the finish, with leftover oak flavor and good balance.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Subtle and crisp in minerality, this Pinot Blanc has a rich texture and a taste of apple and pear with a savory, herbal element throughout. It would serve nicely as an alternative to Chardonnay, especially on the dinner table.",US-California-Pinot Blanc
"Very light in body, color and aromas. The nose is punchy and a bit sharp, and so is the palate, which offers crisp, bracing acids to highlight zesty, lean nectarine and tangerine flavors. Quite linear and citric, but experience with this wine says it shows best with food.",Spain-Northern Spain-Rosé
"A harmonious balanced wine, showing fine, fresh acidity. The tannins have closed in somewhat, but you can taste the chocolate, and the sweet character of the ripe fruit. At the end, the acidity gives a fine lift.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Spice and smoky oak aromas blend with perfumed berry scents and candy in front of an astringent palate with plum, cherry and smoky aftertones. Dark, minty flavors on the finish are matched by hard, rubbery tannins. Time in bottle could be a benefit.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A potpourri of violets, sweet baking spices and woodland berries take center stage. The savory palate offers up wild cherry, black raspberry and cinnamon alongside supple tannins and fresh acidity. Drink soon.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Smoky, cedary notes nicely complement the blueberry fruit in this McLaren Vale Shiraz. It's pretty full on the palate, with a slightly syrupy texture that extends the flavors through a mouthwatering finish. Drink now-2012.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"With good concentration as well as stalky tannins, this is a wine that has acidity and a touch of black jelly. Fresh at the end, well balanced.",France-Loire Valley-Cabernet Franc
"The nose gives appetizing glimpses of pure ripe juicy pear. These flavors blossom fully on the palate and leave a most harmonious picture of ample, dry, but well-expressed pear fruit with lovely freshness. Everything here happens with ease. The finish is pure and fresh.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"From a very fine vintage, this structured, tight while also fruity Champagne is poised and stylish. A creamy mousse balances the crisp texture and beautiful acidity. Red fruits and blood orange come through well at the end. It is ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Starts with scents of pear and melon, butter and spice, but takes on an ever-larger oak presence in the mouth, adding more and more wood spice and cedar. Not sure if this will ever completely integrate, so the best bet seems to be drinking earlier rather than later.",Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"Tantara's 2012 Pinots tend to be cloudy and light like this one, which delivers aromas of cranberry and allspice. It's very soft on the palate, with light chai flavors and the tartness of barely ripe pomegranate.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This frankly sweet sparkler smells like toasted almonds and pistachios, and tastes rich, round, floral and nutty. It has a good, fine bead, nice balance from the wine's acidity, and feels smooth and broad in texture.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"This Barolo is tightly wound, with aggressive tannins and nervous acidity. It lacks complexity and richness despite its core of black cherry fruit. It also shows evident alcoholic warmth and finishes on a green, astringent note.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"From three vineyards, including Roberts Road, this wine impresses in floral honeycomb and a freshness that belies its medium-bodied weight and pithy texture, finishing in vanilla that never gets sweet.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Forward and open, this has chocolaty, brambly raspberry fruit, along with pleasant hints of tobacco, vanilla and caramel. It glides through the palate smoothly, finishing with an elegant touch of stem, from 15% whole cluster fermentation.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This ripe, fruity wine has both freshness and a warmer, rounded character. Apricot and fresh white peach fruits are filled out with almond flavors as well as acidity. It's a wine to enjoy now, although it will be better from 2016",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"A 50–50 blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this is a fruity wine that also has a strongly tangy zesty character. It comes from vines on the Montagne de Reims, a rich source of great fruit that shows strongly in this Champagne. The bottling is still young and will benefit from another few months aging, so drink from 2018.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
Gritty minerally aromas of vitamins and medicinal plum and cranberry set up a full-bodied palate with creamy oak. Herbal spicy black-plum flavors finish oaky and a bit sticky and heavy.,Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir
"A powerful wine that is very ripe and soft. What makes it work so well is the toast, the acidity from a high proportion of Pinot Noir, and the dense, full structure. This is, without question, a food wine. It should also age over 4–5 years at least.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Barrel fermented and aged in 60% new French oak, this wine shows a pleasing mixture of fruit and barrel, intermingling aromas of toast, stone and tropical fruit, spice and butter. Flavors are light and elegant, but show a pleasing sense of balance.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"A beautiful, smooth, rich, intense wine, the structure clothed in great ripe layers of fruit. Touches of paprika balance with lively acidity and fresh berry flavors.",Austria-Burgenland-Austrian Red Blend
"Here's yet another wine bearing the signature of winemaker Ignacio Recabarren, and it's a touch thinner and disjointed than one might expect. The nose features blanched raspberry and a strong note of pine or fern frond. The mouth is chunky and plummy, and it evolves with air. But it is also a touch vegetal and never really hits stride.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromatic and fruity, this is front-loaded with pretty accents of toast and baking spices. There's 10% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, but it's Merlot's show, with forward, smooth, chocolaty goodness around a core of raspberry candy.",US-Washington-Merlot
"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is clean and almost delicate, with cranberry fruit, red licorice, dry leaves and drying tannins. It fades rather quickly, but would make a nice companion to a simple skirt steak.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Cherry, berry and smoke ride atop a sultry texture in this estate wine, 100% varietal. Leathery accents provide texture and additional weight as a buildup to a seamless, easygoing finish rides out.",US-California-Zinfandel
"From half an acre of vines within the Blanchot Grand Cru, this is a smooth, rounded wine. It has weight from intensely ripe fruits, along with structure. Beautifully sun-exposed vineyards add a warmth to the wine, but there's also a mineral texture, nervy acidity and tart apple-skin and green-plum flavors. While concentrated, it's still a young wine, so drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"A pink-tinged copper color and a pleasing blend of flavors make this sparkling wine from Schramsberg easy to enjoy. The aromas suggest cherries and cinnamon, the flavor is like tart raspberry and the texture is smooth with fine bubbles.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"This opens with aromas of prune, perfumed berry, baking spice, leather, a whiff of coconut and a balsamic note. The fresh palate offers wild cherry, crushed raspberry, lightly toasted oak, anise and espresso. It's still tightly tannic and astringent, but it should improve with a few more years in the bottle. Drink 2018–2028.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"While it's rich, this beautiful dry wine also offers considerable freshness. Acidity cuts easily through the ripe white fruit, pear and red apples, allowing room for spice that provides a contrasting aftertaste.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"Still closed, this only begins to show its fresh, rounded passion fruit and mango-cocktail flavors after it has had some air. The palate is concentrated and precise. This will come into its own by 2015.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"The nose is reluctant at first, but patience reveals struck match, smoke, slight mint and tar elements. The palate is dominated by tart red fruit, like cranberry skins, bolstered with pinches of brown spice.",US-California-Carignane
"With a bouquet packed with pure blackberry, boysenberry, chocolate, baking spice and minerally aromas, this immediately registers as excellent Malbec. The palate, like almost all Cobos heavyweight Malbecs, is smooth and layered. Flavors of meaty blackberry, exotic spices and chocolate yield to a polished, elegant finish that's earthy and delicious. Drink now through 2017; 275 cases produced.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A lightweight wine seemingly made for poolside sipping, with herbal-grassy tones accenting citrus notes. It's clean on the finish and as refreshing as a cool breeze.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"This fresh wine is all about fruit. Soft tannins and attractive strawberry flavors are lightly cut with acidity. Coming from vines between 50 and 60 years of age, it has some extra concentration. Drink this fragrant wine now.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This is a bright, frothy, light Vinho Verde that is very crisp and soft. A perfumed wine that demands to be drunk as a fresh, it has ample acidity and just a touch of sweetness. Screwcap.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White
"An off-dry blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Gros Manseng, this comes from the French southwest. Named after a sandy beach in the Basque Country, the wine has that cool feel of ocean breezes. Honey and lemon flavors are right up front to give a wine that is both fresh and beautifully fragrant.",France-France Other-White Blend
"This is made in a lighter, breezier style, but there's nothing light about the flavors, which suggest raspberries, grilled Canadian bacon, softened cola and smoky sandalwood. Gentle and easy, with a silky feel, this shows lots of class and elegance. Ready to drink.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Soft, simple and a little sweet, with candied pineapple, lemon and lime flavors touched with butterscotchy, vanilla oak.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Roasted, woodsy, rubbery aromas are gamy and staunch, with berry notes interspersed. Grabby, rubbery tannins make for a rugged palate, while roasted plum and gamy flavors are a touch salty. A tannic finish doesn't change much.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This wine is nervy, steely, taut and lean, offering earthy, savory aromas, tart cherry and raspberry flavors and a nicely puckering mouthfeel. More minerally than fruity, it provides an interesting example of an alternative wine style.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Attractive roasted, smoky aromas join ripe plum and blackberry flavors in this full-bodied, broadly textured wine. It's a great value and packs plenty of fruitiness into a rather big, moderately tannic frame.",US-California-Merlot
"This is a tannic, acidic, hard-to-appreciate wine due to the cold conditions of the 2011 vintage. But the wine, which is 100% Cabernet and was aged in 50% new French oak, still is a great success, testimony to skillful viticultural and winemaking practices. With a solid core of black currants, it wants until 2020 in the cellar.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dried oregano and sage notes lend a dusty, savory tone to the nose of this racy, light-bodied kabinett. The palate, by contrast, surprises with layers of lush, ripe tropical fruit cut with a razor's edge of acidity and lime zest. Finishes snappy and bright.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Sourced from the Seven Hills vineyard, this deep and dark Syrah offers rich black-cherry and cassis flavors. The palate is dense and complex, with beautifully integrated charcoal, gravel, earth and espresso components.",US-Washington-Syrah
"A blend of seven different varieties, this wine is aromatic and fruit forward, recalling blueberry pie and cocoa with a citrus top note. It's plush but still deft in feel with soft tannins and abundant blue-fruit flavors.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Adrianna sits at 5,000 feet, making it one of the highest vineyards in all of Mendoza. The wine shows pure Tupungato mountain fruit, with deep chocolaty undertones and lots of fine, toasty French oak. For deep berry flavors and smoothness more than rough and tough, Adrianna is on the money. Drink now through 2011.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"The aromas of clove, flowers, black olive and spice are bright, followed by penetrating notes of boysenberry and plum. The palate is supple and in feel, showing concentration but still elegance to the fruit flavors.",US-Washington-Malbec
"A lighter, more elegant style of Cabernet, dry and classy. Likeable for its balance of acids, tannins, alcohol and oak, and rich blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Angels is made from a majority of Merlot, the balance nearly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Black pepper, clove and a whiff of Dr Pepper give it a spiciness that's also fruity, while a softness of texture and medium body maintain approachability.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The wine is ripe and juicy with some smoky tannins in support. It has a finely perfumed character although the touches of extraction give it a bitter edge. That should blow by, leaving an attractive, fruity wine.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
The spicy nose already signals joy: Bosc pear is edged with mandarin and white-pepper spice. The concentrated palate flows with ripe juicy white-fleshed pear fruit but is given direction by gentle ripe citrus freshness and sheer bundling of flavor. There is welcome texture to the midpalate and beautifully penetrating zestiness. The finish is long and very moreish.,Austria-Wachau-Grüner Veltliner
"Bold aromas, thick layers of fruit flavor, and a supple but steely texture of fine tannins and acidity add up to a powerful and complex wine that should improve with age. Pure, dark-fruit flavors are accented by smoke and cardamom while the structure is mouthpuckering with astringency but softened by the richness of body and fruit. Best after 2019.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sweet/tart with a sugary core, this simple Riesling is a good, all-purpose bottle, but does not show much complexity. Lemon and lime sour candy flavors dominate.",US-Washington-Riesling
"A designation used only when a vintage deserves, this reserve is definitely worthy. Almost a decade after bottling, it offers an intensity of chocolate, cinnamon and clove against soft, mellowed and structured tannin. Dusty sage and a bramble of blackberry complete the picture. It may have another five to seven years of beauty left within, but why wait?",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This normally cool Premier Cru has done particularly well in the 2015 vintage. This bottling is ripe and full of white fruit, while keeping a strong line of fine, tight acidity. It will be ready to drink soon, so only wait until 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
The wine is full of bright fruit and acidity. It does still have a dry tannic core that gives it a firm character. The juicy acidity and crisp texture show it is still young. Drink from late 2017.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Crusty aromas of black fruits mesh nicely with lemon peel and floral scents. The acidity here is noticeably high, which creates a scouring mouthfeel. Short flavors of berry and cassis are shrill, while the body and cushion offered by this blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Viognier are modest at best.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Red Blend
"This wine is dry, packed with acidity at this young stage. It is crisp and lightly nutty in character, perfumed and still tangy with orange zest. Drink from 2016.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"Buoyant primary aromas of sunny peach and tangerine are juxtaposed against deep reverberating slate and flint in this gorgeously balanced Kabinett. It's lusciously textured but spine-tingling with acidity. The finish is long, lingering on warm spice tones. Drink now through 2020.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Made with 95% Sangiovese and 5% Merlot, this opens with delicate aromas of red currant and baking spice. The straightforward palate offers raspberry jam, clove and white pepper alongside rounded tannins. Enjoy soon.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"Another excellent Idus. The nose is jammed full of big berry, leather and earth aromas.

Drink now through 2015.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Made in an approachable style, light-bodied and yet showing an attractive level of richness, there's melon, oak and honey at this wine's core, accented by pretty floral notes of apple blossom and pie.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Rich, sweet chocolate flavors balance with equally sweet blackberries in this opulent wine. This ripeness goes right through to the heart of the concentrated texture, even the tannins sharing in the generosity. This is a delicious wine, but wait for five years and it will be even better.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Here's a no-fuss Sangiovese blend that exhibits measured tones of red fruit, spice, cola, balsam notes and dried flowers. It is full of delicate, elegant tones in the mouth and has a light touch on the palate: It's not too thick and has enough natural acidity to be refreshing and tight on the finish. Enjoy it with cream or butter-based dishes.",Italy-Central Italy-Sangiovese
"Sharp in acids and a little green, this dry red wine tastes like an old-fashioned Chianti. The flavors are of red cherries, herbs and pepper. Made from 70% Sangiovese and Cabernet Franc.",US-California-Red Blend
"Despite some heat and burn to the nose, there's nothing not to like about aromas of pecan pie and toffee. This Moscatel sweetie is solid in feel, but mostly around the edges; the middle palate is a bit weak. Flavors of brown sugar and caramel are more sweet and simple than complex.",Spain-Andalucia-Sherry
"Shows a weaker side of the 2006 vintage, with an overly broad mouthfeel and a certain lack of precision, but still boasts ripe apple and melon flavors.",Germany-Nahe-Riesling
"Light and easy to drink, with just enough apple and lime to keep things interesting. Makes a fine apéritif.",Italy-Veneto-Pinot Grigio
"Lightly peppery, herbal aromas and honeydew-melon flavors give personality to this soft, soothing and almost sweet wine.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc

The wood aging still shows in the spiciness, while the tight fruit flavors bring out the acidity. Drink this wine from 2016.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese Red
"Wines like this are why Yarra Valley has achieved a certain reputation for Chardonnay. It starts off with wonderfully complex aromas of spring flowers, honey, ripe peaches and citrus fruits, then crams honeyed hints of truffle and oranges into a full-bodied but dry expression of the grape.Finishes elegantly, with a dusting of dried spices.",Australia-Victoria-Chardonnay
"Smooth and soft, this easygoing wine has mild fruit and oak-spice flavors, low acidity and a touch of sweetness to round off any edges.",US-California-Merlot

"Red dusty berry cobbler marks the entry to this estate wine co-fermented with 2% Petite Sirah. Milk chocolate, nutmeg and clove play supporting roles in this otherwise bright, food-friendly wine with measured oak impact.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This is a bit Sancerre-ish in its light to medium body, aromas of struck flint and crisp flavors of grapefruit. Riper hints of fig and melon betray its New World origins, but it still finishes tart and racy.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Fresh cantaloupe aromas, mouth-filling pear and peach flavors and a generous texture make this an extroverted wine that could make a great pairing with salty cheeses. It is full bodied, very smooth-textured and long on the finish, where honey and vanilla flavors echo.",US-California-Viognier
"Made from 100% Chardonnay, this sparkling wine is absolutely delicious to drink now. It has vanilla, cream, lemon, lime and yeast flavors, accented with crisp acidity, and the bubbly mousse is soft and fine.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Too ripe, with red currant and raisin skin flavors giving it a bitterness despite some tasty chocolate and cherry jam richness. The alcohol feels high, leading to a hot finish.",US-California-Grenache
"A Cab-based wine with 20% Merlot, this has juicy blackberry and currant to soften the overreaching tannic profile. Blessed in cedar and tobacco, this also presents a strong showing of dried herb. The fruit leans black and blue, from blueberry to black plum, a nod to the Merlot.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Stemmy wet forest and a distinct note of mushroom opens this exotic wine, a full-bodied and concentrated expression of the coast. Tangy orange and juicy rhubarb flavors support the searing acidity that balances the wine and keeps it fresh and lively on the palate.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Already possessing the deep, old gold color of a mature dessert wine, this lush Viognier tastes fresh as a daisy. Its crisp acids frame sweet flavors of apricots, oranges, vanilla custard, white chocolate and honey. It's not an ager, though, so drink now.",US-California-Viognier

"Dark black and purple in hue, this wine has a dullness and dilution to the palate, which is dense in blueberry and leather, lacking grip on a quick finish.",US-California-Syrah
"With the same winemaking team as Bouchard Père et Fils in Burgundy, this wine is rich and generous. It has great red fruits and hints of the toast from the wood aging of part of the wine. It is a generous wine that will age well over the next year, so drink from late 2017.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This wine is ripe, full of yellow fruits that are balanced with crisp acidity. That gives a balanced wine that is juicy, perfumed and rich. The aftertaste is equally attractive, showing lemon-zest flavor.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"There's a chalky power to the nose of this lightly hued wine, its baking soda aromas melding with rose petal, lime peel and watermelon scents. There's tremendous tension to the palate, where bubblegum and ambrosia melon flavors meet limestone-like minerality. Ripe enough to make it playful, it's bright enough to drink all day.",US-California-Rosé
This light to medium-bodied wine follows initially earthy and metallic aromas with decent plum flavors. The aroma clears up with time and the wine's soft texture and fruitiness peek through.,US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"A full-bodied wine made from a cross of Traminer and Roter Veltliner, this is rich with pepper spice and yellow and white-fruit flavors. Very structured and youthful, the wine needs another year, maybe more to develop. Screwcap.",Austria-Thermenregion-Rotgipfler
"The 79% Syrah component is estate-grown; while the 21% Grenache comes from the Lonesome Springs vineyard. What a lovely nose, with the bright and grapey Grenache shining through and adding pretty floral scents, while the Syrah fills in the berries and peppery tannins. This is still quite purple and youthful, fresh and just a bit volatile.",US-Washington-Syrah
"An aromatic wine with notes of dried apricot and flowers. At 70 g/L residual sugar, it drinks sweet and is a quaffable crowd pleaser.",US-Washington-Riesling

"Bright and crisp, but with nice depth and length, too, this medium-bodied wine is delicious to drink and holds interest with a light touch of oak. Tangy grapefruit and lime flavors have a hint of brioche and the texture is very lively.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Hard to keep from falling in love with this wine. It's so luscious in bright, spicy wild cherry, raspberry and root beer flavors. With a satiny texture and brilliant acidity, it's stunningly drinkable now, but should hold and develop over the next six years.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Bright aromas of freshly roasted coffee beans, brown stems, dried herbs, purple flowers, mineral and black pepper are followed by ethereally light fruit and savory flavors that focus on elegance. This wine provides plenty of interest but the finish seems a bit clipped. It might lengthen out with aging.",US-Washington-Syrah

"Enticingly bracing grapefruit freshness streams from the glass. The palate has a milder sort of freshness—think very ripe bright lemon notes. The flavors are pleasingly focused—sharp and clean, with dryness and a soaring freshness that lightens up everything. There is a wonderfully light touch here. It's a beautiful and totally refreshing wine. Drink 2017–2030.",France-Alsace-Riesling

Concentrated in flavor, tight and dense in texture, it will need time to reach its peak, and will be best after 2020.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a ripe, spicy and full-bodied wine from the Robin group of producers created by Grand Moulin's Jean-Francois Renaud in Blaye. The wine has both structure and rich blackberry fruit. The tannins are dusty, spicy and with fine acidity to balance. Drink this fine wine from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The new project of Erica and Kim Crawford (yes, the Kim Crawford), Loveblock is situated on a spectacular windswept promontory overlooking the sea. Passion fruit, vibrant and pure, marks the nose, while the plump palate reveals hints of gooseberry that linger through the extended finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Kesseler's gems are the GG wines, but this is a medium-bodied, cleanly made introduction to the estate. Petrol, apple and wet stone notes are pretty standard Riesling fare, rendered in a crisp, refreshing style.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Made by Ric Forman from Zin grown on the Nichelini Vineyard in Chiles Valley and Sangiovese from the Antinori family's Antica Vineyard on Atlas Peak, this wine is rich and dense in red fruit that's layered and ripe. Aged for a year in used Burgundy barrels, it retains juicy freshness and elegance, with subtle touches of vanilla and baking spice.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Alvarinho with a prickle is unusual, as is a Vinho Verde that has been aged an extra year before release. The wine doesn't quite work because it has lost its fruit and developed a strong pepper and spice character. The acidity at the end is the most characteristic part of the wine.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Alvarinho
"Fresh and vibrant aromas of dark cherry and purple flowers get serious weight from a touch of tar on this very balanced, tighter Cabernet. Dark red fruits, sweet plums (and their more tart skins) and even blueberry show on the palate, which is equally acidic and tannic. It's neither lean nor lush, but right down the middle.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Intense floral aromas that initially recall air freshener then burn off to reveal more subdued sensations of blue flower on this blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon. The palate offers a core of black cherry accented with notes of cedar, white pepper and espresso alongside firm, drying tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"This bright and easygoing Rosso offers cheerful aromas of cherry, blueberry, white almond, smoke and spice. It has a very nice tannic structure, and good dimension and density as a result. Drink it with red or game meats.",Italy-Tuscany-Prugnolo Gentile
"The tropical-fruit aromas set the scene for this ripe apricot and peach-flavored wine. The palate shows rich fruitiness contrasted by a green, herbal edge. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"A light, fresh wine, showing berries, a touch of wood and very soft tannins. The finish shows a more meaty, rustic aftertaste, but also good acidity.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"This tiny-production wine shows an attention to detail in the vineyard and cellar. The clonal selection shines, given partial barrel-fermentation, partial stainless steel, all aged in mostly neutral French oak. Honeysuckle aromas jump from the glass, followed by viscous, juicy tropical elements of mango and lychee. It finishes dry and lemony.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This crisp, dry rosé is very fresh with delicious acidity. It has a bright character, lively and full of raspberry flavors. Drink now.",France-Southwest France-Rosé
"A milky aroma, creamy texture and nice butter, peach and vanilla flavors add up to a rich taste for this big, soft, mouthfilling wine.",US-California-Pinot Blanc
"Dried cherry and strawberry notes are marked by a hint of anise on the nose of this lush, velvety Pinot Noir. While delicate in frame, ripe berry and cherry flavors build in concentration on the palate, accentuated by a spray of pomegranate acidity and lingering bramble notes.",US-New York-Pinot Noir
"Dry, thin and simple, with a green, minty streak and lots of acidity. Still, with some decent blackberry fruit, it's not a bad wine for the price.",US-California-Red Blend
"The aromas on this Carignan-Syrah blend are gritty and suggest asphalt, smoked meat and dark berry notes. It feels electric and tight on the palate, yet controlled, with rubbery tannins and plenty of herb, pepper, spice and licorice notes to go with the oak-infused berry flavor.",Chile-Maule Valley-Red Blend
"A Barbera offering dark plum and handfuls of meaty brawn, it has rounded tannins and plenty of intensity. Pair this with spicy sausage and risotto to help it mellow.",US-California-Barbera
"Not just old vines, but ancient vines, this is a juicy, concentrated and ripe wine. It is sufficiently rich and textured to need some aging to bring out the full fruits even more. Drink from 2014.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"A whirlwind of aromas—peppered black cherries, elderberry, caramel, toast, barrel smoke—rise off this appellation blend from German-born winemaker Matthias Pippig, who handcrafts small batches on Santa Barbara's Eastside. It's very soft on the palate, with medium-dark flavors of butter-crusted plum pie and an herbal note of pine pitch keeping it serious.",US-California-Syrah
"The 17-acre vineyard is situated right at the western end of the Cahors appellation, giving a fresh feel to the ripe blackberry fruit flavors. There is an attractive, juicy feel to this wine. Soft, dusty tannins and bright acidity contribute to a wine that is now ready to drink.",France-Southwest France-Malbec-Merlot
"As its name suggests, this vineyard is above the Marconnets, one of Beaune's top vineyards. Beautifully perfumed, it is ripe with orange zest, apples and a streak of delicious citrus acidity. It has a light touch, fruity, with hints of wood and minerality.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Open and flattering, as are many of the 2000s, showing a dose of smoky, toasty oak layered over buttered nuts, honey and peach. Turns more citrusy on the finish, with tangerine and mineral notes lingering gently. Quite oaky, but has the depth of fruit to support it.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"From a tiny, organically farmed vineyard outside of Occidental, this wine is dense in earth, with a brambly nose of wild cherry and cranberry. Salty and herbal, it retains plenty of acidity on the light-bodied palate, offering a mix of cinnamon and tangerine on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Fresh and easy, this shows bright berry aromas, with subtle touches of forest floor and bramble. This should pair well with barbecued pork or grilled hamburgers.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"The aromas of crushed rock, smoke, ham hock, violets, red fruit and herbs are light but intriguing. The palate is elegant and restrained, coming in waves, with raspberries, smoked meat and mineral. It shows impeccable balance throughout and great length, winning on its subtleties rather than power.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Stewed prune aromas carry over to the palate, along with raw sour cherry, camphor and espresso notes. It's a tight and astringent wine with bracing tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Clean nectarine and red plum aromas open this quaffable Garnacha rosé. Lightly salty stone-fruit flavors are pushed by bright acidity, which is about all that remains on a racy but mostly tasteless finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Rosado
A Bordeaux saved from its high alcohol by its acidity. There is power and superripe fruit yet parallel to these is the black currant acidity that cuts right through. Age for 1–2 years.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This single-vineyard wine from Dogliani, the spiritual home of Dolcetto, is made with wild yeasts. It's fragrant and structured, concluding with restrained wild-cherry, spice and mineral notes that come together with flair and finesse.",Italy-Piedmont-Dolcetto
"This leads with aromas of white flower, toast and beeswax. The rather lean palate delivers yellow apple skin, citrus zest, a hint of roasted almond and a touch of vanilla alongside brisk acidity.",Italy-Lombardy-Turbiana
"Very dry and tannicly tart, with blackberry, currant and pepper flavors touched with oak. This is a good, everyday wine to drink with rich meat dishes and cheeses.",US-California-Syrah
"Pipe and chewing tobacco appear at first and are followed by mature tones of prune, plum and dark spice. This masculine and brawny expression has the acidity to pair with deep pan pizza piled high with toppings.",Italy-Central Italy-Sangiovese
"Olivier gets better each year, with the 2008 showing concentrated ripe tannins in a rounded structure of delicious black plum fruit. The tannins suggests that the wine could age well.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Golden in color, this has bready baked-apple aromas. It feels plump and soft for a brut nature, with a maderized quality to the palate. It tastes extremely dry, like seltzer water blended with citrus, almond and butterscotch. It continues on the same flavor plane throughout the finish.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"Aged in 30% new French oak, this has brown sugar, cola and root beer notes to back up its black cherry fruit. Coelho has shaken up its lineup, made some clear improvements and kept prices in line. Drink now or through the early 2020s.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Light and almost effervescent in the glass, this popular Grenache-based pink from Doug Margerum offers yeasty, Champagne-like aromas, soft lemon-peel scents and wet slate minerality. The palate's tingling acidity delivers chalky lime and cotton candy flavors, bound together with compelling tension.",US-California-Rosé
"A bold, inky-black style that is slightly overdone and a touch overripe. Despite aromas of blackberry preserves, prune and rum cake, this is a strongly masculine wine that puts its savory side first. The close is packed tight with smoked bacon and cured beef aromas. Textured tannins create some astringency on the finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Tasty but ultimately simple, with raspberry and cherry jam, orange rind and plenty of sweet, toasty oak flavors. Drink up.",US-California-Syrah
"An austere, savory Zin from Amador, one of the smaller-production Zinfandels from Renwood and it shows. Firm tannins, dusty black fruit and spice—a good option for Sierra Foothills Zin fans.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This opens with aromas of new oak, burned rubber, raisin and vanilla. The one-dimensional palate offers candied date, fig, mocha and licorice alongside bracing, grainy tannins that leave a mouth-puckering finish. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak spices and astringent tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"This may be the best bottling yet by actress Drew Barrymore and her team. The pale-pink wine offers light pink lemonade, plum, cherry and bubblegum aromas. The palate combines lime juice, pluot flesh and mandarin zest, set against a chalky backbone and laced with bright acidity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Very pale in color, this is a wine that has memories of fruitiness rather than the fruit itself. It is neutral, soft with acidity at the end and dull.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"86-88 Fine fruit, lovely black currant character, with fine acidity and great freshness. A delicious wine. There is some Carmenère in the blend.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Nice and dry, with a crisp cut of acidity that gets those tastebuds whistling. If you like gooseberries, it's for you, although there are far richer tropical fruit flavors in this lovely wine. The vineyard is in St. Helena.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"There's a touch of juicy sweetness here that recalls ripe blackberry or strawberry tart. You'll also recognize tones of spice, leather and tobacco that make for balanced background flavors.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Chocolate mocha and black fruit define this full-bodied, robustly made and oaked wine from a mountain appellation. Moderate acidity helps cut through the generous tannin and rich ripeness, finding a brushy dried sage note along the way.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Clean apple fruit with some yellow plum as well, this carries a whisper of citrus. It's a sleek elegant wine, that won't overpower you, nor obscure the flavors of more delicate foods such as prawns or whitefish.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"A boisterous, easy-drinking red wine that gushes ripe fruit and sweet oak aromas. It tastes almost sweet, like blackberry jam, and seems soft-textured in spite of its full body.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"From coastal hills near Jenner, this is true Sonoma Coast fruit, and it shows in its cool-climate embrace of red fruit and white pepper. Leather saddle marks the personality of the texture and soft acidity keeps it full-bodied and relatively dense.",US-California-Syrah
"Packed with red fruits, this is a bright wine. It has fine tannins due to aging half in French oak and half in stainless steel to give a balance to a wine that is crisp and fresh. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This opens with delicate floral and citrus aromas, while the palate offers lemon drop and juicy yellow-apple flavors alongside crisp acidity. Pair this with linguine topped with clam sauce. Terroir Society, Potomac Selections.",Italy-Central Italy-Pecorino
"Firm, tannic and fruity, with some nice tropical fruit flavors, wrapped around stiff tannins and some green, slightly stemmy flavors. The finish is hard and rough.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A darkly tannic wine, with licorice and espresso coffee flavors as well as intense blackberry fruits. It is firm, the wood aging showing through strongly at this stage. Keep for 3–4 years so that the alcohol burn can blow off.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Bortolin's Extra Dry Prosecco delivers sharp effervescence and soda-like tones of lemon, lime and white stone. In the mouth, however, the wine is creamy and soft thanks to its foamy bubbles.",Italy-Veneto-Prosecco
"Much of the fruit for this wine came from Alexander Valley and it represents the appellation well, combining the ability to be juicy and approachable with powerful tannins and the potential to age. Cassis, raspberry and black pepper are standout characteristics, and the wine is big, but balanced.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This vintage delivers a wine with deep and rustic cherry, boysenberry, sweet herb and rose aromas, the latter contributing a penetrating floral dimension. Pure raspberry, potpourri and thyme notes pop on the palate, where clean acidity and tight tannins provide a light frame and carry the flavors toward a caramelized finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"You want to give this wine 5–6 years in the cellar, at the very least, to let its components come together. At the moment, it's quite dry, acidic and oaky. Primary fruit flavors of raspberries and cherries should begin to develop bottle complexity by 2017.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This opens with enticing aromas of toasted hazelnut, Key lime and white peach. The firm, controlled palate is concentrated and long, offering vivid, precise fruit and a tasty hint of skin phenolics.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"This blend of Merlot and the two Cabernets is similar to Blackbird's far more expensive proprietary bottlings, but is nearly as good. It displays the house style of accessible fruit, in the way of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa, wrapped into refined but firm tannins. Drink it now with Cabernet-friendly food, especially a great char-broiled steak.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"There's a toughness to this wine that makes it a little hard to appreciate. The tannins are raw, and there's a green, herbal quality to the cherry and raspberry fruit. The oak seems to stand aside, and so does the acidity. It's all a bit ungainly now and is unlikely to improve with age, so drink up.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Ripe grapy aromas are more chunky than mammoth. Saturated and muscular on the palate, this tastes of roasted salty blackberry, while the finish is full and meaty in both flavor and texture. Drink this stout full-bodied Malbec through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Steady and focused, this has tight aromas of blackberry and spice that open and evolve the longer the wine stays in the glass. There's a touch of sweet strawberry on the finish.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"A blend of Pinot Blanc and four other white grapes, this pleasant and fruity wine offers simple enjoyment. Peach, pink-grapefruit, straw and cracker flavors show on the palate and lead to a dry finish.",US-Oregon-White Blend
"Il Concerto Brut is a tonic and tight Italian sparkler with dry aromas of lime, talc powder and crushed white pepper. The wine is fine, smooth and shows a touch of spice on the finish.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"This powerful blend of Petite Sirah, Petit Verdot, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc is smoky with oak and thickly concentrated on the palate, with sweet blueberry fruit and dark chocolate flavors. Round and rich, it has moderate acidity.",US-California-Red Blend
"Made of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo, this offers black tea and mature plum aromas, while the palate evokes dried cherry, clove and star anise flavors. Firm, close-grained tannins generate an austere finish. Give it another few years to soften, then enjoy.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Aromas of sun-dried tomatoes, coffee, cinnamon, toast, blackberries and currants introduce a wine that drinks light and fruity. Some pretty flavors here, with lots of spice and soft tannins. Nothing to write home about, but nice enough for a dry red table wine.",US-California-Merlot
"This wine from Moris Farms is ripe with thick layers of blackberry, forest fruit, green leaf, dried hay and earthy Porcini mushroom. It has a chewy, almost sweet consistency with bold texture and good length.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Light in structure and made for early drinking, this Pinot is crisp and dry, with cherry, cola and minty flavors. High acidity gives it a searing taste that calls for rich fare, like ahi tuna tartare.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A true GSM in its comingling of 67% Grenache with 24% Syrah and 9% Mourvèdre, this wine is burly in red and black cherry, while retaining a softness of texture and powerfully generous body weight. Cinnamon and earth round out the finish.",US-California-G-S-M
"Concentrated, dark and distinct, the bouquet expresses notes of cumin and flower. It's round, grabby and a bit gummy feeling, with oaky, dark flavors of blackberry, resin and spices. The finish tastes mildly woody, with espresso accents.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Butterscotch and candle wax aromas signal a wine in the early stages of decline. In addition, this shows dusty apple and mild citrus scents. The palate is being kept upright by citrusy acidity, while flavors of nectarine and citrus end with bready, aged notes. Drink immediately or wait for the 2012.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"This is an intensely herbal wine. Its high alcohol doesn't take away from its green fruit, gooseberry and cool taste. Perhaps it does increase the intensity of all these elements, producing a wine that is both rich and also taut and mineral. It does seem to need more aging, so drink from 2018.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"A celebratory, medium-bodied comingling of stone fruit and green apple, this wine delights in its nicely integrated notions of structure and weight. It is ultimately succulent and satisfying.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"A tight, stalky wine, showing black currant and dark plum fruits, intense acidity and a dry, tannic character. It feels light, without great density, very up front and fruity.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A blend of Sangiovese, 15% Canaiolo and 5% Mammolo, this has earthy aromas of truffle, tilled soil, iris and ripe dark-skinned fruit. The chewy palate doles out juicy black cherry, ripe blackberry, black pepper, clove and a hint of mocha alongside solid tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Soft tones of toasted almond, cinnamon, nutmeg and espresso make for a bold and powerful bouquet. There's ample fruit, presented as dried blackberry and cassis, that gives the wine the heft it needs to support the tight tannic structure and acidity. Sour cherry flavors drive the lively finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
This blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Arinto is bright and herbaceous. There is also a more tropical character with pineapple and mango adding their riper notes. The end has a mineral edge. The wine will improve by holding until 2015 in bottle.,Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese White
"This wine is perfumed with notes of potpourri, red fruit, funk, crushed gravel, ash, olive, orange peel and peat. The palate explodes with fruit and savory flavors that bring a sense of depth but also a sense of elegance and weightlessness. A hyper-extended savory finish kicks it up a notch.",US-Washington-Grenache
"Woodsmoke, bramble and sharp raspberry sorbet aromas show on the nose of this appellation blend from winemaker Kevin Law and actress Challen Cates. Sour cranberry and tart plum skin flavors show on the palate, along with darker nutmeg-like spices.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A perfumed, finely structured wine, with firm, dusty tannins. The wood is well-balanced with acidity and some generous weight, finishing with black fruits and intense freshness.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This Paulliac-style blend of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot presents bright red fruit on the nose alongside black licorice and traditional cigar box scents. The flavors are dominated by red cherries with a touch of anise, sprig of thyme and pleasingly brisk finish.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"An eccentric Chardonnay, with botrytis-like flavors of apricot jam and honey dominating, but there also are rich notes of buttered toast and tropical fruit. It's dry and creamy and a little warm. Drink over the next 3 years.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Tannins and structure bring out the character of the 2010 vintage in this open, generally soft wine. It is already attractive, drinkable and fresh. Black currants dominate the natural fruitiness. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This majority-Cabernet Sauvignon is not aided much by the additions of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, the trio combining for an untidy mix of black olive and dust. The wine throughout is a bit flat and the finish quite abbreviated.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Forward on the nose, with standard apple and white peach aromas. The palate is a bit clipped and short, with green-leaning flavors of scallion matched with grapefruit. Finishes citrusy.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Forest, cola and grilled mushroom flavors punctuate the experience of this light-bodied wine that's subdued in structure and soft on the palate. Blueberry and white pepper notes close out the finish.",US-California-Syrah
"Piccini offers good value deals from Tuscany and this Riserva Chianti Classico follows in that tradition. The wine is compact and clean, in typical Sangiovese fashion, and ends with a bright blast of mouth-freshening acidity.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A rich blend that includes the local Abouriou grape gives a structured, firm wine that has both tannins and juicy black fruits. The oak aging still shows in the spice and vanilla edge that underlies the fruitiness. It should be aged, so drink from 2016.",France-Southwest France-Red Blend
"Buttered toast, vanilla cream, honey and jammy pineapple, lime and mango flavors give this Chardonnay incredible richness. Monterey acidity balances the palate briskly. Not particularly subtle, but a big, enjoyable wine.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is a ripe, fragrant, floral wine. A smooth texture is lifted by apple and peach flavors. Rich and full in the mouth, this creamy wine is ready to drink.",France-Beaujolais-Chardonnay
"This wine offers perfumed aromas of clove, blue fruit, orange peel, toast and wild flowers. The flavors show restraint, with fruit and barrel flavors lingering on the finish.",US-Washington-Syrah
"A big rich wine from a warm year. Its powerful, dense structure is dominated by wood aging and fine blackberry and plum fruits. There is concentration along with swathes of delicious fruit. Age it for 4–5 years.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"This is a crisp, fresh wine. It has attractive red fruits that are cut by juicy lemons. The touch of caramel in this blend of Syrah and Touriga Nacional is lit by the acidity and spiced by a final touch of pepper.",Portugal-Tejo-Rosé
"This salmon-colored rosé opens with aromas of chewing gum and something candied but nonspecific. A juicy palate suggests citrus, while the flavor profile is tangy but generic in this simple wine that blends fresh and sweet qualities.",Spain-Northern Spain-Rosado
"A rustic, brawny wine made for barbecued steak, this Cab has pronounced tannins balanced by lots of sweet, ripe fruit. The cherry, blackberry, plum and unsweetened chocolate flavors have a spicy, peppery finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The producer continues to impress with this estate Russian River white, an impressive ambassador for the region in its exuberant layers of apricot, honey and vanilla. The substantial texture and concentration stand out and add complexity. A lift of lemon meringue and spice complete the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This bottling is showing a touch of age on the nose, with clove, allspice and black-plum aromas most prominent. Dried ginger spices up the dried fig and plum on the sip, which approaches prune as well. Drink up now before more age sets in.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Sweet scents of powdered sugar and guava juice waft ebulliently from this full-bodied Pinot Gris. The palate is soft with luscious, ripe pommelo and white peach flavors but balanced by a dry finish with a refreshingly astringent note.",US-New York-Pinot Gris
"Way too tannic to earn a higher score, although the dryness is welcome, and the blackberry and black cherry flavors are complex, augmented with floral, licorice notes. The tannins hit the mouth hard, and are unlikely to age out.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Fermented to a plus-size 15.4% alcohol, this rare wine from one of Washington's oldest and best Cabernet vineyards shows what a gifted winemaker can do with great fruit. The play of flavors, mixing red and purple fruits, toasted nuts, mocha, caramel, bark and earth, is exceptional. The detail is extraordinary for a wine with such high alcohol. The acids and tannins are seamless and fine, and the flavors extend into an unusual finish that suggests menthol and eucalyptus – not generally a character found in Champoux fruit. All in all it's a wonderful voyage, and one of a handful of essential Washington wines.",US-Oregon-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Spicy new wood flavors dominate this otherwise strongly fruity wine. The tension between the two promises a rich, full and ripe wine for the future. There is enough weight, acidity, blackberry fruit and richness to balance out the wood aging. Give this dense wine until 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Mediterranean herb, black-skinned berry and baking spice aromas float out of the glass. On the firm palate, notes of anise and ground pepper accent a core of dried black cherries while aggressive, close-grained tannins grip the finish. Give the tannins a few more years to soften then drink up.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"This is a neutral, papery white wine, with a flat, rather than lively mouthfeel. The apple flavored fruit is there, along with a touch of licorice, but the freshness seems to have been lost along the way.",US-Oregon-Pinot Gris
"Black-cherry-cola aromas along with lots of licorice and Dr Pepper spice show on the nose of this bottling from a relatively new winery in northeast Paso Robles. There is slight sweetness to the palate, with baked cherry and baking-spice flavors. Accents of dried blackberry, leather, dried meat and purple flower add complexity.",US-California-Syrah
"This broad, fruity wine brings out ripe berry flavors in spades. It has generous fruit, soft tannins and a smooth, open texture. Drink now.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Aromas recall ripe black fruit and a whiff of game. The round palate offers ripe cherry, graphite, crushed blackberry and touch of white pepper alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2016.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"There's a ripe, waxy quality to this wine that recalls apricot and honey. The fruit flavors are ripe and soft, with a smooth feel to the palate that is enhanced by the wine's natural acidity and its bright effervescence.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"This is powerfully impressive, with its firm structure giving great depth to the rich black-cherry and plum fruits. Dense and tannic, it needs to age for at least four years.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Citrus peel, naked rock and cold mountain streams are the images conjured up by the first whiff of this fine, featherlight Riesling. Sprightly and fresh, wired and zesty, it is a reminder of the bracingly fresh and thrilling 2014 vintage. This will provide supreme refreshment on a hot day but also keep its cool in years ahead. Riesling ahoy!",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"McKinley Springs vineyard sourced this outstanding blend of Cabernet Franc (45%), Cabernet Sauvignon (36%) and Merlot (19%). A complex and inviting, dusty bouquet of herb, olive and tart fruits introduces a wine with smooth moves and subtle details. A perfect mix of Washington fruit with a Bordeaux grip.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Released at just a little over a year old, this demonstrates the promise of Lake County for Cabernet. It's a dry, polished and enjoyable wine, with a fine tannin-acid structure and good flavors of blackberries, currants, black cherries and smoky oak.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Baked pear and sweet, baked apple make for an inviting opening. The same friendly duet plays on the off-dry palate all the way to the lingering finish. Along the way, there are highlights of zesty lemon and richer hints of honey and melon. It's simple, fun and even a little bit intriguing.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"A Grenache-based Rhône blend, C'est Si Bon is good and very subtle. Like a Beaujolais, an earthy leather note emerges in between soft violet and raspberry tones. With a line of acidity, it's a fine wine for food.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Aromas of woodland berry, baking spice, orange zest, crushed rose and a whiff of balsam come together in the glass. It's savory and elegant, with tightly wound, fine-grained tannins that support ripe wild cherry, raspberry, cinnamon, mineral and menthol.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"Sweet pea blossoms, stone fruits and red raspberries perfume this lovely dry rosé made predominantly from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Sparkling acidity and an astringent tea-leaf note add structure to the ripe, supple red-fruit and berry flavors.",US-New York-Rosé
"Warm, earthy aromas of molasses, moss and baked fruit scream rich and big, and the palate matches that early announcement with cola, baked blackberry, coffee and syrupy flavors. Weighty and forceful, but not without style and a flash of elegance. Pure Toro; drink now through 2012.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tinta de Toro
"Delicate aromas of red apple and dried grass tease on the nose of this soft wine, while slightly more assertive flavors of lime and white melon rind unfold on the medium-weight mouth. Ample acidity keeps the finish fresh, but short.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Chardonnay
"While this wine is big on acidity, it does offer ripe, fresh blackberries and currants along with a firmer tannic background. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Crisp and very fruity, this offers bright and intense acidity. There is a light, tangy texture and a bright, poised aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"The opulence of this sparkling wine has to be tasted to be believed. It's far softer and silkier than the winery's companion new release, the 2005 J. Schram, but then the blend is the complete opposite. This one's mainly Pinot Noir, with the balance from Chardonnay. The Pinot Noir brings a warm, raspberry- and cherry-sauce richness to Chardonnay's limes and pears, while an extraordinarily delicious toastiness pervades the whole, as if it had been gently smoked. So enticing now, it's hard to keep from drinking the whole bottle, and you certainly can, but this is a wine that will age for 10–15 years.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"The aromas of ripe peach, jasmine, honeysuckle and mineral pop. It drinks just off dry, with a spritz of stone-fruit and citrus flavors that extend on the finish.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Ripe aromas of black cherry and blackberry come with hints of leafy herbs and a shot of alcohol. This four-grape blend is well structured but a touch tannic. Flavors of baked black fruits, herbs and olives finish savory, with plenty of unabsorbed oak.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Red Blend
"Rich and juicy, this wine holds excellent potential. With its ripe red-berry fruit, balanced tannins and acidity, and spice from the wood aging, it will become a concentrated wine. Drink from 2020.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This bigraisiny-smelling Malbec opens with overt oak aromas and related hints of char and lemon peel. An expansive palate is high in acidity and drying. Raw oak flavors rest atop baked plum, blackberry and prune notes, while this tastes toasty and charred on a powerful finish that's driven by tartaric acidity.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Notes of apple, spice and brioche lead to tart citrus flavors. A lively mousse keeps the attention high.",US-Washington-Sparkling Blend
"A standard Cabernet, dry and tannic. The best thing is the deep core of blackberry, currant, mineral and spice flavors. Drink now–2014.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is an impressive wine at the price and production level, a great go-to for multiple occasions. It delivers earthy, candied strawberry around a light, bright core, remaining soft and smooth in texture and intensity, finishing with a tease of milk chocolate.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Chalky oyster shell and saline notes accentuate the brisk, brash feel of this light-footed Chardonnay. On the palate, fresh apple and lemon flavors are accented by whispers of vanilla and spice. The finish is cutting and crisp.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Good value in an everyday Merlot. Smooth and plush in texture, the ripe flavors include cherries, blackberries, mocha, dried herbs and peppery spices, with a touch of toasty oak.",US-California-Merlot
"Oak tones of spice, smoke and toasted wood show prominently on this Chardonnay, juxtaposed against muted apple and pear flavors. Glimpses of pretty white floral and citrus lend freshness to the palate, amplified by zesty acidity and a sexy tinge of vanilla on the finish. Of the two bottles received for sampling, there was noticeable bottle variation with one showing signs of premature maturation. Drink now through 2019.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Bold and black with impenetrable thickness and inky tones of blackberry, smoked ham and peppercorn, this is a dense and opulent wine that shows the best of sunny Sicily with spicy overtones and a thick, full feel.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Syrah
"Dry, yes, but this wine is also soft and ripe. It has an attractive toasty character giving power to the midpalate. It's in the finish that the real acidity and dryness show most.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This is a generous wine, full of red-berry fruitiness and acidity with firm tannins. It is almost ready to drink. Wait until 2017.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Fresh and lightly fruity, it's crisp and fragrant. With great acidity and a touch of herbaceousness, it's ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine offers a somewhat untoward combination of herbs, nori, tire rubber and blue fruit. Flavors are sharp-edged backed by chalky tannins.",US-Washington-Merlot
"An attractively aromatic wine, full of open fruitiness. It has layers of black currant fruit that go with the fresh acidity, plus a touch of herbs that are followed by firm tannins. Juicy and ready to drink from 2015.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Here's a blend of Montepulciano (75%) and Aglianico (25%) with big, ripe intensity and polished tannins. Aromas include sweet cherry, blueberry and spicy cinnamon or vanilla. It feels big and bold in the mouth and would make a statement with lamb or beef.",Italy-Southern Italy-Red Blend
"Billy Wathen and Dick Dore pick this cofermented blend of 85% Syrah and 15% Viognier together on the same day. The result is very savory, with resinous herbs and root beer on the nose. Once sipped, a rainbow of dark flavors emerges: chopped Italian herbs, creosote, black olive, fennel, soy and orange pith, reminiscent of a North African tagine.",US-California-Syrah
"This purple Carignan smells jammy, with an infusion of raw oak. In the mouth, high acidity creates ample energy to balance the full body and structured tannins. Flavors of ripe blackberry and plum linger on the robust finish. Drink through 2022.",Chile-Maule Valley-Carignan
"Electric purple in color, this powerful wine opens with jammy, loud aromas of boysenberry and herbal qualities. Likewise, spunky berry flavors are herbal in nature. Minty oak and medicinal notes dominate a rubbery, long finish.",Chile-Cachapoal Valley-Carmenère
"Sometimes in a challenging vintage such as 2009, it is the least expensive, blended wines that benefit most, perhaps because grapes normally destined for the single-vineyard wines are redirected. Here, rich fruit flavors highlighted with streaks of caramel and toffee get things rolling quickly. Berries and cherries, firm acids, pretty spice and a lingering butterscotch finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Floral aromas reminiscent of citrus blossom, tuberose and black locust flower lift out of the glass. The bright, straightforward palate offers Bosc pear, lemon drop and toasted hazelnut alongside soft but fresh enough acidity.",Italy-Piedmont-Arneis
"From a warm-climate zone in a cool vintage, this wine is fascinatingly savory. Black and white pepper, game meat, crushed graphite and espresso aromas promise an awesome sip. It delivers with black peppercorn, green olive, black plum skin and elderberry flavors.",US-California-Syrah
"This wine's bold cassis fruit is accented by charred capsicum and vaguely herbal notes, giving it ample complexity at this young age. It's full bodied, yet creamy and supple in texture, with soft tannins on the long, mouthwatering finish.",New Zealand-Hawke's Bay-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This 100% varietal wine is robust in tannins and dry, leathery oak, but balanced enough to gradually reveal lovely hits of savory and spicy clove, tobacco and graphite. The fruit leans black and jammy.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Too much acidity on this Syrah and Mourvedre blend feels like a knife through the palate. But the cherry, cola and spice flavors are good, and the wine is fully dry and moderate in alcohol.",US-California-Red Blend
"While the aroma is a touch earthy, the flavors in this full-bodied and plush-textured wine resemble honey, peach and almond. With a hint of sweetness to round out the mouthfeel, this could be a good match for a wide variety of cheeses.",US-California-White Blend
"Nice fruit and some juicy bounce are the hallmarks of this pleasant, stylish Pinot Noir. The nose has bright plum and raspberry, but the aromas and flavors are controlled and wholesome, not funky or stretched thin. With a pinch of oak, this wine more than makes the grade.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Pinot Noir
"Grippy in sizably powerful mountain tannins, this wine is at first difficult to penetrate and will benefit from further cellaring, through 2022. In the shadows lurk full-bodied hits of floral violet and earthy cedar, with a tease of beautifully bittersweet chocolate.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The relatively low residual sugar in this wine gives it a leaner feel than Mosbacher's other 2007s, but the fruit comes through as lime, grapefruit and passion fruit, marked by Forst's prominent minerality. Very crisp and long; would pair well with many seafood dishes.",Germany-Pfalz-Riesling
"A liquid lullaby more than a wine, this Brunello caresses and smoothes over your senses with amazing intensity and harmonious aromas of cherry-chocolate fudge, almond paste, ginger, balsamic notes, blueberry pie, firewood and vanilla. There's a shroud of cedar and cherry fruit within the wine's unwavering structure and a seemingly endless finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Red fruits drive this tangy, fruity wine that is given shape by a more mineral texture. With dusty raspberry and plum flavors, it is shot through at the end with citrus.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This is tremendous in blackberries, currants and plums, with grilled meat and black pepper notes, and the tannins are rich and profound. Right out of the screwtop, however, there's a tinny, metallic taste that detracts. Your best bet is to decant this fresh young wine and hope it blows off.",US-California-Syrah
"Ripe black plum and cherry aromas are accented with hints of fresh herbs on this bold, full-bodied red. The palate is deeply concentrated with black fruit flavor, but touches of granite and wet stone lend a mineral elegance. Finishes moderately long with a velvety swathe of tannins.",US-New York-Red Blend
"Ripe fruit and oak mark this Cabernet Franc-dominated blend. That's both to its credit as well as a drawback. The wine is massive in cherry jam, currant and caramelized oak flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. But it's somewhat one-dimensional. Drink now–2016.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Appealing aromas of mature orchard fruit and chopped herb lead the way. The ripe round palate doles out creamy pear, white peach, candied ginger and a hint of bitter almond while just enough fresh acidity gives it a lift.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"Whispers of fresh green herbs lend elegance and restraint to this impeccably balanced Bordeaux-style red. Juicy, lip smacking red fruit shines on the midpalate, anchored against zesty acidity and nuances of earth, game and woodsy spices. Delicate in tannins, it's approachable already but should drink well through 2025.",US-New York-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Bold notions of strawberry and cherry form around a robust core of oak and tannin, giving this rounded, approachable wine a medium to full-figured build. Minty earth follows, an element of herb that's refreshing on the palate and impactful, a sign of its cooler-climate vineyard site.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Very toasty aromas mark this wine. While the toast is present on the palate, it also offers plenty of fruit flavors, conveying apricot and white peach along with a citrus edge that brings out the freshness. Drink this wine from 2022.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This medium-bodied red includes 8% Merlot, 3% Petit Verdot and 3% Malbec. Toasted oak scents lead the nose, followed by generous cherry, cranberry and cassis notes on the palate, supported by soft acidity.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Laced with really crisp fruits and red-currant flavors, this is a brightly fruity wine. Lively and with a tight texture, this is ready to drink.",France-Provence-Rosé
"One of the best Edna Valley Pinot Noirs ever. This region normally produces Pinots with crisp acidity and fine varietal character, and so it is here, with its cherry, black raspberry, red currant and sandalwood flavors. But there's extra depth and complexity, with a wildly exotic, spicy edge, that lift the wine into greatness. Right up there with the best of coastal California. Hard to tell where it's going, but give it a good decant before serving.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Leather, smashed berries and juniper reveal the age of this wine, further enhanced with a meaty mouthfeel, redolent with flavors of blueberry and purple fruits. Charred vanilla touches on the finish.",US-California-Tempranillo
"This is raisiny and soupy on the nose. A jammy, soft palate follows suit, while the flavors are pure prune and raisin. Stewy on the finish, this is overripe but still good. Drink soon.",Chile-Rapel Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Nothing on the bottle says this is oaked, but this Albariño smells like burnt plywood and sawdust. It's chunky and fat on the palate, with woody melony flavors that finish salty and dried out.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"An opulently ripe, wood-aged wine that's both fruity and textured. It has weight, richness, a lightly mineral texture with crisp apple and green plum flavors. Give this attractive while serious wine until the end of 2014.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese White
Villa Novara presents easy aromas of fresh forest berry and almond paste. The wine is informal and sharp making it an ideal companion to pizza with mozzarella or pasta stuffed with ricotta cheese.,"Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"A nice starter Pinot for the price. Will introduce newcomers to the variety's light, silky texture and savory berry and spice flavors, touched with smoky oak.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine, a regional blend, shows remarkable achievement in winemaking. Wild strawberry and red cherry exude on the entry, alongside floral elements of violet and lilac. Velvety, resolved tannins make it enjoyable from the get-go, layered in acidity for a buoyant lift on the midpalate and finish, which suggests cinnamon and tea. Enjoy now and through 2020.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Fairly deep in color for a sparkling rosé, Sparr's Brut Rosé offers bold, berry-like aromas with hints of spring flowers and a plump, slightly corpulent feel in the mouth. The flavors are a bit rustic, with hints of underbrush and scorched earth.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"Passion fruit, pickle brine and other marine-influenced aromas work the nose on this cool-climate, value-priced SB. The palate is both sweet and sour, with tangy lemon as the lead flavor and softer citrus coming on later. Basic in composition; easy to drink.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Light in color and texture, this is an interesting, grippy Pinot Meunier. The variety is a rare find in California where, as in France's Champagne, it is used as a blender in sparkling wine. On its own it is interesting, peppery and fruity.",US-California-Pinot Meunier
"Appealing aromas of grass, herbs and tropical fruit lead to tart, sleekly styled fruit flavors that show a touch of bitterness on the finish.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of coffee, fig, dried fruit and soy sauce are concentrated on the nose. Earthy flavors on the palate are elevated by these aromas, with a hint of Rooibos tea that gives it lift and intrigue. The tannins are silky and the finish is long with evolving flavors.",US-Virginia-Red Blend
"Licorice, cardamom, blueberry and cassis aromas are subtle but complementary. A firm, healthy feel isn't particularly hard or tannic, while candied berry and sweet oak flavors lead to a long, smooth finish. This blend of 67% Malbec and 33% Cab Sauvignon is ripe, ready and exemplifies Mendoza's penchant for big wines with balance. Only 150 cases made.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is 62% Cabernet Sauvignon and 38% Cabernet Franc. Barrel aromas are at the fore, with baking spice, woodspice and clove in front of dark fruit and herb. The palate brings sweet, sappy fruit flavors, with plentiful licorice and game accents.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Lovely honeysuckle and apple blossoms lead into lush flavors of gooseberry jam, lemon curd and apple butter; the mind reels at the complexity. It's all in perfect balance, the fruit set against bracing acidity, the hint of sweetness rounding out the mouthfeel, and the whole flavor circus rolling merrily along through an extended finish.",US-Oregon-Riesling
"Muted scents of orchard fruit and a touch of almond lead the nose. The vibrant palate offers pear, citrus zest and mineral accompanied by bracing acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"White rose, tangerine skin and honey open the bouquet of this beautiful cool-climate Pinot Bianco. Its structure is firm and creamy enough to pair with Pacific seafood or grilled shrimp.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Bianco
"This wine comes from an 8.6-acre parcel of old vines above Jolivet's home village of Bué. It is mineral and tight, with concentration and intensity. The herbal character on this very young wine will soften into the fine fruitiness that is there. It needs to age a bit more, so drink from 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"The ripe fruit of this vintage is right up front in this strawberry and spice-flavored wine. With a texture that adds a touch of tannin to the fruitiness, it is smooth and round. Drink this aromatic wine from 2018.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This offers subdued whiffs of blue flower, red berry and a hint of moist soil. On the rustic, rather diluted palate, bracing acidity and raspy, fleeting tannins accompany suggestions of tart sour cherry and orange peel. It finishes on an astringent note.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This Cabernet blend includes about 20% Syrah in the mix, which perhaps contributes to a lack of varietal character. It seems to be in a dumb phase, with no specific aromas and nondescript fruit. The finish turns acidic and chalky.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"With very ripe fruit and firm tannins, this mountain Cab shows attractive flavors of cassis and cedar. It's pretty tough and astringent in youth, so decant it and drink with rich marbled beef.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This opens with subtle aromas suggesting wild flower and orchard fruit. Round and ripe, the palate shows tropical fruit, pineapple and citrus peel alongside a saline note.",Italy-Veneto-Garganega
"There's a palate-warming generosity to this single-vineyard Pinot, a result of its softly balanced texture and the smoothness of new oak. Luxurious flavors of smoky cherries and currants, roasted nuts, molasses and honey taste almost like an energy fruit bar from the health food store. This lovely, supple wine should develop through 2012.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A fine wine for dinner parties and important family reunions, this bright Barolo exudes elegance and finesse thanks to its delicate aromas of blue flower, dried lavender, cassis and forest berry. The wine is sheer and smooth with taut firmness on the close.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Pretty floral aromas accent notes of fennel and savory apple on this dry, crisp Riesling. Bright and bold on the palate, this has lemony acidity and an abundance of fresh apple flavor.",US-New York-Riesling
"Subdued aromas of hay, pineapple and crushed stone eventually unfold in the glass. The reserved but elegant palate shows honeydew melon, peach, citrus and mineral alongside crisp acidity.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sauvignon
"This wonderful wine showcases the blender's art. The grapes come from 11 appellations throughout the valley, and the wine, while notable for its delicious flavors, also is great in structure. It has soft tannins and refreshing acidity, and is entirely dry, with moderate alcohol. Those flavors include raspberry jam, cherry-vanilla cream, cinnamon and white pepper. So easy to like.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Mild, almost dilute aromas of strawberry and raspberry aren't fully convincing for Cabernet. In the mouth, however, this weighs in heavy and seeking balance. Flavors of berry and plum are baked, while candied sweetness and blueberry notes drive a jammy finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Made from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, this wine is overripe. Although it's dry and the tannins are fine, it's dominated by raisiny flavors.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Ah, subtlety and richness come together in this delicious, layered and creamy-textured wine. It has light aromas of marzipan and pear, more fully developed vanilla, nutmeg and pear tart flavors and a luscious mouthfeel that helps extend the finish.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Lots to like at this price. The wine is honeyed, with crisp acidity and ripe green apple and tropical fruit flavors. Easy to drink with ethnic fare, from Vietnamese to Indian and Mexican chicken dishes.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Muted black plum teases from the nose of this wine, a blend of 73% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 8% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot. Amidst a wall of dusty tannins still needing time to soften, you'll find clove, blackberry and a treasure trove of chocolate and vanilla.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Prima Volta (“first time”) is a fresh and easy wine, with medium intensity and bright aromas of honey, peach and white flower. The mouthfeel is lean and compact, but the persistent perlage keeps it lively.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"This is intensely rich, with very concentrated ripe fruit. Apple and peach flavors are cut by acidity. A note of pepper details the finish. Age for 3–4 years.",Austria-Kremstal-Grüner Veltliner
"Aromas of resin, nail polish remover and violet lead the nose while the nervous palate delivers raw red cherry, toasted oak, coconut and cooking spice. It lacks fruit richness and the bracing, astringent tannins give it a choppy finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This wine is a blend of Merlot (58%), Cabernet Sauvignon (36%), Cabernet Franc (5%) and Petit Verdot. Vibrant aromas of cherry meats, raspberry, dried herb and barrel spice are followed by a fruit-forward flavorful palate backed by firm tannins. It has a high yum factor.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A ripe, smooth wine, dominated by vanilla from wood and by red berry fruits. The tannic structure is subservient to the rich layers of mint and herbal flavors, while the fruit dominates. Finishes with chocolate and firm tannins.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Red Blend
"Measured aromas of wild berry and exotic spice are followed by smoky flavors of cured beef in this easy, crisp Ripasso. Offers more depth in the mouth than it does the nose.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Mint and tarragon come to the fore aromatically in this vineyard-designate, a soft, approachable mix of juicy plum, red berry and chocolate. Fuller in style and ripe, it'll do well on a table of grilled and roasted fare, finishing with a kick of black pepper.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lemon and tangerine aromas are slightly dusty. In the mouth, this Viura-Verdejo combo is lively and bouncy. Pithy citrus, almond-skin and apple flavors finish juicy.",Spain-Northern Spain-White Blend
"This is a real palate-pleaser. Forward, fresh flavors of cherry and plum are accented by light herb notes and finished with a frame of chocolate. It gains precision as it lengthens through the finish, showing medium weight and enough structure to continue to drink well through 2022.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This wine's oak, toasted nut and menthol aromas carry over to its evolved palate, along with a coffee note and bracing tannins. It's shy on fruit richness and intensity.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Subtle aromatics of earthy rose petal surround this silky, light wine, steeped in acidity and a damp-forested quality. Spicy throughout in cinnamon, cardamom and grated nutmeg, the wine picks up a girth of thickness on the finish, a knot of tannin that gives it a swath of complexity and cellaring possibilities, through 2018.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A lovely wine, teetering on the edge of sweetness. The pretty apple, apricot, and honeysuckle flavors have a crisp, steely edge of acidity, and there's a rich streak of mineral and diesel that adds complexity.",US-California-Riesling
"Delicious and easy-drinking, this straightforward wine opens with aromas of violets, wet soil and perfumed berries. On the palate, notes of white pepper and cinnamon add interest to the juicy, cherry-berry fruit. Fresh and smooth with silky tannins, it's best through 2015.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Both the juicy and the tart notes of ripe apple and freshly cut apple peel play on the nose. The palate follows with balanced, gentle sweetness: a play-off between apple ripeness and apple tartness. The notion is crisp and the body generous. The finish is delicate and the wine seems just off dry, although it is a proper late-harvest style. It would be an absolute winner with soft cheeses.",Austria-Burgenland-Austrian white blend
"This new release reflects the change of winemaking and ownership at Columbia. It's well-crafted, juicy and ripe with pleasing flavors of cranberry and currant. The acids are a little chalky, but clearly the wine has been made to reward earlier drinking rather than extended cellaring.",US-Washington-Merlot
"The nose of this wine is soft and toasty, with notes of sweet cream and butter. The creamy mouthfeel offers bursts of buttered popcorn, pineapple and toasted Challah. It's a nice choice if you like a round, buttery Chardonnay. The flavors, however, don't linger on the finish and instead turn slightly bitter.",US-Virginia-Chardonnay
"This is a wine that brings out a soft, tropical character allied to a citrus and a herbaceous element. It's open, attractive and soft, and it's ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Evident aromas of prune and raisin announce extreme ripeness. Like the nose, this feels ripe and chunky, with hard tannins. Jammy, extracted flavors of raisin and black plum are oaky and peppery prior to a pushy finish with heat.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Bonarda
"A tang of black cherry and citrus elevates the palate of this light-bodied wine, which is soft and well integrated in terms of oak and tannin. With 10% Petite Sirah and 8% Carignane, it's strong in leather and black pepper, with a lean, juicy finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Situated in the valley on the other side of the hill from Bandol and the sea, this estate has produced a ripe, full-bodied wine. The high proportion of Mourvèdre in the blend contributes a perfumed character and some structure. It is a complete, ripe and concentrated wine that will age, and will be better from late 2016.",France-Provence-Rosé
"A larger-production wine that doesn't hold back on quality, this offers a bittersweet bite of black tea, cranberry and dried herb atop aromas of dried rose petals, remaining varietal while also providing an oomph of body and texture.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The best word to describe this impressive Sangiovese-Merlot blend from Umbria is “healthy.” It has a vibrant, ruby red color and delivers absolutely immaculate aromas of succulent cherry, violet, balsamic notes, earth and root beer. It imparts soft, silky tannins, bright acidity and ends only after having carefully caressed each taste bud.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"Jammy but generic berry fruit aromas are crowded by lactic, pasty oak scents and vanilla. The wine is hard as cement in the mouth, with jagged tannins. Flavors of sun-baked raisin and plum fold in chocolate and rubbery notes on a grabby finish that includes residual resiny oak. This could use more time; try after 2016.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Rich and dense, this has blackberry and black cherry jam, mocha and spice flavors. It contains 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, which lends the wine weight and body. While it's technically dry, there's a sweetness that comes from the ripeness of fruit and the caramel flavor from the oak, which gives it a sugary, bacony taste. Delicious now and for a few years.",US-California-Merlot
"This big, ripe, fruity wine balances its fruit with a core of firm tannins. It's dense, with a dusty texture, a sweet blackberry-jam flavor and final acidity.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"If this blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier and Gewürztraminer were drier, it would earn a much higher score. It's clean and crisp in acidity, and very rich in tropical fruit, flower and spice flavors. But it's just too sweet in the finish, almost like a dessert wine.",US-California-White Blend
"Sourced from a 2001 planting of Dijon clone 777 vines, this is a dry, slightly leathery wine with tight flavors of dried figs dusted with cocoa and coffee grounds. It shows moderate depth and length, and seems ready for near-term drinking.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Structured and fruity, this has plenty of minerality to pair with the crisp citrus flavor. The wood influence gives it extra depth, while the crispness is preserved by a final steely thrust. This structured wine should age for four years or more",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"This wine offers attractive citrus and yellow-fruit flavors. It is fresh, with a richer backdrop of perfumed fruit. The texture brings out the ripeness.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"The Mother Vine Cabernet is drinking soft and easy now, with gentle tannins framing slightly herbaceous blackberry and black cherry flavors, touched with smoky oak. It feels like a wine you want to age, although the softness suggests it won't for long.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lavishly floral with notes of orange blossom and lemon candy, Konstantin Frank's Grüner Veltliner is another standout for the region. Dry and medium-bodied in style, the palate bursts with crisp white peach and nectarine against a backdrop of lime zest and mineral tones.",US-New York-Grüner Veltliner
"The wine is redolent of bright blueberry and cherry with a tonic, youthful berry feel in the mouth. This easy blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (60%), Syrah and Cabernet Franc would make the perfect companion to pizza or pasta.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"A bit unyielding on the nose, then the palate shows rather tight and citrusy flavors. Yet there's ample weight on the palate and a long, fresh finish tinged with hard peaches and pineapple. This seemingly contradictory wine just needs some time to develop; try after 2009.",Australia-New South Wales-Chardonnay
"Bright and fresh, with streamlined and compact fruit, Poggio Teo has the natural acidity to stand up to cheese- or cream-based dishes. It has light dustings of toasted nut and spice that give the palate added dimension.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Piquant black raspberry, sweet anise, thyme and game notes show on the nose of this bottling from a new brand that took over the Addamo Vineyards property. On the palate, there's a nice interplay between snappy cranberry fruit and the garrigue.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The oak is very present, so give this a few more years of cellar aging for it to integrate. Chocolate, Christmas spices, leather, toasted almonds and coffee grounds make a grand first impression. As the wine evolves in the glass, cherry and black currant aromas surface.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Forest fruit and pepper aromas lead into flavors of blackberry, cedar and spice. Elegant and exotic, this wine is balanced with good acidity and luscious fruit.",Greece-Nemea-Agiorgitiko
"Expensive, yes, but defines the soft, luxurious modern style of extreme deliciousness. Made with a drop of Petit Verdot that seems to add depth, the wine is fantastically rich in blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam, chocolate and sweet oak. The tannins are a wonder, and there's just enough acidity to give a balanced tang. Will it age? Yes, but for how long is the question. Beautiful now and through 2019.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Represents a big improvement over last year's Califa; this one returns to dryness thanks to the cool vintage. Edna Valley acidity brightens cherry, root beer, vanilla bean and oak flavors. Dry and complex now, the wine should peak in a year or so, then hold through 2010.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"There are true, varietal scents of apricot, peach and honeysuckle. Fresh fruit in the mouth shows crisp, citrus and orange flavors, with some spritzyness on the tongue, and plenty of orange rind in the finish. This is fruity and dry enough to be well suited to spicy foods.",US-Washington-Gewürztraminer
"Made with organically farmed grapes, this opens with earthy aromas of ripe black fruit and whiffs of barnyard. The rustic palate offers fleshy black cherry, crushed raspberry and gamey notes alongside rather fleeting tannins.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"A new bottling from the winery, made from vines grown 2,000 feet up the mountain that were planted only in 2001. It's far too immature to drink now or anytime soon. The tannins are thick and on lockdown, the blackberry, cassis and cherry fruit all primary and not yet integrated with the oak. But these parts are high-quality and need time to mesh and develop. Best after 2010 through 2016 and beyond.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Rich, plummy and oaky, this wine combines 52% Zinfandel and 48% Petite Sirah. The two varieties pack a punch of intensity and a plush mouthfeel, finishing with a touch of heat.",US-California-Red Blend
"As Willamette Valley vintners continually improve and redefine Oregon Chardonnay, a distinctive profile is emerging. This vivid and taut mineral-driven wine could be the poster child. The citrus, apples and pears bring a light touch of baking spices, extended length and surefire ageability. Plus, it's a fine value for a wine of such quality.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Raspberry and clove characterize the nose on this single-vineyard bottling. The palate kicks off with vibrant black cherry, slips toward black olive on the midpalate and ends with bright acidity on a decent finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Here's a wine that shows the aging potential of Nebbiolo. This Barolo offers layers of dried currant, cassis, licorice, natural rubber, white spirit and a dusty, black mineral element. It's a very linear and sharply focused wine that flaunts its power and persistency. A crisp, firm finish suggests the wine will continue to age.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Concentrated and dense, with bold red fruit, deep spice notes and overtones of tobacco, bresaola, leather and cigar box. It's a bold, masculine wine but restrained and elegant at the same time. Despite the bold bouquet, the mouthfeel is rather compact and firm. It leaves the palate refreshed.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese Grosso
"Tropical fruit aromas meld with a whiff of Mediterranean herb. The bright, simple palate shows hints of banana and citrus, alongside zesty acidity.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Grillo
"This 100% Viognier shows the variety's exotic side, with delicious tropical fruit, citrus, pear, melon, lychee and smoky oak flavors. It's a bit one-dimensional, but appeals for its fresh acids and richness.",US-California-Viognier
"Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot each make up 43% of this blend, with the balance Syrah. Somewhat reticent aromas of herb, red apple, cherry and spice lead to smooth silky red and black-fruit flavors. It brings a lot of appeal.",US-Washington-Red Blend
Light wood aging sets the scene for this crisp and herbaceous wine. Citrus fruits give a juicy character and contrast with the mineral texture coming from the stony vineyard. It's a fresh wine to drink now.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This is very appealing for the soft, sexy texture and drink-me-now black currant flavors, but it's lacking the acid-tannin structure that great Napa Cab needs. Drink now and for a few years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Most 2006 Chilean Chardonnays are past their prime, but Montes Alpha still shows vitality along with rich aromas and flavors of pear, banana and barrel-driven toast. The feel is smooth and pure, while the flavors run straight to ripe apple, banana nut bread and buttered toast. Firm and holding steady on the finish, although it's probably best to drink immediately while the wine is still kicking.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Chardonnay
"From the mountains above Lake Sonoma, this rocky, robust and ultimately rewarding wine is spicy in cinnamon and clove lined in savory layers of black pepper and leather. Brambly blackberry lies in wait to untangle in the glass, adding to the overall satisfaction of this full-bodied beauty.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Okay for everyday purposes, if you're at a party sipping the house wine from a paper cup. Dry and rugged, with blackberry and cherry flavors and a sharp finish.",US-California-Merlot
"This is an excellent vintage, with delicate licorice shadings laced over blackberry, coffee, chocolate and root beer. It's intense and concentrated with some animal- or meat-like aromas that are within acceptable limits.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"The vintage was a good one for Peju, resulting in wines that bear the winery's distinctive style of balanced elegance. This reserve is very ripe and flamboyant in blackberry and black currant flavors, with an opulent overlay of toasty oak. This is so delicious that it tastes like there's a squirt of milk chocolate in it, but the wine is, in fact, thoroughly dry.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Woody, heady black-fruit aromas are charred and minty. The palate is dense and tannic, while charred, earthy black-fruit flavors show herbal after tones prior to a dry and woody finish. A bit of time in the cellar should help this integrate and fully come together; drink after 2018 and through 2022.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A problematic wine. It starts out with an inert aroma that's mainly caramelized wood. In the mouth it's sweet and simple, with cola, blackberry, Dr. Pepper and cocoa flavors, and some bitterness on the finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"The first vintage from Quinta de la Rosa's new joint venture with winemaker Jorge Moreira in the high Douro. It's rich, sweet, opulent, with tarry tannins and delicious black fruit. The tannins are just a supplement to the fruit.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Grippy and surrounded in a thick, leathery texture and aroma, it holds bright cranberry tones underneath the thickness, making this a palatable Cabernet.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lighter in color and density, this wine shows smoked berries, rust and iodine on the nose. The palate is decorated with black olives, smoked cherries and more sanguine elements.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a smoky, fragrant wine that offers dense fruit and firm tannins. It has the structure of a fine Gevrey and the concentration of the vintage. This is classic and worth aging for 4–5 years.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This wine seems a bit reduced right out of the bottle. Give it plenty of oxygen, and light blueberry fruit flavors emerge. The aging in 60% new French oak brings in a lot of barrel flavors that seem mismatched with the light fruit.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Brown sugar and buttered toast flavors dominate this wine, but it's not cloying, because it has lots of acidity. The mango, tangerine and peach flavors testify to exceptional ripeness.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Smoky, toasted walnut aromas and oaky flavors make this full-bodied wine taste like the volume is turned up loud. It feels firmly tannic and broad on the palate, its toasted oak qualities coating the mouth and lingering on the finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Named after the fortress at Blaye on the banks of the Gironde, the wine is easygoing and approachable. It has generous black-currant fruits, shot through with acidity, and is given structure by some dense tannins. Drink this wine from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Opens with rubber, smoke, leather and coffee aromas, then the fruit comes in on the palate, which is juicy and correct, with tight, fresh red-fruit flavors and notes of ripe tomato and pepper flake. Finishes spicy and dry, with a crispness that'll make it 100% food-friendly.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This young fresh red has aromas of dark berry and a whiff of blue flower while the easy-drinking palate offers wild cherry and a hint of spice. It's extremely simple, so drink soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"While there is plenty of acidity in this wine, it also has red fruit character that conveys a ripe, full feeling. It's juicy and fruity, crisp but still warm at the end.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Dusty berry, resin and bell-pepper aromas suggest a marginally ripe wine with plenty of oak. A raw punchy choppy mouth feel and woody spicy plum and berry flavors are good but not very deep or evolved. A finish with hard tannins is par for the course.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Of all the Angosto 2011s, El Jefe del Tribu is the most smoky and roasted of the group. Savory aromas of beef jerky and baked blackberry filter onto a ripe, slightly flat palate. Flavors of baked black fruits are gritty and mildly stalky, while the finish tastes of cooked berry fruits and generic blackness.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"Champoux and Ciel du Cheval vineyards each make up 40% of this wine, with the balance coming from Gamache. It's locked-up tightly at present with earth, tar, cherry, high-toned herb and barrel-spice aromas leading to focused black-fruit flavors that display elegance and persistence. Give it time to open up.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is composed of five varieties, with none making up more than 21% of the blend. Fresh aromas of berry, cranberry, red currant and herbs are followed by fruit-forward cherry and berry flavors that bring appeal.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This is a serious wine with a lighter brighter side. Its wood aging adds spice to the ripe red fruits and brings out the concentration and intensity. It is, in its way, an unexpected side of Provence rosé, emphasizing richness and complexity. But it all comes together: a fine wine that, after a year of aging, is ready to drink.",France-Provence-Rosé
"A vivid yellow-gold color and creamy, butterscotchy flavors pile up the richness in this full-bodied wine. Great underlying acidity lifts up the wine for good balance and a lasting, tingly finish. The concentration and creaminess are wonderful to taste.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Fruity and fresh, this easygoing semidry Riesling offers heaps of sweet peach and citrus flavors. It's not complex, but is crisply balanced with a clean, refreshing finish. Drink now.",Germany-Nahe-Riesling
"This golden Chardonnay is loaded with rich, oaky aromas of corn pudding, butterscotch, baked apple and wood grain. Plump and soft on the palate, this tastes of baked apple, creamed corn and buttery oak, with popcorn to the finish. Drink through 2017.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"This could be labeled Cabernet Sauvignon; the only other grape in the blend is a 14% Cab Franc component. Rich black cherry fruit provides the solid base, but after that the wine tightens down, so decanting would be essential if you plan to drink it soon. The scents weave together black fruits, spices and licorice; more than any of the other new releases from Soos Creek, this needs more time to settle.",US-Washington-Red Blend
La Court represents a bigger and meatier style of Barbera d'Asti with good concentration and a parade of wild fruit and smoked bacon aromas. The wine has piquant acidity on the close and would pair with creamy lasagna or asparagus with béchamel sauce.,Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"This is a bold and powerful wine with distinctive green notes that recall dried grass, black pepper and spice. It also has bitter chocolate, cardamom and cumin and its tannins are so strong, they literally leave your palate parched and dry.",Italy-Central Italy-Sagrantino
"The oak is very present, so give this a few more years of cellar aging for it to integrate. Chocolate, Christmas spices, leather, toasted almonds and coffee grounds make a grand first impression. As the wine evolves in the glass, cherry and black currant aromas surface.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This lovely wine offers classic elements of cedar and tar built around a medium-bodied weight of soft, complex texture. Smoky oak never detracts from the layering of black licorice and blackberry that builds as it goes, this wine defined most by its substantial length.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Creamy smooth and enlivened with brisk acidity, this Chard shows forward, tart green apple, lime and pineapple flavors. Oak barrels add even richer notes of buttered toast and butterscotch to this elegant sipper.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Dusty and nuanced with soft aromas of cocoa, dried raspberry and cherry, reminiscent of a chocolate cherry latte from Starbucks. Light weight in the mouth with approachable tannins and a clean, dry finish. Drink now.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rhône-style Red Blend
"The addition of 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Cabernet Franc add an apparent spiciness and structure to this young, tightly wound wine that's otherwise showy with oak and savory clove notes. Firm tannins and a strong streak of dried herb and cedar add to the mix.",US-California-Merlot
"The perfect summer apéritif, this light, fresh, crisp wine tastes just drier than previous vintages, allowing the apple and lemon fruits to shine even more. It has a tight, taut aftertaste, leaving the mouth clean and refreshed. Screwcap.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Portuguese White
"A good, robust, everyday Zinfandel, with some special features. It's soft and dry and very flavorful, offering waves of raspberries, cherries, mocha, spices and sandalwood. Gets a few extra points for the finely ground tannins and clean, brisk scour of acidity.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Dusty and dry, this wine uses a higher percentage of Sangiovese than Luce and the result is a tougher, more austere wine that gets much of its character from dried spice and toast. Understated and restrained, you can almost taste the influence of co-creator Tim Mondavi.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"With hard, cutting tannins and watery fruit, this Cab is notable for astringency and acidity. There's very little going on, except it is dry.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Hints of tropical fresh fuit and flowers lends an exotic touch to this pretty wine, and on the palate, it offers balanced elements of crisp fruit and spicy oak. Not terribly complex but a friendly food wine.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"Produced from 40-year old vines, this smooth, rich wine oozes black plums, sweet spices and an undertow of dry tannins. With its fresh acidity, it is immediately appetizing, leaving juicy currants lingering in the mouth. Screwcap.",Austria-Burgenland-Austrian Red Blend
"A very rich wine—this has a warm, soft mouthfeel and ripe, jammy flavors enhanced with oak. Except for the heat, it's a lovely wine. Drink now.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A 100% varietal, single-vineyard wine, aged nearly two years in French oak, 65% new, this is expansive in chalky red fruit and rustic saddle leather notes, the tannins billowy and round. A rich cocoa-like undertone plays nicely on the palate.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Crisp green aromas suggest lime and then passion fruit. It's lively and spritzy in the mouth, with high acidity yielding green flavors that transition to pithy and heavy. Lemon-lime mixed with celery notes come up on the finish.",Chile-San Antonio-Sauvignon Blanc
"Made entirely with the native grape Bombino Nero, this informal light-bodied wine has subdued aromas of wild cherry and a hint of crushed herb. The aromas carry over to the über-simple palate along with a hint of pink grapefruit.",Italy-Southern Italy-Rosé
"Aromas of Golden Delicious apples, nectarine flesh, lemon-lime soda and poached pears drizzled lightly with agave syrup show on the nose of this wine made by Mike Roth. The palate offers apple and pear cider along with white peach and a steely, nearly gunmetal minerality.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"Like almost every wine in Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbec series, Ambrosia is concentrated and deep, with potent aromas of wood smoke, lemon peel, blackberry and tar. This feels layered and plush, while flavors of wild berry, dark spices, coffee and mocha finish with a blast of chocolate and nutmeg. Drink through 2018.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This wine's coffee, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, coconut, herb and cherry aromas are followed by a rich, full bodied palate loaded with black fruit flavors and generous barrel accents. Its oak influence seems prominent at times but doesn't stand in the way of its hedonistic appeal.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc
"Steel and nervy mineralogy are the hallmarks of this wine at this stage. It's still waiting for the fruit to develop, but expect crisp citrus and succulent apples. The aftertaste, tensely fresh now, should soften as the wine develops. This 90% Sauvignon Blanc and 10% Sémillon blend comes from the estate's small vineyard on the slope near Cadillac.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Herbal, almost medicinal aromas set a complex scene for this densely structured wine. The flavors throughout, while rich, are also severe, a wrinkle on the otherwise ripe façade. That certainly suggests aging, and the dry tannins support this. In the meantime, it is a winter wine, its concentration needing rich meat dishes.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"This is fresh, bright and majoring on slightly stony, flinty lemon notes on a slender body. Drink soon, it will provide ample refreshment.",Austria-Kamptal-Riesling
"Fresh on the nose, with red cherry and apple skin aromas. This feels rather sharp and acidic, with flavors of tart cherry pie and red plum.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"Tasted in early December, this Cabernet, which was blended with Merlot and Petit Verdot, was in a funny place in its evolution. It's not exactly fresh and fruity, but it hasn't evolved to the complexity of an aged wine. You'll find plenty of restrained blackberry, cherry, currant, violet, oak and tannic notes that require another 6–8 years to resolve and shine.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Comenge, which is headquartered in nearby Ribera del Duero, has branched out into Rueda with this lean, clean Verdejo that opens with citrus aromas and a tight mouthfeel. Stony tangerine and lemony flavors turn salty and briny on a light finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"Notes of raisins, dried prunes and chocolate mark this dry, tannic Cabernet. It's pretty acidic, with a sharp finish that contains heat from the high alcohol. Drink up.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A special cuvée of Château Siaurac, this is dark, dense, seriously young at this stage, but destined for a powerful, rich, black fruit and tannin future. It has weight and concentration, layered with new wood and acidity. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Merlot
"It's 100% Merlot, and it doesn't need any help from any other grapes. Extremely dark and thick in the mouth, this liquorous bruiser of a Merlot is thoroughly delicious. It's just packed with fruit, cassis and ripe black cherries, complemented by dark chocolate notes.",US-Washington-Merlot
"This is a rustic style of Shiraz, with hints of beef bouillon and cola layered over earth and plum notes. Chewy tannins bring it home, suggesting a pairing with rare roasts.",Australia-New South Wales-Shiraz
"Defines a Dry Creek Valley style of Zinfandel, with high alcohol, a heady full-bodiedness, and massive flavors of wild berries, currants, raisins, spices and earthy elements. Drink it over the next 3–4 years, before the fruit starts to turn.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This Syrah is exceptionally rich with flavors of cherries, blackberries, mocha and smoked meat, all touched with a hint of oak. It's tannins and acids provide excellent structure. A deliciously complex wine to drink now and over the next few years.",US-California-Syrah
This wine offers an aged quality to its accompanying freshness. A taste of honey and dried apple surround soft layers of citrus and a toasted oak finish.,US-California-Chardonnay

"This wine is produced from two of the quintas owned by Ramos-Pinto. It's fruity and crisp, packed with bright fruit and lively acidity, and finishes on tangy citrus with a riper, creamy texture. Drink from late 2017.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese White
"An opening blitz of stalky, rustic, leathery berry aromas comes with overt oak. This is high in acidity, but with only average body weight it comes across raw and sharp. Bright, juicy red-fruit flavors vie with stalky, baked notes prior to a loamy finish that runs low on vibrancy.",Chile-Maule Valley-Carignan
"Ripe and richly fruity, this fragrant Doublet family wine offers spice, floral aromas and a crisp texture. It is well balanced, lively and ready to drink.",France-Bordeaux-Rosé
"This opens with aromas of toast, hazelnut and a whiff of adhesive bandage. The raw rather bitter palate shows unripe sour cherry, strawberry and a medicinal note alongside vivacious—almost harsh—bubbles and marked acidity.",Italy-Lombardy-Pinot Nero
"Ripe and fruity, this immediately attractive wine has a crisp texture, giving prominence to apple and grapefruit freshness. The light spritz from bottling from the lees adds bright lift to the aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"Luscious honey tangerine and grapefruit flavors abound in this delightfully quaffable off-dry Riesling. Buoyant fruit is off set neatly by a backbone of high-toned acidity and suble nuances of pollen and crushed mineral. It's sprightly and pert, finishing brisk and dry.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Black pepper and rosemary aromas join forces with black cherry and blackberry flavors in this well-balanced, moderately tannic wine. It has a refreshing quality, tasty fruit and medium body, all of which will make it versatle with food.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"From a meticulously farmed site, this robust wine is intense and powerful, with a baked fruit component that makes it compelling and delicious. Forest floor, sage and rhubarb jam notes enwrap its concentrated weight and texture, with an underlying acidity that tingles the tongue.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Black cherry and blackberry aromas are ripe, with a touch of prune weighing in. In the mouth, punchy acidity sticks out. Wiry raspberry and plum flavors are surprisingly tart and underdeveloped, while lactic oak notes and choppy acidity make for a jumbled finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Dusty minerals, pollen and spice notes lend complexity to this honey-toned auslese. The palate is decadently sweet, glazed in caramelized sugar and heaving with ripe cantaloupe and peach flavors. A bite of lemon-lime acidity offsets all the opulence, lending edge to a long, lingering finish.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"The heady, pure perfume of fig rind and foliage streams from the glass. A more tart and tropical note of passion fruit pitches in as well, along with green grapefruit spice. The aromatic spectrum is a sublimation of exotic fruit on nose and palate. The palate sustains this high-pitched balance by the purest lightening strike of zesty acidity. Even the tiniest drop of this amber liquid has the power to perfume the entire palate for minutes. The concentration is immense, the flavors are mind-boggling. This is high-octane stuff guaranteed to blow your mind. Drink now or cellar it through 2040 at least.",Austria-Burgenland-White Blend
"A barrel-fermented Chardonnay with creamy texture, this opens with bright, prominent Meyer lemon notes before delving into softer flavors of pear and vanilla on the midpalate. The acidity holds through to the finish, accented by a touch of honey.",US-California-Chardonnay
"One of Bouchard's signature wines, this is beautifully textured, a series of bright fruits, strawberries and sweet acidity. There are tannins, but this is lighter than in some vintages, a wine for short-term aging.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"A big wine, ripe and explosive in fruit. Maybe too fruity, almost a bomb. Raspberries and cherries, sweetened with oak, dominate. Could use greater subtlety and restraint, not to mention grounding earthiness.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Smells oaky, with smoky vanilla and sweet, charred notes riding high over flamboyant tropical fruit aromas, including guavas and breadfruit. This is a big wine, but the pieces aren't all in place. It's like a symphony orchestra playing different tunes. Give it a few months to knit together.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"A beautiful evocation of Washington fruit, it has concentration, balance and structure, and the clean berry/cherry fruit is amplified by polished tannins, bright acids and light splashes of peppery spice. This is one of the finest pure Washington Merlots to be released in many years.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Taut and spicy, showing pear and savory tones, this is a slender but archetypal Grüner with a spring in its step. The palate is toned but full of verve with bundled citrus at its core. The liveliness belies the seriousness of the concentrated palate. This is a joy.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"This lean and bracing wine offers raw cherry and powdered sage notes. Astringent, raspy tannins leave a dry finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"An unfortunate green, vegetal streak cuts through the heart of this Pinot Noir. It blurs the cherry fruit and detracts from the fine silky texture.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Made in an off-dry style, this Riesling has honeyed flavors of a fruit juice blend of oranges, peaches and apples. It's simple, but crisp acidity contributes vital balance.",US-California-Riesling
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (61%), Merlot (25%) and Cabernet Franc, the aromas of spice, graphite, vanilla, and dried and fresh herbs are all high toned, with the fruit seeming subdued. The flavors are pitch-black, displaying the warmth of the vintage while keeping its heat in check.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Hugh Hamilton proves that Yalumba's success with this tricky variety isn't a fluke, offering genuine Viognier expression at a realistic price. Ripe muskmelon and apricot notes leave a round, full-bodied impression on the palate, finishing with musky spice. Drink now.",Australia-South Australia-Viognier
"Fiery and borderline herbaceous aromas are green-leaning, which is surprising considering that 2011 was a warm, dry, highly regarded vintage in Rioja. On the palate, this feels strained, with outsized acidity. Herbal, roasted wild-berry flavors come with a lot of oak and clove, while the finish is fairly tart and herbal.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"An unusual blend of Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache, this wine displays aromas of pencil lead, blackberry and coffee. It drinks off dry, with a plush feel to the fruit flavors that help it go down easy.",US-Washington-Red Blend

"Inky dark and tannic now, this 100% Cabernet, aged in 50% new French oak barrels, seems aimed for the cellar. It's tough as nails now, but has an enormous heart of cassis. Give this low-production wine a good 4–6 years of aging.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A bouquet of black cherry, toffee and violet sets the stage for flavors of black cherry, coffee, caramel and soft notes of mint. Acidity and tannins are well balanced, and the appealing finish features bright notes of lightly caramelized fruit and soft touches of mint.",Israel-Galilee-Shiraz
"Juicy brambleberries, red currants, black pepper and a touch of asphalt greet the nose on this stylishly packaged wine made by Andrew Murray. Dried anise seeds and minty blueberry show on the somewhat lean and lithe palate.",US-California-Red Blend
"Aromas of cocoa, dark cherry, baker's chocolate and graphite rise up from the glass. The flavors are dense and full, with firm chewy tannins backing them up. It should only improve with additional time in bottle. Best after 2020.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
Aromas of green apple carry over to the fresh simple palate along with vanilla and a confectionary note. Vigorous persistent bubbles generate a frothy perlage.,Italy-Veneto-Glera

"Textured and medium bodied, this wine has a simplicity of citrus and peachy stone fruit buoyed by bright acidity. Fermented entirely in stainless steel, it was aged in concrete, stainless steel and French oak. It displays the concentration of the vintage.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This wine is a unique blend of Viognier, Sauvignon Blanc, Grenache Blanc, Sémillon and Marsanne. Light aromas of melon and citrus lead to dry full-feeling fruit flavors that bring a rounded feel. It's an intriguing wine.",US-Washington-White Blend

"This is Brian Carter's Southern Rhône-influenced blend, which is comprised of 50% Grenache, 22% Syrah, 19% Mourvèdre, 6% Counoise and 3% Cinsault. Expressive aromas put the emphasis on bright berries that are annotated with baking spice, toast and a hint of forest leaf. This is complex and forward, with excellent balance and structure. The finish fades gently with a hint of anise.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Reduced, and cradled in big oak, this wine is spiky and savory, intense and tart, with a densely overripe notion of syrupy cherry and berry.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"This is Long Shadows's 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, offering a sharp-edged wine with a brilliant mix of berry, cherry and black fruits, sparked by juicy acids. There's spice and chocolate highlights as well, with a purity and focus that suggests cellaring to add more complexity over the course of a decade or longer.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Alta Maria's appellation bottling is a bit leaner than the winery's single-vineyard bottlings, but quite elegant, with flint, pink grapefruit, mango and spearmint flavors, enhanced by a touch of oak.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Made in a powerful, almost dry style with 12% alcohol, this is not a typical kabinett. The aromas boast admirably pure pear and pineapple scents, but the flavors show slaty, spicy complexity—this is much more than simply fruity. The texture is creamy and the lingering finish shows off more spice and stones. Might age, but it's so impressive now, why wait?",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this straightforward wine offers aromas of forest floor, violet, red berry and spices. The juicy palate delivers ripe black fruit accented with notes of white pepper, cinnamon, black tea and clove alongside firm but ripe tannins. Enjoy this now through 2018.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This is a rugged, dark and meaty version of Pinot Noir, so don't look for elegance or finesse. It's showing musky flavors of fig and plum, with a background of underbrush and ample tannins. Tasty enough, though lacking in varietal specificity.",US-Washington-Pinot Noir
"This winery is making one of the best cases for Pinot Noir in the Paso Robles area. This bottling, which is quite dark in color, starts with black plum, mulberry, wet loam and a strong sense of umami on the nose, with hints of nori and teriyaki. The palate shows tart black-plum-skin flavors alongside juniper and more moist, turned-earth flavors. The acidity is persistent and tannins firm enough.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Nice and ripe, with cassis, blackberry and some oaky softness up front. The palate is convincing and properly textured, and it deals tasty cassis and plum-like flavors. Across the board this wine is comfortable and comforting; it finishes short but composed, with honest Malbec color, feel and flavor components.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A beautifully rich and rewarding expression of tropical fruit and creamy texture, this estate white spends nine months in large French oak casks and is selected from the best lots. Supporting acidity keeps it refreshing in waves of lime and grapefruit.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of toasted oak, chamomile and acacia flower lead the nose. The round palate offers yellow apple skin, dried tropical fruit, oak, coffee and a butterscotch note alongside well-integrated acidity. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit.",Italy-Central Italy-Verdicchio
"The 2006 vintage was erratic, but Nick Goldschmidt has pulled a rabbit out of a hat with this fabulously complex and rewarding 100% Cabernet. It's classic Oakville, dry, tannic and elegant, and the way the blackberry and black currant flavors marry the new oak is simply wonderful. The Game Ranch Vineyard has been source to some of Goldschmidt's greatest Cabernets over the past decade. This is one of those wines that's compelling to drink now, but should evolve over the next 10–15 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Akin to a fresh basket of strawberries picked up at the farmer's market, this Grenache Rosé is intensely floral and fruity. A touch of blood orange peeks through, along with a flirty herbal streak and dry, soft textures. Light and bright, it offers a slight effervescence.",US-California-Rosé
"A good evocation of a Santa Ynez Grenache. Shows the right bite of acidity, with interesting cherry pie, bacon and sandalwood flavors that lead to a long, spicy finish. Drink up.",US-California-Grenache
"A crazy amount of peppercorn, from white to black to green to red, pops on the nose of this bottling by the legendary Adam Tolmach. Aromas also convey dried violet, black gravel and the slightest touch of blueberry. The pepper spice is almost unbelievable on the sip, where it spices up the soy and coffee-bean flavors.",US-California-Syrah
"Tasted in May of 2012, this shows an immaturity, where all the parts haven't yet come together. It has a big, rich black-cherry flavor, with elaborate smoky oak, brisk acidity, firm tannins and heat from the alcohol all vying for dominance. Needs time; cellar it until 2015.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This opens with floral aromas of violet and rose bud, followed by light berry and plum notes. The palate tastes easy and fresh.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"Big and rich, this wine is exuberantly fruity with a sweet juicy core of ripe blackberry. Big, bold and forward with well-integrated tannins, this is likely to age quickly; try in 2–3 years.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"Displaying a ripe, multifaceted nose with violets, cumin, licorice, tar and chocolate elements, this wine shows class and grace with classic dry cherry flavors.  Possessing lovely weight and balance, it is full without being heavy, and finishes with dusty rose and even tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This is the workhorse release from an always dependable producer, and it's excellent.

Vibrant and alive, with high acidity that endows it with marvelous structure.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Castello d'Albola's Chianti Classico has a typical fragrance of ripe berry accented with hints of violet and spice. The bright palate delivers ripe, red cherry and white pepper along with round tannins. Pair it with pasta topped with ragù or barbecued steaks.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"A fine combination of tannins and ripe fruit, rich and at the same time solidly structured. The year brings out soft acidity and blackberry juice, and the wine finishes big and bold.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Smoky cherry and earth aromas are the opening salvo on this bullish yet well-made wine. Expect a full mouthfeel that wraps itself around toasty, creamy flavors of chocolaty plum and spiced tea. Barda excels on its lively finish, which is long, properly acidic and spicy tasting.",Argentina-Other-Pinot Noir
"Barnyard aromas atop berry scents make for a nose that's not entirely clean. A clipped, tough palate has hard tannins and short berry flavors. A finish with heat and bitterness makes this a tough go.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
A densely firm wine with fine perfumed fruit. The fruit and acidity ride well with the firm tannins and the restrained wood element. It is well balanced and likely to age for several years.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A bold white wine, it smells and tastes like grapefruit, canteloupe and very crisp apples. It has a fresh, acidic texture that cleans the palate and makes the mouth water, but wraps in enough richness for good balance.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Shows a welcome return to form, with lush, oak-inspired flavors of grilled pineapples, apricots and mulled green apple cider. This is a very good price for a Chardonnay of this quality.",US-California-Chardonnay

"An unusual blend of Zinfandel and Merlot, this is a softly fruity wine of great charm and appeal.

It's easy to like and immediately drinkable, yet possesses enough richness and complexity for the best tables.",US-California-Red Blend
"Full-on banana aromas create a wine that tastes like an elderly nouveau. It does have some fruit and red cherries, but with a bitter edge, it really should have been drunk by now.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Ripe red-cherry and strawberry aromas are lifted by grated clove and mace spice on the inviting nose of this bottling by longtime Winemaker Eric Hickey.

"Light but inviting aromas of lemon juice, apple flesh, ripe nectarine and crushed white rocks show on the nose of this bottling from Malibu. Sea-salt flavor appears throughout the palate, where pear and nectarine flesh meet with vanilla-butter-on-toast flavors. Nicely textured it's quite mouthwatering.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This is tight to the point of being shut down. Scents of skin phenolics suggest pear and apple fruit, but there's little flesh on these bones, and the wine stubbornly refuses to open up, even after several hours of breathing time.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"The work of award-winning winemaker Renzo Cotarella shows through in this wine's modern, bright purple color, its new wood and ripe fruit aromas and in the juicy blackberry and berry fruit flavors. Yet it is certainly not just modern glitz: Lurking behind is the real heart of a tough, ageworthy, tannic Brunello, which promises a good 10 years at least before being ready to drink.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Made in a big, bold, full-bodied style, this blend is showy in juicy blackberry, cedar and currant, flavors that are surrounded by firm, integrated tannin. A taste of cigar and chocolate gives the end note a nightcap kind of feel.",US-California-Red Blend

"Aromas of blue flower, wild berry, a hint of leather and brimstone lead the nose on this full-bodied wine.

Drink 2017–2022.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"This is a very zesty Grüner where yeasty, earthy notes are completely cut through with the wonderful, bracing freshness of grapefruit peel. The more usual fruit of green pears lurks underneath but the overall picture is one of lip-smacking refreshment. Wonderfully clean and zingy finish.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"Sweet rosé from the Vinho Verde region, this has some fresh raspberry and a light prickle to make it just that extra bit refreshing.",Portugal-Vinho Verde-Rosé

"Not that much Hunter Shiraz makes it to the U.S. these days, but this bottling from Wyndham Estate is a nice example. It shows rather clean winemaking, with strong vanilla and cedar notes from barrel aging to go alongside blueberry and blackberry fruit. Only mildly tannic, so it's approachable now, but should age through at least 2012.",Australia-New South Wales-Shiraz
"A blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Canaiolo, this discloses aromas of red berries, wet leaves and balsamic herbs. The smooth palate offers sour cherry and black raspberry accented with notes of white pepper and clove. Enjoy now through 2016.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Lovely fragrances of pressed powder, black berries, rose and tilled soil waft from the glass. The firm palate offers wild cherry, raspberry, cinnamon, licorice and savory herb alongside tightly knit but refined tannins. Fresh acidity balances this out but it's still young and not fully developed. Drink 2020–2030.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Ample aromas of dark berry, pipe tobacco, pressed violet and a balsamic note come together on this single-vineyard selection. On the structured palate, an energizing mineral vein wraps around mature black cherry, licorice, cinnamon and dried herb while a hint of game adds depth. This has years ahead of it. Drink 2018–2027.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling from tech power couple T.J. and Valeta Rodgers offers rich aromas of dried Mission fig, elderberry and black cherry, along with clay, loam and purple flowers. There is an impressive, almost muddy thickness to the palate, without being sweet or rich at all, showing flavors thyme, dill, mint and lavender against a core of dark red fruit.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is mucky and sweet. Its best foot is not put forward via the compost-like nose, and from then on there's little more than prune, leather and a sticky mouthfeel.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"This high-wire wine skirts along tart red fruits with a stiff herbal spine. Sourced from Lange Estate, Freedom Hill and Yamhill vineyards, it was aged in 40% new French oak. A nice streak of espresso, licorice and char completes the finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"An appealing pale salmon color, this blend of 50% Cinsault, 28% Grenache and 22% Syrah displays aromas of strawberry, cherry Jolly Rancher and melon. Reflective of the warmth of the vintage, it's fruitier than recent vintages but it's still hard to put down.",US-Washington-Rosé

"Crisp and minerally up front, with aromas of apple, peach and dust. It's fresh, maybe a touch basic at its core, with flavors of apple cider, apricot and almond skins. There's nothing not to like about this Albariño, which is pure, pithy on the finish, and more than solid in a pedestrian, familiar sort of way.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño

"Leathery and rubbery at first, with aromatic accents of celery seed, barnyard and melted tar. The palate is lighter than the nose, with herbal plum flavors and a lean, strained body. Thin and fresh, but nothing special.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"An ambitious Cabernet that's part of Raymond's program of highlighting individual appellations within Napa Valley. This wine is delicious, exhibiting rich, deep flavors of black currants with tasteful accents of oak. While it's fine to drink now, the tannins and long finish suggest up to eight years in the cellar will be beneficial.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Sweet oak tones frame the black cherry and currant fruit in this wine, with notes of mocha and raspberry sauce atop. The velvety texture offers good tannic grip, while ample acidity helps to keep the palate fresh and the finish lifted. Drink now.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Paso Robles-based Alma Sol reaches into Napa Valley for its Cabernet, with good results. The wine is dry, full-bodied and smooth, with rich flavors of blackberries, currants, dark chocolate and spices. Nice now, after a good decanting, and it should develop bottle complexities over 5–6 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A parcel of 40-year-old vines, this is a full, ripe wine that balances a tangy texture with rich yellow fruits. There is a mineral background along with fine acidity. The wine is impressive, full both of fruit and structure. It is ready to drink, rich and concentrated.",France-Loire Valley-Melon

"When O. Fournier tackles a new project, such as Sauvignon Blanc from Leyda, it doesn't mess around. This is an excellent example of Chilean SB with green fruit, citrus and a light touch of capsicum. It's a serious wine that challenges with its peppery crispness offset by grapefruit and green melon. Very nice mouthfeel; shows itself in a couple of waves.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Sauvignon Blanc

"From the southern part of Nuits-Saint-Georges, this small premier cru has produced a dark and structured wine with plenty of dry tannins that need to age. It is concentrated and firm, the tannins backed up by generous black-plum fruits. Drink this wine from 2022.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"This is a lovely bottle from this Idaho producer with notes of hay, butter, spice and melon. It has a broad, creamy feel that lingers on the finish.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"Aromas suggesting baked plum, menthol, aromatic herb and dark cooking spice lead the nose.

Drink 2018–2025.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend

"Aromas of plum, violets, orange peel, earth and herb are followed by palate-staining fruit flavors. A lengthy finish caps it off.",US-Washington-Syrah
"A good value among spätlesen, Mönchhof's 2005 Mosel Slate avoids the superripeness of the vintage, instead staying true to type.

"Soft vanilla hints of oak creep into the mossy aromatic hints of green and yellow pear. There also is a generous core of ripe fruit, almost reminiscent of lychee. While this is fresh with citrus, the deep mellowness and gliding fluidity of the palate will win you over. The finish is clean and lasting.",Austria-Wagram-Grüner Veltliner
"A blend of several vineyards in the famous Middle Reach stretch of the warmer, northwestern arm of the Russian River Valley, this is a beautiful wine to drink now.

"Lifted, fresh notes of peach on nose and palate somehow manage to pull off a wine of utter freshness that is soft, mellow and rounded at the same time. The peachy fruit pervades the entire palate which has just a smidgeon of residual sweetness and a helpful, balancing edge of pleasant bitterness.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer

"This wine is tannic and slightly carbonic on the palate, offering a fresh, spritzy taste. Stemmy, it shows a distinct presence of forest floor, black tea and cranberry flavor.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Thin and weedy, with minty cherry flavors that finish dry and sharp in acids. A decent introductory wine for those new to the variety.",US-California-Pinot Noir

Although the wine is ready to enjoy now, those who can restrain themselves should cellar it through 2022 to see how it further develops.",US-California-Syrah
"The abbey of Marmoutier was founded in the 4th century by Saint Martin. The walled vineyard is owned by the city of Tours, across the Loire from Vouvray.

The overall impression is a little ripe and obvious in its appeals, but it does have a certain fanciness.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"From the oldest part of the estate, planted in 1992, this excellent effort seems to have entered the phase where more aromatic complexity appears. It has lovely delineation of both scents and flavors, a matrix of fruit, soil and Pommard clone. Strong streaks of tobacco and chocolate annotate the core of raspberry puree. The concentration and length are impressive.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

Low acidity makes the structure sort of weak, but drink it now and that may not matter.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"The unusual name (the donkey's back) refers to the shape of this premier cru vineyard which is high up the slope of Meursault. The wine itself, from vines owned by the Leflaive family, is in a rich yet structured style. It has great spice and toast as well as stylish crisp fruits and great acidity.

"A medium-bodied Bordeaux blend with sweet aromas of cherry pie and a hint of fresh sage and tarragon. Simple and straightforward with a ripe, red cherry palate, it's a touch soft with a slight green undertone, but there's nice bright acidity and soft tannins that carry through the finish.",US-New York-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A tremendous wine, this appeals to the senses as well as the intellect. Dry, tart in acidity and somewhat tannic, it shows complex flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, bacon, cinnamon, white pepper and sandalwood. The finish goes on and on.

"A big, rubbery, gaseous nose is not clean, welcoming or lush. That said, this tannic, hard-bodied Tempranillo is pumping savory oak flavors as well as baked blackberry, baking spice and salty notes.

Muscular but in perfect shape, with a finish as smooth as glass.",Spain-Andalucia-Sherry
"A gorgeous Cabernet, and at this price, a bargain. Shows the greatness of the 2005 vintage, with perfectly ripe red and black cherry fruit, sweetly ripe tannins and a fine edge of acidity.

It's enormously complex in flavor, offering notes of fresh summer berry, cola, licorice, dark chocolate and leather that are delicious and savory. It's also a little overripe, which brings raisin and prune notes. It's a great barbecue wine.",US-California-Zinfandel
"In this soft, ripe wine, rounded tropical fruits contrast with the crisp texture. It's fruity while also having a mineral character that suggests the potential for aging. Drink from late 2017.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Very fine, a smooth, silky wine with an elegant mousse, or quality of bubbles. It's pretty full-bodied, with subtle raspberry, peach, vanilla and brioche flavors. Easily the most complex and interesting of Chandon's lineup of sparklers.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Fresh notes of nettle, lemon and green pear appear on the nose. These crisp, fresh flavors are even more present on the light but textured palate that offers substance despite the slenderness. Friendly notes of lemon throughout make this restrained Sauvignon Blanc hugely appetizing.",Austria-Südsteiermark-Sauvignon Blanc
"Characteristically perfumed, this Pinot Gris is full bodied with a richness of texture. It is complex on the palate with notes of nuts, spice and an edge of citrus fruit. Age this wine and don't drink before 2016.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris

"An expertly balanced take on this variable grape, this bottling shows tight aromas of wet concrete, scratched Meyer-lemon skin, yellow melon, poached peach, almond and a touch of salted lime. The palate is high and tight, bound by citrusy acidity, slowly revealing sunflower-seed warmth and ripe nectarine flavors.",US-California-Viognier

The flower, green herb, coffee and barrel spice aromas are brooding, while the palate offers bright acids, firm tannins and a spot-on sense of balance.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Alcohol that reaches these levels is often a complexity killer, but not here. This is a stunningly delicious wine, with ripe, powerful and concentrated black fruits. Baking spices, tar, pencil lead, even a whiff of compost all add to the complexity and the depth of flavor is magnificent. This can age at least a decade but is delicious already!",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sometimes Nebbiolo, depending on the ripeness of the fruit at harvest time, trades in its characteristic austerity for softer tones of ripe fruit and dried currant. This shows those plusher fruit tones backed by notes of exotic spice and crushed mineral. The mouthfeel is firm, tart and structured.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"A tasty tang of toasted oak adds a great top note to this full-flavored and full-bodied wine, so that it seems to build complexity from the bass notes of ripe pear, to the butter and cinnamon in the middle and up to the wrapping of spicy, smoky oak.",US-California-Chardonnay
"You'll love the delicate floral fragrances of this feminine, cool-climate northern Italian white. Acacia, jasmine and honeysuckle play a leading role with a supporting cast of stone fruit and pear. In the mouth, it's not particularly intense or thick.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend
"This zesty Provence white is starting to show its age a bit, with faded flowers upfront and a slightly waxy texture. Nonetheless, there's enough to keep the senses entertained, with a pleasant floral edge to the pear-inflected palate and a final butter note. Drink up.",France-Provence-White Blend
"With an opulent texture, this is ripe and packed with yellow fruits. There is just a hint of the wood aging along with great acidity and citrus flavors. Although full-bodied, the wine finishes crisply fresh.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"Tar and rich black cherries form the nose of this wine sourced from a vineyard planted in 1997. Luscious red fruit begins the palate, supported in the midpalate and finish by black pepper and fennel seed. It makes for a very approachable but complex, spice-driven wine.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"From a vineyard atop the Cuesta Grade, this atypical yet awesome blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petite Sirah, 5% Petit Verdot and 2% Malbec shows blackberries, beef char, pencil lead, coffee beans and a touch of dried dill on the nose. Though flavors are still unfolding, there's plenty of blueberry, violet, lavender, soy, dried strawberry and night jasmine on the palate.",US-California-Red Blend
"Spicy, heady aromas are dark and draw you in. This value CS is solid and ripe, with good mouthfeel. Loamy, oaky flavors of black fruits are standard but tasty, while blatant oak and related chocolate and peppery notes drive the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This value-minded wine from an iconic producer offers attractive initial scents of brambly berry and cherry, with additional touches of marzipan and vanilla that lend decadence. The medium-weight palate shows great balance, with ample acidity and firm yet fine tannins that frame the bright red-fruit flavors. Drink now–2018.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Pinotage

"This is an extreme example of an extreme varietal. The color is black except for a thin purple rim. The aromas are like dark chocolate and subdued blueberry.

"Complex aromas of coffee, black pepper and wild herbs like rosemary and thyme get this five-grape blend off to a fine start.

Finishes with a wave of red fruit flavor but also tough, grabby, lasting tannins. Drink now through 2013.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Red Blend

"The aromas of flowers, herb, cedar, game and plum are appealing. The flavors are light and fresh, with snappy tart acidity livening things up.",US-Washington-Cabernet Franc

"With a soft, heavy mouthfeel and hot, candied raspberry and cherry flavors, this Reserve Pinot is a disappointment. It's okay, but tastes like a simple little Pinot Noir for drinking now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This refreshingly balanced, light-on-its-feet wine doesn't hold back in terms of black fruit and subtle richness. The dark currant and cherry highlights are accented with dark chocolate, clove and white pepper notes, the oak quiet and supportive of the overall structure.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of berry and cassis come with a shot of raw oak. This is grabby and puts on the clamps, but spicy, peppery flavors of olive, berry and oak are very good in front of a hard, moderately tannic finish.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This cleanly made Shiraz boasts decent aromas and flavors of blackberries, chocolate and earth, but lacks weight on the palate and shows some heat on the finish.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz

"This offers aromas suggesting cherries marinated in spirits, underbrush and a whiff of camphor while the firm but rather lean palate offers grilled herb, licorice and a note of sour cherry. Astringent tannins grip the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Made in the modern style, this is a simple, sweet Chardonnay, with pineapple and pear jam, buttered toast, honey and vanilla flavors.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Firm, dry tannins behind this wine give a hard edge that will need time. The wine is powered by its structure, solid and only just fruity. Wait until at least 2017 to allow more fruitiness to come through, although the wine will likely always be tough.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Celebrating the first lot—Port—in the first auction held by Michael Broadbent in 1966, this is a reserve style wine, rich and soft with chocolate and ripe berry flavors to go with the sweet texture. There is just a final edge of stalkiness.",Portugal-Port-Port
"A pure varietal Syrah, this opens with a mix of peppery herbs, a hint of stem, and a whiff of tomato leaf.

"The label doesn't tell you, but this is from the Firestone family's Curtis Winery vineyards in the Santa Ynez Valley. It's a very nice wine, especially at this price. A little too sweet, its orange, lime, lemongrass and vanilla flavors are balanced by crisp acidity.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of yellow stone fruit and Spanish broom lead the nose while the juicy palate offers mature yellow peach, citrus, pineapple and a hint of almond. Bright acidity provides balance and a crisp finish.",Italy-Central Italy-Verdicchio

"Named CH (the initials for Switzerland) in honor of the Swiss origins of owner Alice Tavares da Silva, this wine is made from old vines. The wine has concentration and generous tannins that are as bold as the black fruits. It is still very young, still with its young licorice flavors. Drink this wine from 2020.",Portugal-Lisboa-Portuguese Red
"The aromas are tight and nervous with notes of wild berry, ginger and licorice. It is firmly astringent, so give it a few more years to help soften the tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"The merest hint of oak spice wafts from the nose. The palate has that softly oaked, spiced roundedness that adds cinnamon and a touch of vanilla to gentle but not overtly expressed berry notes. There is some tannic grip, too.",France-Alsace-Pinot Noir

"Heady aromas of honeysuckle, peach and herb hint to the complexity of this dry-style Riesling. The palate is ripe and rich with yellow peach and nectarine flavors plus a creamy, mouthfilling texture. Lemon-lime acidity strikes through the finish, leaving the tongue with just a murmur of honey and spice.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"With 11.1% residual sugar, this is a sweet wine, but it's also a little simple. That brown sugar and honey sweetness is delicious, by definition, but the underlying flavors are a little disappointing.",US-California-Gewürztraminer

"An interesting and complex wine, dry and crisp, and unique among California Sauvignon Blancs. Although there's plenty of citrus fruit, it's marked by other things, such as minerals and herbs, and the sweet, olivaceous taste that the variety's Sauvignon nature contributes in a cool vintage.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Lovely aromas of plum, crushed violet, iris and cake spice mingle in the glass. The delicious, smooth palate doles out layers of ripe black cherry, blackberry, white pepper and cinnamon alongside velvety tannins. It's already tempting but will age well for a decade or more. Drink 2017–2027.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese

"Smoky aromas, underbrush, dark berry, clove and a whiff of leather slowly emerge on this structured red. The palate displays power and finesse, delivering juicy wild cherry, white pepper, tobacco, licorice and mineral alongside assertive but refined tannins and fresh acidity. It already has depth but hold for more complexity. Drink 2019–2029.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo

"Soft, dull and vegetal. Still, it's drinkable for some modest cola flavors and velvety mouthfeel.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Quite a distinguished Cabernet. Shows its pedigree in ultra-refined tannins and an overall mouthfeel of lushness and finesse. Flavor-wise, it's all black currants, blueberries and sweet, smoky oak. Thirty-five dollars isn't cheap, but this is as good as it gets in this price bracket.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This savory wine opens with aromas of violet, red rose, wet soil, woodland berries and a whiff of Mediterranean herbs. The fresh, inviting palate doles out juicy dark cherry accented with hints of cracked black pepper, sage and clove.

The concentrated core results in a resonant, clean finish. Not your usual Sauvignon Blanc but one worth trying.",Austria-Südsteiermark-Sauvignon Blanc

"There's a severity of acids and tannins that limits this Pinot's immediate enjoyment. It feels tight and hard, despite a core of black and red cherries and the sweetness of toasty oak. All indications point to the cellar. Give it 6–7 years, and it could be going strong well after 2020.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"From the Laguna Ridge neighborhood of the larger appellation, this is a subtle, fuller-bodied wine that's silky and refined in dark cherry, anise and rich earth. Pomegranate and cassis play in the background, the flavors nuanced and complex, with a tangy, citrus-tinged finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is one of those Viogniers that's flashy and extravagant. If you're a Chardophile, it brings the same creamy, oaky sweetness and lifts it into the stratosphere, with scads of tropical fruits, sweet ripe pears, honeysuckle flowers, vanilla, brown sugared and cinnamon. Viognier hardly gets richer. Drink now.",US-California-Viognier
"Full, fresh and bright Malbec with only the good stuff that has made this variety so popular. The color is lusty, the aromas fruity and clean, and the feel is forward with proper body and acids. Tastes like pure wild raspberry and black cherry, with hints of vanilla and oak. Appealing in every way.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"For this medium-sweet wine, the Grassa family has chosen one of the Southwest's great grape varieties. The Gros Manseng easily makes this style: fruity and with a fine balance between sweetness and crisp acidity. This is a young wine, named after the singing thrush (grive) in the vines. It's still developing and will be better from 2018.",France-Southwest France-Gros Manseng
"This has enormously high alcohol, but the fruit is curiously thin, with some unripeness. The amount of new oak doesn't seem to help.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Light and fruity, this has flavors of creamed apple and ripe Williams pear. The wine is crisp and tangy, and it's shot through with lemon zest and acidity. Ready to drink in one year.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"An herbal-leaning bottling, this shows oregano, pasilla chile and a shred of bell pepper on the nose, giving nuance to the blueberry-fruit base. It's fresh and easy-drinking on the peppery palate, with strawberry cut by more chile elements. It's great for those who enjoy pyrazine influence, but stay away if not.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Faint and restrained notes of rose petal and orange peel make for an inviting scent. On the dry and very slender, almost weightless, palate the power of lemon freshness pervades all and highlights notions of honeysuckle and rose. It's a gentle, fresh, and aromatic wine.",France-Alsace-Muscat
"Elegantly structured, this offers floral, wild berry and spice aromas. The focused palate delivers bright red cherry, crushed raspberry, leather, white pepper and licorice flavors presented with laser-like precision. Chewy but fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework. It's already tempting but it's not fully developed. Drink 2016–2026.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Ripe black cherry and a lick of herbs are wrapped up in a solid structure of balanced acidity and tannins, with a slightly savory finish. The oak is prominent, as is the ripe fruit, but for the price, this is the kind of bargain Shiraz Australia once built its Stateside reputation on.",Australia-Australia Other-Shiraz
"Focused and bright, this northern Italian Pinot Bianco shows intense aromas of stone fruit and white rose. The mouthfeel, however, is what sets it apart thanks to the beautiful balance between its crisp acidity and that touch of sweet softness at the back.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Bianco
"Unlike any other Merlots in the region, this fascinating low-alcohol tribute to a northern Italian style shows oregano, thyme, parsley, rainbow peppercorns, dried purple flowers and a seductive hint of green pepper on the elegantly layered nose. The flavors reflects the nuanced nose, with crushed peppers, just-ripe blackberry, iodine and a touch of greenness.",US-California-Merlot
"Lean and crisp in style, this is citrusy through and through. Although a bit one-dimensional, it's clean and refreshing, with a pleasantly affordable price tag.",Australia-South Australia-Chardonnay
"Aromas of sawdust, toasted oak, espresso and spice lead the nose on this blend of 90% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and Colorino. The palate offers black cherry, mint and eucalyptus notes alongside bracing tannins. Evident oak muffles the juicy, ripe-fruit notes.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Light golden in color, this is exotic in ginger and lemongrass, with a midpalate of fresh-cut pear and wet stone. Gearing up to the finish, expect deeper tones of caramel and tropical oak.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Pea and green bean aromas announce a heavy, somewhat vegetal wine. The mouthfeel is viscous and not easy to navigate, while overly sweet pineapple and mango flavors finish in a mash of banana.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Chardonnay
"Very little of this reserve was produced in 2011. A blend from five vineyards, it spent 10 months in 43% new oak. Firm and a bit steely, it has tight dark fruits anchored in a streak of earth and iron. Give it a few more years in the bottle, or decant if drinking it soon.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"The aromas of woodspice, vanilla and cedar are primary at present on this wine that seems initially closed on the nose. The palate is more vibrant, with cranberry and cherry flavors framed by a tart lick of acidity. Its best days in front of it. Drink after 2021.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A blend of 70% Pinot Nero and 30% Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of toast, roasted nuts, mature apple and pear. The palate offers rich apricot, citrus, bread crust and vanilla alongside a fine, persistent perlage.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Sparkling Blend
"This is a feminine wine, soft, generous and fruity. The raspberry and cherry flavors are jammy. There's some heat on the finish from high alcohol. Drink now.",US-California-Grenache
"Ripe, soft and fruity, this is a black-cherry-flavored wine. It has a good balance between the fruit and the crisp acidity, giving a wine that is both rich and bursting with fruitiness. Drink now.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"This broad, mouthfilling dry Riesling features powerful flavors of baked apple and dried spices, uplifted and amplified by oily, minerally accents. It's just a touch off-dry, balanced on the finish by crisp acids and pronounced minerality.",Germany-Pfalz-Riesling
"Tart and astringent, this young wine shows good structure but remains a bit tight. Light red fruits, a streak of citrus, and a strong base of cement and chalk-like minerality, this has persistence and complexity. It needs more cellar time to fully express itself.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Oak, roasted coffee bean and coconut aromas lead the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry, exotic spice, oak extract and espresso alongside astringent wood tannins that dry out the mouth. There's not quite enough fruit richness to stand up to the oak.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"With its keen acidity and mineral-dominated flavors, this currently tastes a bit austere. It also has a core of orange, apricot and mango flavors that are sweetened by oak. Don't drink it too cold, and allow it to breathe before consuming.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Blowsy and mustardy, like it's starting to turn south. The palate is loud, jumbled and heavy, with mustardy orange flavors, a touch of flowery honey and then bitterness. Big and powerful, but not very poised.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Incò is a blend of Friulano (80%) and Pinot Bianco that opens with a solid, but neutral, bouquet and a creamy feel in the mouth. Pair this structured white with spicy chicken Tandoori.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend
"Bright aromas of plum, herb and abundant wood spices are followed by plump, fresh dark fruit and barrel flavors backed by a light grip of gritty tannins.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"From a cool Forestville vineyard once devoted to apples, Appian Way is rich in Goldridge soils, providing a happy home to these grapes that offer a core of pomegranate and cranberry, laced in black tea. Light bodied without being wimpy, the wine is complex and velvety, finishing in nutmeg and ginger.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The winery calls this a Super-Tuscan blend, though the inclusion of 38% Carmenère might have some Italian vintners scratching their heads. The rest is mostly Sangiovese, with bits of Syrah and Cabernet as well. Juicy citrus and purple berries, some pomegranate and dark chocolate can be found, along with the green bean, stemmy flavors of Carmenère.",US-Oregon-Red Blend
"Earthy aromas of tilled soil, bell pepper, ripe plum and a whiff of barnyard waft out of the glass. The palate is a bit rustic, displaying fig, ground black pepper, graphite and a gamey note alongside velvety tannins. Drink soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Syrah
"This single-parcel, partially barrel-fermented Champagne is in effect a Blanc de Noirs. If all that sounds complicated (and so does the name of the wine), the wine itself is much easier to appreciate. It is certainly rich, with a touch of tannin and mineral texture. Full of ripe white fruits, it offers good acidity at the end. It could age longer; drink from 2017.",France-Champagne-Pinot Noir
"Baked boysenberries, purple flowers and baking spice show on the nose of this widely available bottling. The palate is quite minerally, with crushed lava rocks, followed by cooked elderberry, black-cherry pie and a touch of clove.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sharp, chewy and aggressively tannic, this simply refuses to emerge from its tannic shell. The stiffly herbal flavors dominate, while any ripe fruit seems to be in hiding at the moment, despite lengthy aeration.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This wine is sourced from two parcels, one planted in the 1930s and the other in the 1950s. The low dosage is possible because of the concentration and ripeness of the fruit, resulting in a sophisticated, balanced and rich wine with a lemon zest flavor, a tight, mineral texture, and a crisp finish.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot starts out with aromas of dark coffee, toast, blackberry, fresh herbs and barrel spices (53% new French). It pulls no punches with rich blackberry and cherry flavors.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Dry and crisp in acidity, this has pleasant raspberry, rose, tobacco and spice flavors. Try pairing this with salty, cured meats, like ham and sausage.",US-California-Rosé
"Clean, tart and expressive, this has flavors of Asian pear, orange, lime, vanilla and gooseberry. Bright and zesty, this would make for a fine apéritif, and it would also pair well with Asian fare.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
This simple wine holds somewhat oxidized aromas of caramelized orange slices and flint that carry over to the palate along with lemon-lime.,Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Inzolia
"Wiry, slightly grassy aromas of raspberry and plum come with a touch of oaky vanilla. This Malbec feels downright hard and choppy due to tough gritty tannins. Plum and berry flavors come in blips rather than a harmonious whole, and this tastes of lactic oak and rubber on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A marshmallow-kissed Sauvignon Blanc with a touch of grass and tropical lime, this is a straightforward white that finishes quick and is wanting in texture.",US-California-Fumé Blanc
"Full, ripe and so tannic in its present form that it's scratchy and hard on the mouth. Aromas of ripe berry and syrup hint at its core power, while flavors of blackberry, fresh raisin and chocolate are true and good. A powerpacked wine with a fierce mouthfeel; only time can bring it around. Hold until 2011.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Round, ripe and quite pretty cherry fruit flavors, showing a hint of loam and a briny note. Tannins have smoothed out, and the length is better than average. Score could improve with further bottle age.",US-Washington-Syrah
"The earthy intensity of herbaceous Sauvignon leaps out of the glass, giving a wine that's concentrated with citrus and green herbs. It's crisp at the end, with a hint of thyme that gives a peppery aftertaste.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"This Bordeaux variety more often than not produces a light, fruity wine of charm and early drinkability. Here, the sour cherry fruit is framed in dry, dusty tannins and soft acids. There's an elegance and spicy aftertaste that are very nice. —S.H.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"Extra fruity, packed with strawberry and crisp red currants flavors, this is all freshness, richness and clean acidity. It has some weight but this just emphasizes the fruitiness.",France-Provence-Rosé
"A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc and 20% Merlot and Sangiovese, this forward wine offers sweet black cherry, red currant, black pepper, toasted oak and espresso sensations. The ripe palate finishes on a note of drying tannins. Drink soon.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"An attractive silver-pink colored wine, this is beautifully ripe and fruity. It has a great balance between acidity and raspberry fruit. There is a herbal edge that gives the wine a fine tangy character. Drink this wine from the end of 2017.",France-Provence-Rosé
"A basic, light-bodied red, this has earthy and raspberrylike aromas, a firmly tart and slightly tannic texture and lean fruit flavors like cranberry. Its tangy and appetizing mouthfeel is the best attribute.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A vibrant pink hue in the glass, this rosé has nice ripe fruit aromas of wild strawberry and fresh cherry that follow through to the juicy, red fruit-dominating mouth. Round and full, the rich mouth could use a bit more cut.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rosé
"Earthy notes of slightly bruised, ripe apple peel set the tone of this wine. The palate is taut and clean, shot through with zesty, refreshing lemon juice and peel notes. It has a light-footed elegance and a dry, clean-cut finish.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Petit Verdot is normally a blending grape, but with this bottling, Stryker has produced a very interesting and very good wine. Like a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, it's dark, full bodied and tannic, filled with blackberry purée, dark chocolate and toast flavors. Delicious now, and should age well for many years.",US-California-Petit Verdot
"In its early stages of evolution, this wine offers mainly stoniness, firm acidity and a hard- edged structure. Of course it will soften, but this will likely remain a tannic wine, the fruit always edged with acidity, for many years. It is potentially a great wine that just needs patience.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Mature and with swathes of ripe fruit, this is a concentrated wine. Tannins give a firm core to the velvet-textured blackberry fruits. Richness and a sense of power are aided by the spice, pepper and dry aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Clove, mint, raw oak and black-fruit aromas are forward and scratchy. In the mouth, this is on the syrupy, rich side, while the flavor profile runs sweet, with hints of savory BBQ sauce and resin. A candied tasting finish is short and chunky in feel.",Spain-Levante-Monastrell
"Made from a typical Gascon blend of Colombard, Sauvignon Blanc and Gros Manseng, this zesty wine is dry, herbaceous, fresh and crisp. Its full of citrus and green apple fruits, with a tangy finish. Screwcap.",France-France Other-White Blend
"94–96. Barrel sample. Big and ripe, this is a powerful wine with 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, giving the wine a solid, dusty structure but also delicious fruit. Finishes with a touch of chocolate at the end.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A sleek mix of tart berry, stem and herb, along with a hint of oak and chocolate, this is a fair value in a widely available, drink-now Oregon Pinot. The wine oak-aged for six months, whether in neutral or re-staved is not indicated.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Hogue's Late Harvest Riesling is an odd duck. In most usage, late harvest indicates a dessert-style wine with considerable sweetness. Here it seems more like a mass-market, tasting room wine. It's simple, off-dry, and a little papery in the finish.",US-Washington-Riesling
"This is Gainey's basic '05 Pinot, and it shows the quality of the vintage. The wine is dry, crisp in acidity and under 14% in alcohol, with dramatic cherry and boysenberry fruit complexed with leather, cola, Chinese five spice and balsamic notes. Fairly tannic, it's best now and for a few years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This well-integrated wine is full of black plums and stylish tannins. The structure is all there, giving firm tannins as well as richness. It is already a beautiful wine, ripe, solid and with excellent potential. Drink from 2026.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Ripe with a core of dry tannins, this is a typical foursquare Nuits-Saint-Georges. Structure gives shape to the black fruits and acidity that are developing well. Already in balance, it will be drinkable from 2016.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Petrol and citrus aromas and flavors merge seamlessly in this medium-bodied dry Riesling. It seems atypically round for such a young Eden Valley Riesling, so maybe not a long-term proposition, but it goes down easily now, with a long, slightly oily finish.",Australia-South Australia-Riesling
"Closed and firm, this wine has considerable structure, tannic and steely together. It's a forbidding wine at this stage, although it will develop much greater fruitiness and freshness as it ages. Under the structure, the wine has apple skin, hints of apricots and green pear flavors. The end brings in spice from the wood aging. Drink from 2019.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Shy in the glass, this wine needs more time in bottle to unravel its complexities of rose petal and cardamom, flanked by crisp red cherry and raspberry. Tangy acidity is the star and backbone of the lovely, structured wine, which is delightful now, but worth cellaring through 2023.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Concentrated, bright and focused fruit flavors feel shaped by a moderate oak influence in this full-bodied and nicely structured wine. A good amount of tannin wraps the raspberry and blackberry flavors in a firm texture.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Delicate and fresh, this tastes like a pure-blooded Riesling. It has lively acidity, crisp apple flavor, a light perfume, and a refreshing character. Drink now. Screwcap.",Austria-Kremstal-Riesling
"This 100% Syrah from sunny coastal Tuscany offers extreme softness and richness with chocolate, cherry liqueur, blueberry and smoked bacon fat. Pair this rich wine with game meat or stew.",Italy-Tuscany-Syrah
"Quietly, Hewitt flies below the radar, often producing Cabernets that, while not cheap, rival their pricier competition. Consider their '09 a deal. It's dry, smoothly tannic and complex, offering waves of black cherry jam, mocha, licorice and smoky oak. You can drink this lovely wine now, but it should develop in the bottle over the next 10 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Brambly cherry fruit carries a generous amount of vanilla and clove highlights, along with a lightly smoky aroma of Earl Grey tea. Such details bring the wine to a deliciously satisfying finish.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This portion of the winery's vineyard always yields Cabernets of enormous concentration with hard tannins. The 2009 is a classic, detonating in the mouth with laserlike blackberry and cassis flavors, to which new oak brings additional richness of smoky cedar. It's really a beautiful wine, but very tannic, even by Von Strasser standards. Give it at least eight years, and it could be drinking well 20 years from now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
This blend of the local white grapes has been given a herbal twist with Sauvignon Blanc. It is fruity and still young with its lively acidity and crisp texture. Drink from the end of 2017.,Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese White
"Aromas of rose, violet, perfumed berry and a whiff of leather lead the nose. The bright, accessible palate doles out juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and a hint of star anise while supple tannins provide the framework.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"This is a ripe and soft blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon. Well balanced, it has rich, spicy fruit lifted by lemon and apple flavors and by the final acidity. It's ready to drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Dark in color, this accessible wine is deliciously layered and focused, offering a core of golden pear, Gravenstein apple and nutmeg, with a bright laser beam of acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This bold and full-bodied wine has fragrant fruit aromas and oodles of berry flavor, plus a firm texture created by ample fine-grained tannins and supportive acidity. What makes it special is how the grippy texture wraps around the opulent blackberry and boysenberry flavors for great balance and a sense that it will age well through 2022.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This is the winery's inaugural vintage of this wine, which blends Birch Creek Grenache (57%) and Mourvèdre (14%) with estate Syrah. The aromas pop, with notes of stargazer lilies, dried tobacco, white pepper and red fruit that lead to soft, silky, very pretty fruit flavors.",US-Washington-G-S-M
"Lush and generous, this has a center of blackberry fruit, showing barrel accents of sweet baking spices. Notes of graphite and clean earth round out the finish.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"98-100 Barrel sample. Sumptuous, opulent, with gorgeous ripe fruit, and yet under 14 percent alcohol. The firm tannins are almost smothered by the delicious fruits. It is a great wine that expresses both the natural exuberance of Palmer and the rich fruit and balancing freshness of the vintage.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Pale in color, this rosé is soft and gentle. It has caramel and spice flavors that give a piquancy to the smooth, rounded red fruits. The aftertaste is just as soft.",France-France Other-Rosé
"While the name means “burnt,” it really refers to the southern exposure of this warm vineyard. Wood aged in new barrels, this wine has a toasty character that is well balanced by the rich fruits. Acidity and a mineral texture give this wine aging potential. Drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"At the southern end of Nuits Saint-Georges, this vineyard produces a ripe and full style of wine. This wine has those characters along with the tannins and the acidity of the vintage to produced a juicy wine that will age well. The aftertaste keeps that crunchy, crisp character. Drink it from 2019.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Initial charred aromas turn to licorice and black fruit on the nose. A rigid structure of fierce tannins provide strength to toasty, spicy berry flavors on the palate. Vanilla, herb and mocha tones combine with textural dryness on the finish. Drink though 2025.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Made with late-ripened grapes (85% Vermentino and 15% Viognier), this has aromas suggesting beeswax, pressed yellow flower and a whiff of honey. The aromas carry over to the round palate along with suggestions of apricot and nectarine.",Italy-Tuscany-White Blend
"A 100% varietal wine, this features big oak and dry tannins around a rustic core of full-bodied black cherry and dried plum. Savory tobacco and tea provide a sultry edge to the proceedings, before tartness comes to bear on the finish. Enjoy now through 2018.",US-California-Sangiovese
"Seems already mature, with truffle and mushroom notes creeping in among the apricot and orange marmalade fruit. Soft and lush, with just enough tannin and spice in support for near-term drinking.",France-Rhône Valley-Viognier
"Plum and raspberry aromas are wiry in nature and “red” in character. The wine feels healthy and not overly heavy, with roasted, slightly herbal flavors of berry fruits and creamy oak. A spicy, lightly herbal finish ends this Malbec-Syrah-Merlot blend in solid fashion. Drink through 2015.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Red Blend
"Citrus and gooseberry define the all-fruit nose. In the mouth, you'll encounter the full allotment of cantaloupe, citrus and green herbs, particularly basil. The tangy finish is like grapefruit sorbet after a nice meal; it cleanses the palate, leaving no residue at all. It's refined, racy and tips the scale at just the right weight.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Feels heavy and ponderous now, almost like a common Grenache, and might age, but it's a gamble. Made in a particular style of extreme ripeness, the wine features blackberries, currants, red licorice and spices, and is fully dry.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This shows dark berry aromas with hints of toast and sandalwood. The palate delivers black fruits layered with licorice, spice and espresso, but it's a bit shy on length.",Italy-Tuscany-Red Blend
"Plum, sassafras and dark cherry form a contingency of flavor in this brooding, velvety smooth wine with a sizable finish. Cinnamon and clove are peppered throughout this full-bodied, well-made effort from the famous vineyard site.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"With some weight behind it, this is a rounded wine, lightly flavored with apricot and lemon and a tang of bitter orange zest. The acidity is soft, an easy element in the texture.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Based on Merlot, this Right Bank-style Bordeaux blend has rich, instantly likeable flavors of cherries, currants, cocoa, green olives and violets. New oak plays a prominent role, both in toasty flavors and in wood tannins. The wine feels softly tannic in the mouth, and will be fabulous now with a great steak, but it also will develop over the next 10–12 years.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of dried fruit and barrel spice lead to tart, slightly dilute seeming fruit flavors backed by lightly gritty tannins. It seems a bit evolved for its age.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"The tannins are really nice on this red blend. They're smooth and ripe and feel just fine in the mouth, and they frame luscious flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate, cola, leather and peppery spices. The finish is a bit sweet, but it's an elegantly constructed wine for drinking now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"Bright, soft and attractively fruity, this is an easy, open wine. An edge of acidity and minerality give the wine a good, crisp texture. Drink now.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Good, solid fruit flavors fill out this light-colored but full-bodied Grenache. It has ripe plum, tart cherry and cedar nuances; a broad, firm texture helps flavors linger on the finish. It's the kind of wine that tastes better with each sip.",US-California-Grenache
"Big wood, big fruit—there are no half measures here. The wine is spicy from the tannins and wood, the fruit is densely black with red berry tinges, and the power is evident throughout. This wine has weight.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a heavily oaked brew of 50% Viognier, 40% Chardonnay and 10% Riesling. The nose is woody to the max, with herbal notes of parsley and white flowers. A full, heavy, resiny palate is home to barrel-driven flavors of spice and clouded white fruits. On the finish, this tastes mostly of wood and resin.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-White Blend
"Estancia produces solid, savory Pinot Grigios at a fair price, and they even dropped their price last year. This one's a little off-dry, with crisp acidity and pleasant citrus, peach and honeysuckle flavors.",US-California-Pinot Grigio
"This is a pretty Pinot that's light and silky on the palate, and comforting in its moderate alcohol and spicy, exotic flavors. It offers waves of wild forest berry pie, baking spice, sweet-and-sour persimmon and sandalwood flavors that are intriguingly complex. Absolutely delightful now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Subdued floral notes signal a restrained Gewurztraminer. The palate has ample freshness and gentle perfume, making for a subtle wine that plays down the fragrances but boosts the spiciness. It finishes fresh and wonderfully peppery.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
"Dry and crisp but unripe, with vegetal flavors beside the modest cherries and currants. Drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is everything a Valpolicella should be: fresh, savory and incredibly easy to drink. Made with organically grown Corvina and Rondinella, it offers aromas and flavors of cherry, crushed raspberry and a sprinkling of baking spice alongside pliant tannins. Drink soon.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Not at all shy, this bold, brash wine will be great to drink with equally bold food. A very dark color and a tempting aroma like grilled baguette slices leads to big, powerful berry flavors, full body, high alcohol, thick but soft tannins and a smoky, meaty finish.",US-California-Syrah
"This wine is 61% Syrah and 39% Mourvèdre. Appealing aromas of red and black fruit, mineral, spice, earth and braised meat lead to a full bodied, still quite tightly wound palate. All the stuffing is there but it needs some additional time in bottle or a short decant to open up.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Deeply funky aromas of salted rhubarb and beets, grilled meats, anise and hot tar greet the nose on this fascinating Pinot Noir. Sanguine, bloody flavors evolve down a line of licorice and slate toward raspberry, with a bit of grilled meat at the very end.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Another fine Cabernet from Prime, following a great 2009. This '10 is perhaps a little off pace from the prior vintage, but is nonetheless impressive. Dry and smoothly tannic, it shows complicated blackberry, blueberry, black currant, sage and mineral flavors. Give it at least six years in a good cellar.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Young, fruity and with potential, this is a perfumed while also structured wine. It has plenty of black-currant flavors as well as delicious acidity. The dry core keeps the fruitiness together. Drink from 2019.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A great value wine from Sicily present on restaurant lists across southern Italy, La Segreta is a famously food-friendly red blend that offers light berry, cherry, almond and spice aromas. The easy mouthfeel pairs with pasta, risotto, veal or roast chicken.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Red Blend
"Juicy black cherry and black berry take center stage in this blend of Montelpulciano and Sangiovese. There's a hint of white pepper and mint on the close, along with just enough freshness to lift this up. Not for cellaring, so enjoy soon. Worldwide Cellars, Sussex Wine Merchants.",Italy-Central Italy-Red Blend
"A whiff of volatility brightens up the aromas of this ripe Merlot. The structure is tight and compact, and the acidity is substantial. Clean fruit flavors of red and black berries can be found, but this is a year in which all of the Fielding Hills wines would benefit from a bit more bottle age to knit together.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Chunky and oily on the nose, with basic white fruit aromas of peach and apple. The palate is full and balanced, with nectarine, pineapple and lychee flavors. Pithy and citrusy on the finish. Ripe and good in a regular way.",Argentina-Other-Torrontés
"Here's a watery and thinly extracted Pinot Grigio that delivers measured aromas of citrus, honey and passion fruit. This is the kind of easygoing wine you'll want to share at park picnics.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"The nose is a mere promise compared to the full-on experience that follows. The dry palate is a lovely synthesis of ripe, textured and tart elements: of russet-pear peel and flesh, of grapefruit zestiness and spice, of ripe and aromatic tangerine. This is concentrated and full of flavor, animated and full of impact. This seems like energizing fuel. Mouthwatering freshness creates a long fruit-rich driven finish.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"This is 100% Pommard clone, bright and spicy in the nose. The fruit flavors are sharp and penetrating, with brambly berries and a touch of pine sap.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"Blackberry, earth and spice aromas prove that a bouquet can be complete with only a few ingredients. This feels rugged and tannic. Flavors of coconut, buttery oak and toast support berries fruit. This is choppy and pounds its way through the finish. Drink through 2021.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"A lightly funky whiff of the chicken yard underlies the aromatics, but for most tasters it will be an asset, as it does not block the pretty cherry fruit. These forward, appealing cherry flavors, matched to natural acidity and lengthened with that whiff of funk, make for a delicious and value-priced effort.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Light and perfumed, this is a structured, well-crafted wine that's slightly savage in approach and sensibility. Spicy cinnamon and cola streak through red cherry and strawberry, flirting with the notion of forest and mushroom without ever diving overly deep.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"The wine launched cinematically by Robert Redford in “Indecent Proposal,” this delivers a succulently memorable and seductive mix of crisp cassis and meaty rare beef, a sanguine underpinning that gives it intrigue. Full bodied and ripely crafted, it is completely satisfying in its classical components of sage and cedar, with a lingering lust of chocolate-covered cherry.",US-California-Merlot
"Shows its Right Bank roots in Merlot and Cab Franc-derived red fruit and herb flavors: strawberry, tomato and rhubarb. Turns leathery and earthy, with some hints of toast on the finish.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"There's quite a bit of oak on this wine, in the way of smoky, ashy toast and dill notes. Lees aging adds richer winemaker complications of cream and sourdough. With lemon, lime, nectarine and peach flavors, it's dryishly sweet, soft and easy to drink now.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of black raspberry, black cherry and a cinnamon spice are laid across a slate-driven minerality on the nose of this bottling. It's plush on the sip, with hibiscus and raspberry notes, lifted by pepper, camphor and white sage elements.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"So ripe and beautiful in fruit and oak, so balanced in tannins and acids, that it's hard to know whether to enjoy this Cab now or age it. Right now, it's elaborate in blackberry, cherry, currant and new oak flavors, wrapped into insanely fine tannins. But it's also balanced enough to develop bottle complexity over the next 10 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A little soft, but the spices make up for that, creating a tingly mouthfeel of pepper, anise and clove. That's in addition to the ripe wild blackberry, cherry and mulberry flavors, finished with a splash of tabasco. Great with teriyaki beef or pork.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Dusty berry aromas blend with mint and herbal notes. This Tempranillo feels grabby and pinched; flavors of baked black fruits, vanilla and dill are earthy on the finish, which is chunky but generally balanced.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Abundant cherry notes show on the nose and palate of this wine—red, black and very ripe. It's juicy, fresh and straight-forward, with lovely, peppery spice. A picnic wine par excellence.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Zweigelt
"Fully ripe and very aromatic yellow plum notes make for a welcoming nose. The ripeness intensifies on the palate where it is joined by fresh, pervasive lemon acidity. This is rounded and fresh at the same time and has the mileage to develop. The slightly phenolic hit lends more structure to the aftertaste. Drink 2015–2018.",Austria-Wachau-Riesling
"The brand name is a reference to the winemaker, George Elworthy, being married to the considerably more renowned winemaker, Jules Taylor. George's wine is a bargain compared to most Pinots on the market, offering ample cherry fruit backed by vanilla and herb notes. It's supple and medium bodied, with a soft, inviting finish. Drink now.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Pinot Noir
"From a vineyard atop Pritchard Hill, this wine delivers big, bold flavors and structure. Integrated tannins form around flavors of cloves, baking spices and dried herbs. Blackberry and black cherry pop in between a flinty, earthy side. Drink through 2022.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
Whiffs of sea breeze and oyster shells waft throughout this brisk unoaked Chardonnay. Crisp apple and lemon flavors are delicate in concentration but pristine and refreshing. Drink now through 2019.,US-New York-Chardonnay
"Owing perhaps to its youth,this remains an uneasy mix of acid, oak, apple and citrus. It has strong components that are not entirely integrated. Another year or two in bottle would be a good idea.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
A closed nose gives little away of the conifer and pine notes that seem to spice this wine. It has aromas of oak and some cinnamon but fruit never makes it to the fore.,France-Alsace-Pinot Noir
"Produced from organically grown grapes, this wine is full of fragrant, clean red-fruit flavors. It is ripe and full bodied—perhaps too full-bodied for a really fresh rosé. It does have all the fruit, generous and with a soft aftertaste.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Brooding aromas of purple fruit, apple and spice are followed by brawny dark fruit flavors. The tannins bring a firm squeeze.",US-Washington-Petite Sirah
"There's a surprising element of power to this Pinot Noir. Intense in dark cherry cola, clove and nutmeg, it offers a pronounced finish of wintery cardamom and caramel. The body is medium weight and the tannins smooth and silky.",US-California-Pinot Noir
This is a very attractive rosato from coastal Tuscany that opens with a pale pink color and delicate aromas of rose petal and wild berry. There's a touch of sour cherry on the close.,Italy-Tuscany-Rosato
"Smooth and rich while remaining structured, this wine performs the role of second wine very well. The tannins are already rounded and the black currant fruit remains fresh. It should be ready to drink in 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A 100% Alvarinho wine grown outside its classic area in the north of Vinho Verde, this one earns the Minho regional designation. This wine is in a light style, fruity with green plums and tangy with orange peel. Drink now.",Portugal-Minho-Alvarinho
"This is essentially a southern Oregon blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah, with the unusual addition of 15% Dundee Hills Pinot Noir. It is difficult not to think that the winery just had an extra few barrels of Pinot around and decided to blend it in; the wine is a diffuse mix of generic red fruits and sharp acids, that thins out quickly in the finish.",US-Oregon-Red Blend
"Heady raisiny aromas smell sweet, savory and a bit like animal fur. This is pinching and hot on the palate, which shouldn't surprise at 15.5% abv. Savory roasted blackberry and baking-spice flavors end with peppery heat and hard tannins. Drink this sizzling varietal Monastrell through 2023.",Spain-Levante-Monastrell
"This is a concentrated yet delightfully light-footed elixir of fruit and flowers. Intensely perfumed, it wafts of sweet cantaloupe, honey and pollen. The palate balances lush white peach and hibiscus nectars against a scintillating backdrop of acidity. It's persistent and steely on the finish.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Dense, dark and lush, an extracted wine made from very ripe grapes that brim with dark berry and black stone fruit flavors. Big in the mouth, with dense, creamy tannins. Has the exuberance of youth, and best to lay away for a few years to develop further complexity.",US-California-Merlot
"Subtle aromas suggesting ripe black-skinned fruit, pressed blue flower, earth and a balsamic note waft out of the glass. Made with 100% Sangiovese grown according the principles of biodynamic viticulture, the compact full-bodied palate offers black cherry jam, licorice, sage and espresso. Close-grained tannins leave a firm finish.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"Foxy, floral berry and plum aromas include notes of green herbs. A palate with big, rubbery tannins and herbal flavors of spiced berry fruits and cinnamon finishes with abrasive, drying tannins. This blend holds Garnacha Tintorera, Bobal and Tempranillo.",Spain-Levante-Red Blend
"Bridlewood has crafted a very serious Syrah, from a region of Santa Barbara County that excels at this Rhône variety. The wine is fully dry and full-bodied, with rich, dense tannins, but what's notable is the depth of flavor. The blackberries, currants, licorice, cola, mocha and smoky oak flavors are very rich. Drink now and for a few years.",US-California-Syrah
"The bouquet is dense, smoky and rubbery, with powerful meat and berry notes. It shows vitality as well as mild choppiness on the palate, with tobacco, lemon, balsamic vinegar and black fruit flavors. Mildly herbal, it is somewhat creamy and good overall on the finish.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"From young vines, this is a somewhat austere, ungenerous rendering of Pinot Noir. The tannins are a bit drying, offsetting the attractive flavors of cola, plum and fresh minty herbs.",Australia-Victoria-Pinot Noir
"Burnt rubber, roasted generic berry and rooty tobacco aromas define the nose, which sets up a tangy, sharp, angular palate that shows little more than tart, quick cherry and raspberry flavors. Short and light on the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Merlot
"Thin and raw, and slightly sweet, this is not a very satisfying Cab. It tastes like candied blackberry and cherry LifeSavers.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A great wine, much more than only a Champagne, this is impressively rich and ripe, with crisp yellow fruits, spices and layers of toast. It's in an opulent style that is round but also very focused on tight layers of fruit, minerality and final vivid acidity.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"This is on the more herbal side of the Sauvignon Blanc spectrum, showing obvious notes of tomato leaf and boxwood, but there's ample white grapefruit to back up those green elements. This medium-bodied wine finishes long and crisp.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Luscious black cherry and cassis notes are kissed with menthol on this elegantly structured Merlot. It's a wine with wide appeal, balancing juicy, forward fruit with a streak of cranberry acidity and penetrating, yet velvet-textured, tannins.",US-New York-Merlot
"This wine all comes from Oasis Vineyard. The aromas are light, with notes of citrus peel, herb and guava, showing some reduction. The palate is sleekly styled with nervy acids that keep the interest up.",US-Washington-Sauvignon Blanc
"A sweet style of aged tawny, it has rich caramel flavors that combine with sultanas and almonds to give a ripe and generous wine. It has kept plenty of fresh fruitiness while moving towards wood aging.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Lively and tangy, but refreshing as it captures the new Chilean style of racy Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is spritzy, with lime, orange peel and tart apple flavors. Cleansing on the finish. Good value and purity for the money.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Custard and apple pie aromas lead the charge in the bouquet of this decadent wine, accented by notes of roasted nuts and orange essence. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, with just enough acidity to lift the rich fruit, honey and sweet-spice flavors. There's a beautiful evolution to the close, from lifted citrus to ripe fruit and finally sweet spice. Drink now–2019.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Chardonnay
"The current releases from Scarborough show a winemaker dedicated to obtaining excellent fruit and experimenting with an interesting range of barrel sizes and sources. Here it all works well, a Southern Rhône-style mix of Grenache, Mourvèdre, Counoise and Cinsault with a flinty, mineral base note. There's a sweet-tart cherry core and a lick of peppery spice that livens up the finish.",US-Washington-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Pure, focused fruit flavors like raspberry and red cherry light up this medium-bodied wine. A lively texture of crisp acidity and light tannins adds great balance to the effusive fruitiness. For such a friendly price, what else could one ask for?",US-California-Zinfandel
"This offers aromas of tilled soil, black-skinned berry and a whiff of baking spice. The round palate presents vanilla, clove and blackberry jam alongside smooth tannins. Drink through 2019.",Italy-Piedmont-Barbera
"It has been a while since we've reviewed Cuatro Pasos, but eight vintages later it's basically the same wine, which, for the price, means good value. This opens with earthy warm muddled berry aromas. The palate is flush and plump, reflective of a hot vintage, while blackberry and cassis flavors finish hefty. Drink now.",Spain-Northern Spain-Mencía
"The 2007 vintage was generally a great one for Bordeaux-style reds in Stellenbosch, and the Els Signature definitely demonstrates it. Sure, it's ripe and sexy with a lot of sweet oak characteristics like cocoa powder and smoky wood, but it's got the ripe fruit core of black plum and dark forest berries to back it up. Spicy layers of leather, cigar box and black tea leaves add complexity to the palate, while chewy tannins provide a firm structure. A bit young now, so try after 2015.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Dry and light, this is a decidedly elegant wine. It shows an enchanting mix of peach, peanut brittle and lemon flavors in the mouth that wind up in a lovely but fleeting pineapple note. Drink now to 2011.",France-Alsace-Gewürztraminer
Intensely aromatic Williams Christ pear and minerality combine to make a sleek wine that leaves real impact. The palate is concentrated but toned. Fresh grapefruit zest amid ripe apricots makes this wine vivid and refreshing.,Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"The Te Muna Road section of Martinborough is the same region exploited by Craggy Range and Escarpment, so Cobblestone's American owners are in good company. Only the second release of this wine, the 2010 is a plush, sexy example, featuring a combination of fruity and savory components. Black cherry fruit pushes through complex notes of smoke, sous bois and shiitake mushrooms. Drink now–2020.",New Zealand-Martinborough-Pinot Noir
This medium-bodied wine smells light and herbal. It gets deeper and richer on the palate as ripe golden-apple flavors kick in and the texture seems to spread out.,US-California-Chenin Blanc
"High toast and burnt wood are initially off-putting. The tannins in the wine are also on the smoky side. However, there is fruit here, offering some balance in this powerful, dry wine, and giving some blackberry juiciness, which gives relief from the intensity of the wood.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Deep brick-red in color, this wine leads with aromas of stewed black fruits, petrol and green pepper. Flavors of cherry preserves, smoked meat, vanilla and a pop of tart cherry make their way across the palate, encased in silky tannins. The finish is simultaneously cool and bright.",Israel-Judean Hills-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine is powerful and concentrated but sophisticated, too. It offers a medley of ripe fruit, dark spice, mouthfilling texture and age-worthy structure. The color is inky-dark and the aromas cassis-laden, with baking spice and a light smoky accent. The flavors recall dark chocolate and macerated cherries. Best after 2022.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Good price for a brisk, clean and elegant rosé sparkling wine. With a pretty copper color, it offers rich raspberry, strawberry and toast flavors. The finish is dry and honeyed at the same time.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"Medicinal cherry and plum aromas set up a palate with clipped, hard tannins. Forced flavors of oak and carob are more obvious than the wine's plum and cassis notes. Oak dominates the creamy, charred finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Made from 100% Cab Franc, this is a soft, rather one-dimensional wine. It has complex flavors of cherries, red currants, cola, white pepper and herbs, but is short on structure and interest. Drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Franc
"This wine is well balanced, ripe with apricot and white-peach flavors that contrast with the kiwi and grapefruit freshness. A more mineral edge gives texture. This delicious wine will be even better to drink from 2017.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"The spice, green herb, cedar, pepper and purple-fruit aromas are brooding and reserved, with a sprinkling of vanilla rounding it out. The elegant fruit and savory flavors show a fine sense of polish, with puckering tannins supporting it all. The focus is on elegance.",US-Washington-Tempranillo
"Made entirely with Cannonau, this boasts enticing aromas of red berries, dried rose petals and Mediterranean underbrush. The savory robust palate delivers black cherries, raspberries, white pepper and almond alongside fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2023.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Cannonau
"From chalk soil, this wine is textured with tight tannins lying over the red cherry and berry fruits. Not rich, it's more a gentle excursion into Pinot Noir giving freshness as well as that light structure. It offers perfumed acidity at the end.",France-Loire Valley-Pinot Noir
"Raspberry, blackberry and tobacco aromas settle in front of a chewy, round, solidly built palate. Medicinal berry flavors come with notes of rooty spice and resiny oak. A finely oaked finish holds root beer and dark-berry flavors that smoothly fade out. Drink through 2021.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Expensive, but a perfect Pinot Noir to drink now for sheer luxury and decadence. Tastes so good, offering a tapestry of raspberry, cherry, licorice, mocha and sweet, smoky sandalwood. With finely ground tannins and near-perfect coastal acidity, it's addictively likeable. Now–2012.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This smooth, almost soft, medium-bodied wine features tasty blackberry flavors, light tannins and a nice feeling of richness. It has a lot of flavor and an easy-drinking style.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Blue flower, woodland berry, cake spice, menthol and a whisper of vineyard dust come together on the nose while the smooth, juicy, palate doles out ripe red cherry, crushed strawberry, star anise and cinnamon. It's a lovely wine, with polished, enveloping tannins and fresh acidity that provide an elegant, accessible structure.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"There is fine acidity here, black currant fruit and firm tannins. The combination works well, giving fruitiness and structure. The result is a wine with aging potential, freshness and an attractive, juicy aftertaste.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Beautifully Burgundian, this soft, elegant and refined reserve bottling captures pretty black cherry fruit, wraps it in a wreath of sandalwood and sassafras, and lingers temptingly through an extended finish. Delicious already, it has the structure to age for a decade or longer.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Lemon and lime flavors cut through this wine that's crisp with a mineral character. It is packed with acidity, with a touch of wood that fits well into the fruit and texture. It's a beautiful wine, not fat although it will fill out. Drink from 2018.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Juicy, tart and tightly wound, this pure Malbec has a core of wild, brambly berry and light plum. Nicely managed oak aging (28% new) brings in a lick of smoky caramel, clove and coffee. The flavors fall off a little too quickly on the finish.",US-Washington-Malbec
"Aromas of forced oak, plastic and berry fruits don't forecast how tight, shrill and acidic the palate is. Snappy flavors of red plum and red currant teeter on being sour, while acidity is what keeps this cranking through a sharp, oaky finish.",Chile-Curicó Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wood-aged wine is spicy, ripe, packed with rich yellow fruits and finished with acidity. It is beautifully balanced, the spice and toast well integrated with the fruit. Drink this still-young, tangy wine from late 2018.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese White
"With loads of white flower and honey notes, Zagra (100% Grillo) is fresh and clean, with lingering tones of almond skin, jasmine and orange blossom. The finish is crisp and lean.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Grillo
"Aromas of mineral and jammy raspberry are attractive, yet the palate seems a bit metallic and clicky, with hard to penetrate flavors of rooty fruits, vanilla, coconut and cola. Opens with airing to display secondary berry fruit flavors in front of a tough, firm finish. Nice and ripe, and ready to drink.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Quite good, but some vegetal flavors mar this dessert wine, which is very sweet, with 18% residual sugar. Such sweetness is usually enough to satisfy on its own, but despite the apricot, tangerine and vanilla flavors, a stubborn green streak lowers the score.",US-California-Chardonnay
"From a domaine located in Gigondas, this is a profound Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Yes, there's some toasty oak on the nose, but underneath is a big, sturdy core of dark cherries, bay leaf and garrigue. This is a structured wine that's built for the cellar. Drink 2018–2030.",France-Rhône Valley-Rhône-style Red Blend
"There's just a touch of oak on this Chardonnay, enough to give it hints of smoke and buttered toast. The palate is dominated by flavors of tropical fruits, citrus, peaches and green apples, balanced with crisp lime-juice acidity. It's an elegant, dry Chard at a good price.",US-California-Chardonnay
"The alcohol level of nearly 16% is the star, or the villain, of the show. It gives this Zin a hot, peppery mouthfeel, not to mention going to your head. On the other hand, the wine is dry and richly flavored in wild berries and spices, and the tannic quality is very fine.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Firm, dark and finely tannic, this has weight and richness, with a severity that dominates the fruitiness. It's dry and tough, and it's aging potential is questionable.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a particularly successful white Monte Velho. It is rich and creamy, full of ripe apple and refreshing acidity in equal measure. Fruity and fragrant, it is ready to drink and will be delicious this summer.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese White
"This blend works in commingling 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Franc and 4% each of Malbec and Petit Verdot, all from the producer's vineyard. Caramel sparks a richness against which herbal, woody tannins speak. The body expansive and full, and the finish awash in spicy clove.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Jasmine, tropical fruit and yellow stone fruit aromas lift out of the glass. On the rounded palate, tangy acidity accompanies banana, white peach and citrus flavors.",Italy-Lombardy-Turbiana
"There's a very spicy, sassy element to this Amarone by La Giaretta that comes across as mesquite smoke, teriyaki, Spanish cedar and hummus. The wine is tight and taut on the close with a delicate prune-like aftertaste.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"This wine has so much of the structure of the vintage. At the same time, it offers rich fruit, black plum flavors and fragrant acidity. It is powerful and concentrated, needing to age. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Good but a step down from recent vintages. Big and brawny on the nose, with oak-based aromas of shoe polish, chocolate mint chips and mocha. The thick palate is deep, raisiny and chunky, with roasted black fruit flavors touched up by chocolate. Very good and likable, but not as thorough and alluring as it has been. 40% Malbec with 30% each Cabernet and Merlot.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Demonstrating finesse and depth, it discloses a stunning fragrance of pressed rose, iris, berry, leather and truffle. The rich but elegant palate delivers creamy cherry, white pepper and licorice along with supple tannins. This wine already shows great depth but will continue to develop for years.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A finely perfumed wine, touched with wood, Beaujolais in a Burgundy style, structured and with intense acidity. It is packed with firm tannins, surrounded by a lively cherry and rich fruit character.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Too oaky. Vanilla, buttered toast, caramel and sweet oak aromas dominate, and the wine turns sweet and extracted in the mouth. There are some decent blackberry and cherry flavors, but this is a pretty common wine.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Lavishly perfumed with hints of honeysuckle, musk melon and pear, this animated Riesling exhilarates the senses. Juicy and fresh with pristine stone-fruit flavor, it glides effortlessly yet endlessly on the palate. Enjoy now for its gorgeous perfume, but save a few bottles through 2020 to let the stately elegance shine through.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Tasted along with a dozen other single vineyard selections from Ken Wright, this feels a bit thin, but only in relation to a portfolio of astonishing power and depth. Truffle, red berries and sharp acidity combine nicely, though the finish falls away rather quickly.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"A flashy, classy wine, grown in the estate vineyard in the benchlands and hills above Rutherford. Shows lots of sweet, ripe cherry fruit and toasty oak, but has enough of an acid-tannin structure to dry it out for balance. Should hold and develop over the next 6–8 years.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"While there are firm tannins here, the wine also has rich fruit. The two together, allied to the concentration, promise some good aging for a solidly made wine. Fine acidity cuts through in the aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A very good value Carmenère with oak and charred aromas in front of berry, herbs and olive. The body is full and the wine has a nice feel; flavors of blackberry bring herbs, pepper and black olive accents. Toasty and a bit hot on the finsh, but bold and done well.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Carmenère
"The oak (21 months spent in French and American) takes the lead, with aromas of baking spices, green wood and vanilla out in front of cherry. The flavors are sweet, supported by grainy tannins that show some dryness.",US-Washington-Merlot
"Lots of zingy acidity in this Chardonnay, along with ripe, jammy apricot, tangerine and lemon fruit flavors. It's an easy wine at an easy price.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Nothing has quite reached the heights of the original release of this wine, but every version has been solidly made by winemaker Rich Funk of Saviah. This is sleek, firm, with cassis and tart red berries. The balance is fine and the finish is clean and shows just a hint of baking chocolate. It's a justifiably popular bottle and a great summer go-to red.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"Aromas of rooty berry, loamy dark plum and minerally crispness create a fine nose that offers notes of coffee and char as it unfolds. The palate on this Monastrell is widespread and grabby, with baked blackberry, raspberry and plum flavors. Chocolate and spice notes ride high on a comfortable finish. Drink through 2018.",Spain-Levante-Monastrell
"The closest thing in California you can get to a great French Chablis, this is absolutely dry, high in acidity and streamlined. It offers tantalizing citrus rind and peach fruit flavors, with a savory taste of cold minerals. Fans of rich, buttery Chardonnay will find it lean, but if you have a cellar, age it for six years and see how it evolves.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Heavy and stalky smelling, with burnt aromas. The leaden palate is weighty and short on freshness; tastes pithy and stalky, with some nectarine and plum thrown in. Seems to be fading.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Rosé
Aromas of fragrant spring flower and a whiff of pear emerge on this lively sparkler. The invigorating palate shows Rennet apple and citrus alongside crisp acidity and bracing bubbles.,Italy-Veneto-Glera
"This is a rather austere, tough Chardonnay. Bone dry, it's marked by brisk acidity, minerality and citrus flavors, with a touch of apricot that's reminiscent of botrytis.",US-California-Chardonnay
"More of that mountain intensity, with very ripe fruit buttressed with spicy, mineral elements. Brambly, briary, and spicy, leading into a fleshy, round, ripe, soft middle and a long, fruity finish. Good right now.",US-California-Zinfandel
"The smooth oak aging is a major element in the success of this elegant wine. While it has rich, polished black fruits and a strong tannic core, it also has a licorice character. It is now maturing, ready to drink as a serious, complex wine.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese Red
"The third generation of the Laplace family has produced a black-colored, juicy and richly balanced wine. Its black plum and damson fruit is enclosed in young, firm tannins that will gradually soften. It's a dark, dense wine that will be ready to drink by 2020.",France-Southwest France-Tannat
"This is a wood-aged wine that's smooth with rounded and great fruit flavors. The wood is subtle, a hint of spice and no more, allowing the ripe apricot and citrus flavors to show strongly. It is a very fine wine, ready to drink now.",Portugal-Dão-Encruzado
"This ripe, fruity wine has both freshness and a warmer, rounded character. Apricot and fresh white peach fruits are filled out with almond flavors as well as acidity. It's a wine to enjoy now, although it will be better from 2016",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"An earthy underbelly of just-pulled strawberry marks this wine, alongside a medium-bodied firmness and spicy acidity. Velvety on the palate it also possesses a tannic bite and showy oak.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A dark and concentrated sandalwood aroma hits the nose on this bottling from west of Paso, alongside strawberries, red currants, smoked meats and a gravelly rockiness. Licorice, anise and fennel drive the palate, which opens up toward concentrated violets, plum fruit and pencil-lead flavors.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Both crisp and creamy, it's packed with lively citrus and clementine flavors. The wine is light in texture, just tangy and full of acidity at the end. Bring on the shellfish.",France-Loire Valley-Melon
"An intriguing Pinot Noir that shows the possibilities of this cool-climate, southwestern Sonoma region. The wine has been well-oaked, but it's powerful enough to carry that coating of caramel and char, with a massive palate explosion of puréed ripe cherries, red currants and sweet rhubarb pie. Delicious now with decanting, and should do interesting things over the next six years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A majority of Grenache plays lead here, with an accompaniment of 35% Syrah and 12% Mourvedre. Concentrated in a grip of leather, there's further integration of earth and black fruit that stays bright and vibrant on the palate, a medium-bodied coming-together of savory with ripe.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"Still full of tannins, this is a tight strongly textured wine. It is dry, just hinting at black fruits and juicy acidity. It is probably already aged and so will remain a firm wine with fruit flavors in the background.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"More sharp and jumpy than many over-$20 wines from the region, but if you like a more racy, acidic style it may be up your alley. The wine offers blackberry flavors, spice and some herbal notes, while the finish thickens with mushroom and chocolate. A good but sketchy wine with a few loose ends.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Firmly on the rustic side, this Zin is hot and peppery. It's also slightly sweet and sour, with spicy flavors of soy sauce, mashed cherries and blackberries, candied ginger, balsamic vinegar and tabasco. This controversial wine, which hails from a famous old vineyard, will have its fans.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Herbal and tart, this has light red fruits and subtle suggestions of chocolate, hazelnut and almond paste. It was aged in half-neutral, half-new French oak.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Shows the bright acidity and pure fruit of the Santa Rita Hills, with lots of cherry pulp and bitter skin, red licorice and raspberry flavors. It's also moderate in alcohol. There's a troubling note of unripeness that may limit ageability, so drink up.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"It's hard not to jump up and down about the outstanding value represented here, a wine made from Dutton Ranch fruit that's juicy and generous in baked strawberry, earth and rose petals. A grippy structure provides weight around nuanced, spicy cherry-pie flavor and plenty of body to satisfy.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Smoky wood flavors dominate this dense, wood-aged wine. It also has juicy red berry flavors and will be generous and very fine when mature. Drink from 2020.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This bold wine has a very dark color and fresh, concentrated blackberry aromas. Generous berry and black pepper flavors seem to saturate the taste buds, leading to a lingering fruit and spice finish. The texture is almost viscous, as lots of fine tannins add grip. It's the rare wine with no added sulfites.",US-California-Merlot
"Another unique, intriguing and delicious bottling by Ernst Storm, this shows damp garden herbs, wild cranberry fruit, kelpy seashore, light white sage, grain fields, flecks of dill and dried rose buds on the nose. The sizzling palate starts with crushed pencils and then dances through underripe raspberry fruit into fresh herbs, showing a distinct note of hops.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A subdued nose leads to a fresh but also subdued palate, but if you look for the ripe pear notes you will find them. This wine takes time to wake up and breathe but underneath it's an archetypal fresh but rounded Alsace Pinot Blanc.",France-Alsace-Pinot Blanc
"Floral aromas mixed with citrus notes are appealing. This wine feels round but solidified by bright core acidity. Ripe flavors include pineapple, mango and peach. On the finish, lime and tropical notes are good but short.",Spain-Northern Spain-Verdejo
"Massive in structure and very generous in flavor, this wine has light vanilla and nutmeg aromas, but dark and potent blackberry and espresso flavors smothered in a thick layer of fine tannins. There is no denying the wine's richness but it holds everything in a dry, firm texture to achieve great balance. Best to drink from 2018 to 2028.",US-California-Syrah
"This solid and dense wine has firm tannins as well as juicy fruitiness. It is dark, rich and full of black fruits that are cut with intense acidity. It needs to age further, so drink from 2015.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Grilled aromas of fresh asphalt and slightly murky berry fruits improve with airing, as does a full-bodied palate with big tannins. Toasty, spicy flavors of herbal berry and cassis show good complexity but are far from tame. Finishing flavors of chocolate and pepper are dry and woody. Drink through 2027.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Aromas and flavors of fig, earth and mushroom characterize this wine, which is a little soft on the palate and grippy in a leathery texture. Full bodied and quite ripe, it has a juiciness of blackberry and depth of dark chocolate.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This is the best Enemigo Cabernet Franc to date. It's pure, heady, powerful juice with integrated smoky oak and spice aromas. Pure in the mouth, this is dense and full of quality. Blackberry and chocolate flavors are ripe and modern in style, while the finish is full, leathery, a touch salty and savory. Drink through 2019.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Franc
"Here's a bright Pinotage that offers aromas of blackberry and plum, as well as faint hints of dried herb and cured meat. The palate is light and easy drinking, with approachable tannins and a short but clean finish.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Pinotage
"The vineyard source is in the cooler part of the valley. The wine is nicely crisp, giving a refreshingly clean mouthfeel that balances the very rich, extracted pineapples, apricots, pears, green apples and peaches. Lots of new oak adds vanilla, butterscotch and sweet cream.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Aromatically intense, with notes of dried peach, orange cream and vanilla, this blend of Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer and Malvasia aims to push the envelope with its rich, almost-fluffy texture, and its penetrating red-berry, stone-fruit and citrus flavors. The grapes were crushed by foot, and skin contact was employed during fermentation. This is a decadent, unusual, oak-aged orange wine.",US-New York-White Blend
"Aromas of huckleberry, herbs and spice are fresh and focused. The fruit flavors are concentrated, with a supple feel and soft tannins. It displays a good sense of balance.",US-Washington-Merlot
"The aromas of high-toned dried herbs, sage, olive, spice and dark cherry provide allure, with the use of stems apparent. The flavors are supple and polished, showing a deft touch. The finish is lengthy.",US-Washington-Syrah
"A genuine, honest sparkler, this has simple tones of almond paste and lemon soda. The mouthfeel is held steady by foamy cream and bright effervescence.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
Black-cherry fruit and a soft tannic structure give this wine its fruity but firm character. It has plenty of ripe generous fruitiness that is sustained by the acidity and by the solid core of the wine. Drink starting from 2017.,France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Lush and ripe, made in the modern California cult style of flamboyantly sweet blackberries, cassis and chocolate, soft tannins and immediate appeal. Defines richness and opulence, if not complexity. Drink now–2014.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's a menthol-infused sense of chaparral shrubbery on the nose of this bottling from the winery founded in 1969 by golf entrepreneur Ely Callaway. Charred pine leads the palate, with rustic elderberries, chopped herbs of oregano, thyme and rosemary, and lots of leather. It needs quite a bit of time to open up.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Château des Jacques, owned by Burgundy producer Louis Jadot, makes serious wines, such as this Morgon. It's powerful and rich, full of solid black cherry flavors and a strongly mineral structure from granite soil. It's a complex wine that needs to age, so drink from 2017.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"Floral red fruit aromas carry a hint of minerality and garrigue. The palate is lively, with good overall balance. Tastes of ripe red plum, raspberry and vanilla, while the finish is light in weight and quick, but satisfying.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"This wine has that wonderful but hard-to-pin-down Zinfandel essence that's extremely fruity but also uniquely spicy and brambly. It blends together ripe raspberry, creamy vanilla and red cherry on a smooth, nicely viscous and very full-bodied frame that helps the finish linger.",US-California-Zinfandel

"This is a big, lush, juicy wine with grip and a fully-formed body, accented with smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A great deal for the quality, it's well made and deeply satisfying in highlights of coffee, cedar, mocha and blackberry, girded by a firm structure.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This opens with aromas of toast, sage, hazelnut and a hint of eucalyptus. The palate offers sour cherry, strawberry jelly, anise and orange peel alongside assertive tannins that leave a dusty finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Massive fruity extract characterizes this Cabernet. With noble tannins and explosive black currant, cassis and dark chocolate flavors, it defines the modern Napa cult style of soft, delicious complexity. Good to go now, but you're better off holding it for 8–12 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fat fruit, juicy and ripe, brimming with wonderful fruit flavors. The wine is unctuous, sinfully lush, and still balanced with berries and spice and some good toasty oak. Young and hard, but good stuff with a nice life ahead.",US-California-Zinfandel
"The Mark V bottling usually gets the most new oak, but in this light vintage the wood has been kept in check. Tasted prerelease, it blossomed over several hours, similar in style and flavor to the winery's Reserve, possessing fine balance and a pretty red-fruit flavor.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"For the price, this is a pretty good Merlot for drinking now. It's soft and approachable with cherry, blueberry, red currant and oak flavors, along with a sightly sweet finish.",US-California-Merlot
"Good for everyday drinking, this Cabernet has smooth, dusty tannins. The black cherry, tobacco and herb flavors are ready to drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Produced from 10- to 20-year-old vines, this wine is bold and fruity. It has delicious apricot and white peach fruitiness that is cut by intense zesty acidity. Its fruit and crisp texture are still young and the wine will be better from 2018.",France-Loire Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Mint and crushed mineral aromas mix with floral scents and barrel resin to form a solid bouquet. The palate is a touch racy and sharp, and thus there's tartness to the cherry and raspberry flavors. Not sour or underdone, but definitely tilts to the red-fruit side of things.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Simple celebrations with family and friends sometimes call out for a bright sparkling wine that delivers the goods, but is in no way too complex or over the top. This is just such a wine with crisp lines and steady features of lemon and sweet grapefruit.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Cherry aromas are firm and don't evolve much in the glass. This is intense on the palate, with strong acidity that lends tartness to sinewy plum and berry flavors. Minor accents of spice and toast finish with espresso bitterness. Drink through 2020.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo Blend
"Year in and year out, Dolce is one of California's greatest sweet dessert wines, and in 2005, it may stand supreme. It's an impossibly rich wine, mainly because the botrytis mold developed perfectly in this fine vintage. Shows fabulous flavors of apricot purée, vanilla-infused crême brulée, pineapple sorbet and candied ginger, balanced with brilliant acidity. The residual sugar is 12 percent.",US-California-Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc
"Although there was no wood aging, a toasty character gives the wine richness and smooth fruits. Apricot, peach and pear flavors have intensity and ripeness. Drink this wine now and until 2018.",Portugal-Alentejano-Portuguese White
"Honeyed and caramel aromas are followed on the palate by a ripe, rich creamy texture. Yellow fruits are further smoothed by buttery flavors. This is a rounded wine, ready to drink.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"The winery actually released this wine after the 2007, no doubt to give it the extra bottle age needed. Nonetheless, it's still quite tannic, bringing to mind an older style of Howell Mountain Cabernet. It's refreshing to have an ageable alternative to the soft, sweet modern style. Rich in mountain blackberries and sweet currants, this wine should develop over the next decade.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Grown in a highlands plateau between Napa Valley and the Russian River Valley, this shows the varietal's bigtime tannins, but it's lighter in body than you might expect. It's delicious in blackberry, currant, grilled meat and sandalwood flavors. This is one of the more elegant and sophisticated Petite Sirahs of the vintage. It's showing its best now and will continue to drink well over the next few years.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Very soft, perfumed with bright red cherry fruits, this is a lively rosé, light and bright, lilting on the mouth, finishing with mineral acidity. Screw cap.",Portugal-Tejo-Rosé

"This firm, perfumed, dry wine has concentrated spice and raisin flavors. Owned by the group that also owns Taylor Fladgate and Fonseca, Romariz continues to forge its own identity.",Portugal-Port-Port
"Ripe and fruity, this is a simple, easy wine with red berry fruits and soft tannins. It has lively fruitiness that is enjoyable now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Assembled from the best barrels of the vintage, this low-alcohol wine is chewy and forward, with strawberry fruit, cola and a whiff of the chicken yard. It all comes together seamlessly and is immediately drinkable. Best enjoyed now through 2019.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This wine has ripe berry fruits and balanced tannins. Fresh acidity marks the vintage and the wine is lightly textured, with an attractive smoky aftertaste. This is the first vintage for Thierry and Odile Bazin, with help from Jacques Chardat, her twin and owner of other Blaye properties.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Lightly spicy, this soft wine has a zesty tang of orange and bright strawberries that are ripe and gently fruity. The wine is open, ready to drink.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This seriously good Zin shows off its ancient vineyard's terroir as well as Dry Creek's amenability for Zinfandel. Rich and complex, the wine is very spicy, flooding the mouth with creamy flavors of grilled red cherries, red currants, Fig Newton cookies, mocha and even a hint of sweet, char-broiled beefsteak. Now through 2012.",US-California-Zinfandel
"This could be labeled Cabernet Sauvignon; the only other grape is Cab Franc (11%). The vineyard's characteristic lush black cherry fruit is surrounded by even darker components: earth, balsamic, baking chocolate, and espresso. There's an interesting walnut flavor (from the barrels?) and the fruit threads through to the very end of a long finish, supported by firm acids.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"A delightful wine, clean and versatile at the table, that's a cross between a rich Chardonnay and a zesty Pinot Gris. Bone dry, it displays crisp flavors of Meyer lemons, limes, tangerines and pears, enriched with a touch of buttercream and vanilla.",US-California-Pinot Blanc
"Extra Dry, in this case, really means slightly sweet, in the crazy language of sparkling wine. But don't let that stop you from enjoying this blend of Chenin Blanc, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and French Columbard. It's clean, zesty and delightful to drink, with strawberry, lime, orange zest, sourdough bread and vanilla flavors.",US-California-Sparkling Blend
"This wine offers notes of woodspice, butterscotch, coffee and blackberry. The fruit flavors are lighter in style with mouthwatering acids and firm, grippy tannins that need some time or perhaps a big, juicy steak to tame them.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Firm and structured, this is a solid wine, laced with mineral acidity and tight tannins. It has a juicy, blackberry fruit component cutting through the texture. Drink this still young wine from 2014.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"Delicate whiffs of orange blossom and tangerine zest intensify on the palate of this off-dry Riesling. While racy and lithe in body, it penetrates on the palate with juicy white grapefruit and apricot notes.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"This widely available and well-priced appellation blend shows dark aromas of black raspberry, elderberry, wet slate and crushed gravel on the nose. The wine makes a soft entry on the palate, where mulberry meets with Earl Grey tea and a pinch of anise.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Off-dry and minty, with a strong streak of wintergreen, this simple, fruity Riesling offers fruit flavors of green apple and a bit of waxy lemon.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Made in a lighter style, this Pinot comes from the cooler Napa side of the Carneros. It's light- to medium-bodied and dry, with a silky texture and pleasant flavors of cherries, exotic dusty spices and sandalwood. Elegant and moderate in alcohol, it's a wine to drink now.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Despite its youth, this is a soft, round, totally accessible wine with pretty flavors of sassafras, pie cherries and cooked plums. It skirts close to an impression of jam, and almost begs for near-term consumption. Don't hold back.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"Made in the popular style, with flavors of buttered popcorn, toast, honey, pineapple and vanilla. Tastes rather sweet, but brisk acidity helps maintain balance.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This wine pulls off a daring feat: despite palate weight and concentration it has a light, almost delicate, feathery citrus touch and a streamlined, fresh palate. The aromatic expression is just beginning to unfold, promising freshly cut apples and oceans of green and dried spice. This should carry a danger-warning: seriously, deliciously addictive! Beautiful now but it deserves maturing. Drink as of 2016–2017.",Austria-Kamptal-Grüner Veltliner
"Apple, mineral and mild briny aromas are complex and interesting. Firm in body, with cutting acidity, this brut nature is bone dry, with white stone-fruit flavors that lean towards neutral except for a hint of salt. Minerality and cleansing acidity push an air-tight finish.",Spain-Catalonia-Sparkling Blend
"New oak dominates this Chardonnay, along with brisk acidity. Beneath the buttered toast and butterscotch are intensely concentrated tropical fruit flavors. The wine is a little linear now, possibly because the vines are quite young. Give it 2–3 years in the cellar.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Jammy plum and berry aromas are tempered by notes of red fruits and currant. This is vibrant on the palate, with saucy red-plum and currant flavors that aren't overextended. Tomato and dry spice flavors mark the crisp finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Bonarda
"From an estate vineyard high atop the appellation and blended with 9% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc and 5% Malbec, this is a bold, balanced wine made by Julien Fayard. Juicy blackberry and blueberry layer along soft, fine-grain tannins, making an impression on the palate. A creamy richness lingers on the finish, accented by black licorice. Cellar through 2022.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a tight, mineral-driven wine with fresh acidity and a crisp character. Sémillon dominated, it conveys green fruits, bright acidity and a lively, tangy aftertaste. The wine is refreshing, fruity and ready to drink. Nicolas Thienpont and his brothers bought this 16-acre property in 1988.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"92-94 Ripe blackcurrants, powerful fruit, with great acidity and enticing dusty tannins. The wine brings out juicy Merlot flavors, with a more concentrated element.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Baked pear and honeysuckle combine around a floral, perfumy vibe, the wine medium in weight, texture and body. A crisp and lemony finish rounds it out, the wine structured and soft.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This 100% Tempranillo will linger with you for a while, a real thinking wine that takes time to reveal its power. Properly tannic—have a hearty meal at the ready—the St. Amant is structurally sound and yet concentrated with sweet notes of toffee, vanilla and brown sugar on the finish, its dark fruit both subtle and ripe. From the foothills of Amador County on a relatively cool site, the wine is aged in both French and American oak (35% new).",US-California-Tempranillo
There's a lot of barrel influence in this acidic Viognier that finishes with a metallic taste.,US-California-Viognier
"Breathtaking scents of white peach and blossom introduce this pristinely peachy wine. It's invigoratingly fresh, laced by a gossamer fringe of sweetness and vivacious lemon-lime acidity that lingers on and on. Delicately textured yet deeply penetrating.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"From the makers of one of Italy's most popular grappas, this vintage-dated Prosecco offers soothing aromas of peach, lime, white peach and spring flowers.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"Black licorice, raisiny fruit and a little sweaty oak are the name of the game here. Acidity on the palate is searing and tannins are soft, not giving quite enough support. The fruit is on the sour side and the oak a little bitter.",Australia-South Australia-Shiraz
"Despite its modest alcohol level, this bottling speaks of ripe fruit. Lime and bergamot aromas bring a floral element, while the flavors are of tangerine and nectarine. A touch of residual sugar adds roundness to the mouthfeel.",Australia-South Australia-Riesling
"Red and black currants, wild berries and a graphite minerality show on the nose of this attractively priced wine. The palate is a tad sweet, showing dark red fruits.",US-California-Merlot
"This captivating wine treads the line between Rhône and Bordeaux. A splash of Cabernet, though just a fraction of the blend, stands out. The wine has depth and persistence, and the mix of grapes works well, showing brambly red fruits, like a Zin, spice and pepper, like Syrah, and some herbal and leafy tobacco in the finish. Complex, unique and quite appealing.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"It's difficult to find a good California Pinot for under $20, but this bottling pulls it off. The wine is silky, crisp and clean, with delicious raspberry, cherry, oak and spice flavors. It's an affordable wine to introduce a new generation to the joys of Pinot Noir.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This wine comes from a vineyard surrounded by Grand Crus. It delivers a huge, smoky palate that is firm with tannins and dense with structure and fruit. The wine is rich, still shot through with the freshness of the vintage. Black fruits are balanced by the dry core of the wine. It will age well, and should not be drunk before 2022.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Built a little more sturdily than some NZ Pinots, Rockburn's 2007 shows fine intensity and purity of black cherry flavors, allied to hints of mushroom, earth and cola. It's full-bodied, with a long, supple finish. Drink now–2015.",New Zealand-Central Otago-Pinot Noir
"Yalumba generally offers fair value up and down its lineup, and this is a good example at the low end. Wet stone and lime aromas mark the nose, while the palate is pleasantly plump without being overly weighty. Pear and melon notes avoid the vegetal side of Sauvignon Blanc entirely. Drink now.",Australia-South Australia-Sauvignon Blanc
This white blend of Catarratto and Chardonnay from Capo Soprano (a sub-brand of Fazio) offers aromas of stone fruit and yellow flower that are framed by drying mineral tones. The mouthfeel is flat and not particularly exciting and the wine ends crisp but short.,Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-White Blend
"Give this wine credit for the sheer power of its fruit. Swamps the palate with freshly crushed raspberry and cherry flavors, liberally enriched with sweet vanilla and caramelized oak. Other than that, it's a bit soft and one-dimensional, but the score reflects how delicious it is.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This Salice Salentino hits a nice balance between mineral nuances and fruit tones, making for a very food-friendly combination. The wine has a smooth texture with flavors of spice, tea and currant berry.",Italy-Southern Italy-Negroamaro
"With 39% Petit Verdot, this is a rarity in Bordeaux. It is certainly reflected in the dark color of the wine. It has spice and a densely concentrated structure, firm and chunky. There are the Bordeaux tannins and the acidity of 2008, filled out with a bitter chocolate and black berry character.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"From this Calistoga vineyard, a first rate Cabernet, sumptuous and elegant. The fruit straddles an interesting line between herbaceous, green olive notes and riper ones of blackberries. Feels just great in the mouth, plush and sensual. Unquestionably an ager.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Concentrated aromas of licorice, mocha and generic black fruits are low on elegance. This is grabby and strong, with herbal plum and cassis flavors that finish chunkily and deep, with good texture. Expect a saucy, herbal aftertaste.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Intense and nervy, this has high acidity that gives it a mouthwatering quality. It's absolutely dry, with bright cherry-pie and spice flavors. Shows real promise for Marin County Pinot Noir.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Dark pinkish-red, this wine comes from two blocks of the producer's Carneros estate, which are harvested at lower sugar ripeness to offer a dry refreshing experience, which this wine does. This exudes weighty and broad flavors of tangy watermelon, orange and cranberry, with a satisfying grip of power on the finish.",US-California-Rosé
"Extended skin contact lends an amber hue and musky exotic tones to this blend of aromatic Gewürztraminer and Pinot Gris grapes. It's fascinatingly complex, suggesting glimmers of spice and bright apple and pear flavors, baked clay and dark herbs. Brisk acidity lends firm structure to the midpalate. It's a delightful wine that would pair well with everything from trout to pork ribs.",US-New York-White Blend
"The “blanc” in the name refers to the white grapes historically planted in this vineyard. Now the vines are a varied red blend of Syrah, Fer Servadou, Merlot and Duras. Seventh-generation winemaker Jean-Marc Balaran creates a fruity, structured wine that is well-balance. Touches of spice from the wood aging complement the smoothness of the wine with its light, fresh aftertaste. Drink now.",France-Southwest France-Red Blend
"If you have a ¬bottle of this in your cellar, drink it now. The wine still has some fruit flavors backed by roasted almond and spice but there are also barnyard or Band-Aid tones that seem to be taking over.",Italy-Tuscany-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Good acidity and a firm minerality provide the backbone to this citrus and tropical fruit-flavored wine. But it's too sweet, turning cloying after the first sip.",US-California-White Blend
"The oak treatment stands out a little in this wine, imparting a dusty, wood-smoke component as well as plenty of vanilla. The cherry fruit is otherwise nicely presented, with ample weight and a touch of creaminess to the texture.",Australia-Australia Other-Shiraz
"Bright and easy-to-drink, this Sangiovese delivers aromas and flavors of candied cherry, raspberry, Mediterranean herb and white pepper. Supple tannins and fresh acidity support juicy flavors.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A structured wine, rich in both tannins and fruit, this wine gives a solid performance. Its black and red berry fruits are already balanced with the tannins, while the acidity lends a delicious lift. Delicious now, but best to wait until 2015.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Ripe and soft, this is a broad style of white showing a tropical side of Sauvignon and Sémillon fruit flavors. The texture is rich, full in the mouth, the acidity well in balance.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"For years, Foxen has been producing one of the best Chenin Blancs in California, and with this 2009, they have outdone themselves. It's so rich in orange, honeydew and pineapple flavors, it might almost be Chardonnay, except it's drier and more minerally, and there's a wonderful note of dried herbs. Although production was only 575 cases, this wine is worth a special search, especially for sommeliers.",US-California-Chenin Blanc
"Three red-Bordeaux varieties combine in this blend, a soft, supple expression of baked plum with a subtle grip of leather. Texturally medium bodied, it shows an abundance of ripeness on the midpalate before settling into more classic elements of cedar and dried herb.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Structured, dense and packed with black fruits, this is complex wine. Yet with all of its ripeness, it offers a great line of freshness and a smoky wood flavor, with blackberry-like acidity on the finish. Age for five years or more.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"It's risky to suggest aging a California Chardonnay, but you'd do well to stash this away until sometime in 2015. Right now, the wine is all about brisk acidity, oak and fresh, ripe tropical fruit, orange and pear flavors. All those parts need time to come together.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Full-bodied but accessible, this delivers ripe dark cherry, plum, black pepper and clove flavors. Fresh and balanced with polished tannins, it's already drinking well. Drink through 2019.",Italy-Central Italy-Sagrantino
"This blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Carignane sure did get ripe, but it's too fruity and simple, offering little beyond massive blackberry, blueberry, cherry and currant flavors. An only-in- California wine, it's easy to drink now if you need a full-bodied, tannic red.",US-California-Red Blend
"The nose is dominated by spices and herbs, a whiff of violets, fennel and white chocolate. Complex and intriguing, it leads into fruit flavors of plum and cherry, with a hint of alcoholic heat. The wine improved substantially after being open for several hours.",US-Washington-Grenache
"Candied berry aromas lack crispness. This feels hard, with little give and depth to the palate. Burnt toasted berry flavors are hot and fall off on a clumsy finish.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This pleasant Merlot is a little tough and gritty, but it's rich and candied in blackberry and cherry, roasted almond and vanilla flavors. Give it some time to breathe in the glass.",US-California-Merlot
"Densely purple scents of blackberry jam, plum, cola, cherry extract and dried violet syrup overcome the nose on this wine from a property once owned by a famous composer. The flavors are quite jammy, but given complexity by nuances of dark chocolate and espresso beans. Decent acidity and solid tannins will make this last. Drink 2018–2024.",US-California-Tempranillo
"With smoky tannins and tangy acidity, this wine is solid, dense and full of toasty wood. Over this structure, black currant notes are fragrant and attractive. Drink from 2018.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Concentrated, delicious fruit flavors and subtle spiciness make a great combination in this harmonious and full-bodied wine. There is no obvious oak character, but it tastes like a gently barrel-fermented wine that developed hints of cream, nutmeg and honey along with a river of ripe pear and peach.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Still firmly tannic, the wine also promises rich black fruits. It has weight, a solid, firm structure and good balancing acidity. Complex and powerful, it's only spoiled by the show of pepper from the alcohol. Drink from 2016.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"More delicate and dainty in mousse than other bottlings from Château Frank, this blanc de blancs calibrates gossamer layers of pristine apple, pear and citrus flavors against spine-tingling acidity. It's breathlessly vivacious and penetrates long with a touch of sugar cookie crumbles.",US-New York-Chardonnay
This is firm with dry tannins and a concentrated dense texture. It is more about structure than fruit and it is likely to remain dry. The acidity at the end does give a final lift.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Winemaker Kim Crawford has crafted a dark, full-bodied Pinot Noir that could use another year or two of bottle age. The nose is slightly meaty and bacony, while the palate delivers dark flavors of black cherries, plums, cola and baking spices before turning firm on the finish. Drink 2018–2025.",New Zealand-Central Otago-Pinot Noir

"Deep ruby in the glass, this wine offers a bouquet of cassis and strawberry. It is bright at first sip, but chalky tannins quickly make their presence known amidst flavors of black cherry, anise and juniper berry that come to a head in a pleasantly bitter apple-peel finish.",Georgia-Kakheti-Saperavi
"Baked black plum, gingerbread, dried mint, clove-laden cherry pie and a touch of light licorice show on the nose of this rich style of Pinot from the Santa Ynez-based, family-owned winery. The palate starts with rich black-cherry fruit, but then dives into an intriguing wash of thyme, sagebrush and anise, finishing on dried cranberry and pomegranate.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Sangiovese gets a spicy lift from 5% Alicante on this bright, easy drinking wine.

"A delicate salmon pink, this offers light scents and flavors of rose water and strawberries. There's plenty of juicy acidity, and the low alcohol makes it great for sipping chilled in hot weather.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This is not your average power-packed Malbec. Opening scents of meaty, wild berry fruits are feral and interesting, and also quite bold. A layered, deep palate shows purity, black-fruit flavors and oaky additions of chocolate, spice and pepper. A dark, minty, spicy finish is fiery, so drink cautiously through 2023.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Warm, earthy and stewed smelling, but then sharp and tangy and acidic in the mouth. Red fruits are dominant, but there's a persistent scour to the wine that doesn't allow it to get to the next level of quality or ripeness.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Merlot

"Crisp, mineral and tight, this is still a young bottling. It is dry, full of citrus-fruit flavors and with a fine burst of acidity that cuts through the wine. Let this delicious wine settle for a few more months to add more fruit to the texture. Drink from late 2018.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay

With a dry finish, it's drinking very well now, and will soften through 2018.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"There is a distinct phenolic edge on this earthy, lemon-dominated and taut Riesling. Fruit—apart from citrus—is subsumed into an earthy, tense and concentrated palate. This needs more time to relax into itself and should blossom with more bottle age. Drink 2017–2020.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"A color so deep it could be a Pinot Noir, flavors bursting with plum and wild blackberry and a velvety texture make this dry rosé taste more like a red. Bucking the trend toward lightness, it has medium body, a creamy mouthfeel and lingering finish.",US-California-Rosé

"The Audrey Cuvée brings extra richness to the regular Diamond T Estate Chard. It's an enormous wine that has honeyed sweetness.

"Made from three-quarters Merlot and one-eighth each Cabernet Sauvignon and Mourvèdre, this new version of The Spinner seems to be surfing a wave of spicy berry that's about to smash into a wall of chocolate. But it never crashes, instead it just sails on through a gorgeous midpalate into a lingering finish that features caramel and mocha highlights.",US-Washington-Red Blend
"This is a good price for a Cabernet this rich and satisfying. It's dry, tannic and opulent in blackberries, black currants and mocha, with a complex note of green olives. It's fully ready to drink now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Made entirely with Moscato, this has a rather inexpressive nose but the palate delivers dried apricot, grapefruit, citrus zest and marzipan.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Moscato

Two years of maturation in French oak contribute to a long finish marked with sweet tobacco and baking spices.",US-New York-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Here's an intense, slightly oxidized, 80-20 blend of Riesling and Chard that is redolent of apple, pear, pine nut, resin and maple syrup. The wine has loads of personality and complexity and is very unique in a non-commercial way. The word Holbar refers to the acacia wood casks used to age the wine.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-White Blend
"This is a dark, dense wine. It has concentrated tannins that are still dominant. The ripe fruit that is underneath will shortly reveal red berry and red currant freshness.

"The light cherry aromas and flavors with herb accents show a slight candied quality. Decent structure, but overall the wine is a bit narrow and closes with sharp, quite tart cherry fruit. It's youthful, for sure, and perhaps will even out with six to nine months in the bottle.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"This opens with aromas of oak, dried plum, toast, espresso and dark spice. The lean palate offers oak-driven spice and a hint of dried dark-skinned berry, but it doesn't have enough fruit richness to stand up the dominant wood sensations. Astringent tannins give it a palate-drying finish.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Nero d'Avola
"The Niven family's winemaker, Christian Roguenant, teases smoked meats, blackberry paste, dark slate, aromatic red cherries and concentratied hibiscus from the nose of this wine.

"There are expected aromas of ripe blueberry, purple flowers, peppercorns and burnt bacon on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard in the Sta.

"You will want to age this Cabernet—8 or 10 years of development is the only way to allow the hard tannins to begin to melt away, allowing the fabulous core of blackberries, currants and dark chocolate to emerge.

Don't even think of popping the cork before 2018, and it could still be providing pleasure 20 years from now.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon

"This wine may have potential in the years to come, but is still searching for its soul at this young age. Aromas of dried black cherries and strawberries meet with black tea, juniper and a touch of tar on the nose.

It's best to cellar it until 2020, or give it a good long decant.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir

"A warm, toasty wine, maybe with too much wood at the moment, but with proper plump, ripe peach flavors and an edge of apple-skin acidity. The wine needs aging —give it 4–5 years.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
"Satisfying waves of black cherry and cola combine in force in this rich, seductive and juicy vineyard-designate. Made in a full-bodied, robust style, it integrates the firm tannin into a supporting role, finishing in spicy clove.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"From an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria comes this exciting wine. Green and Kalamata olives show on the nose, along with crystallized cherry, juniper, fig, unripe strawberry and Mediterranean spice. It explodes with acidic life on the palate, where underripe cherry and tart strawberry flavors mix with green peppercorns, forest underbrush, wet gravel and thyme.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"From one of the state's most highly regarded vineyards, this boasts beguiling aromas of milk chocolate, plum, barrel spice, vanilla, herb and coffee. Lightly smoky, sensuous fruit and barrel flavors follow, showing more elegance than this often brawny appellation is known for.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Nectarine and fig notes mark the nose, while the palate is mellow and well-ripened, then delivers a refreshing citrusy kick on the long, grapefruit finish. Drink this medium-bodied wine over the next 6–9 months.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"Faint notes of peony and oak play above the red plum fruit, leading to a wonderfully peppery, oak-scented but nonetheless very refreshing red. This is an ambitious rendition of slender, fruity Zweigelt in oak that does justice to the peppery, fresh nature of this variety.",Austria-Carnuntum-Zweigelt
"This is a über aromatic wine with a long list of notes that include orange marmalade, peach, citrus, and drizzled honey. Harvested at 42 brix and retaining a whopping 240 g/L residual sugar, it's supremely rich and sweet with a lingering finish.",US-Idaho-Riesling

"Fresh apples and cream aromas with a tight citrus and mineral edge. The fruit is fresh but, with the attractive ripeness of white currants. Very full in the mouth, very much a wine, suggesting an ability to go with food.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"The aromas of plum, blackberry, vanilla, dried herbs and spice provide intrigue. The blue- and black-fruit flavors are linear in style but deliver enjoyment.",US-Washington-Syrah
"Tilled soil, lead pencil, thyme, iris and wild berry aromas take center stage on this fragrant red. It's vibrant and young, with crushed strawberry, red raspberry cinnamon and white pepper flavors framed in lively acidity and taut youthfully austere tannins. A licorice note closes the finish. Drink 2023–2033.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"A light, subtle nose is followed by simple but elegant Chardonnay flavors and a successful play of oak and acid. The mouthfeel is equally appealing, round and supple. The wine could use more complexity but overall, is enjoyable and will be good with a variety of richer poultry and seafood dishes.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"An action-packed wine, especially considering the price, this is a lighter, fresher style of Zin, with smashed strawberry and boysenberry fruit aromas alongside chipped asphalt and riverstone. Juicy olallieberry and baked cherry show on the sip that is enhanced by a touch of oregano.",US-California-Zinfandel

"Bridgitte and her husband Eric took over her family property in 2009, in 2014 producing a spicy and fruity wine. It has fine tannins and sweet red-berry fruit. The acidity and the balance are just right. Drink this attractive wine from 2018. They donate one percent of their turnover to an environmental charity and are (they say) one of only two wineries in the world who are members of “1% for the planet.”",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Though pale in color, this is a tannic and flavorful wine with an earthy underpinning. Lightly spiced red-fruit flavors unfold and gather strength midpalate. This nicely captures the elegance of Naramata Bench Pinot Noir.",Canada-British Columbia-Pinot Noir

"Yeasty, bready aromas reflect time in the bottle, although for a gran reserva this is still young.

"J Winery goes against the grain of the modern high alcohol, superripe style to produce this bone dry, steely, somewhat austere young Chardonnay. It hits with a smack of acidity and minerals, with an elegant complexity that may challenge those looking for big, fruity Chards. Give it a couple years in the cellar and see how it evolves.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Full bodied and richly textured, this is a terrific value in Barossa Cabernet. And it's no simple fruity concoction, either. Instead, it delivers complex notes of grilled meat, coffee and black olive layered easily over a base of dark plums. Finishes long, velvety and mouthwatering; drink now–2020.",Australia-South Australia-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is an unusual combination of Calera and Pommard clones, from a young vineyard amassing an excellent client list, Harper Voit among them. It's made in a soft, full-bodied, supple style that offers a cagey mix of purple fruits, caramel and chocolate. Tannins are smooth and polished, finishing with a light hint of cannabis.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This wine is softly fruity, not matched with the dry tannic structure. It is juicy, perfumed and with tight acidity. A hint of sweetness throws the fruit off balance.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"With its apricot and ripe pear aromas, this is a full and rounded wine. It has a good balance between acidity and ripe fruit. It is floral, smooth and ready to drink.",Portugal-Tejo-Portuguese White

"A big, balanced, bombastic Montsant made from one-third each of Mazuelo, Garnacha and Syrah. On the bouquet it's the fruit that endears but mocha and vanilla stick out. The flavor profile sees lemony oak, blackberry, blueberry and minerality. Spicy and long late with size and grip. Drink now through 2015.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"As its name implies, this wine comes from chalk soil, giving both a strongly mineral character and ripe tropical fruit flavors. It's rich, full in the mouth, dry but with such a ripe character there seems to be some sweetness. It's impressively full and ready to drink now.",France-Alsace-Riesling
"Dry, schisty aromas of cherry and spice are reserved and elevated. This is a bright wine with juicy acidity and complexity. Flavors of baked berry fruits are minerally at the core, while the finish is smooth, mature and steady, with lasting purity. Drink through 2019.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Named after the barn owl (Tyto alba) that nests in the woods of the Lezirias estate, this has great tannins that give shape to the dense black fruits. With a powerful structure and so much of the Touriga Nacional perfumes, this is a wine for aging. Drink from 2018.",Portugal-Tejo-Touriga Nacional
"Vanilla, green wood and dark fruit aromas lead to sweet black currant and baking spice flavors. The wood is somewhat prominent at times but it still provides a lot of appeal.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The very hot vintage took its toll on this 100% varietal Syrah. While it's nicely dry, with a finely tannic structure, it tastes a bit soft and hot. The cherry and blackberry flavors have a dessicated, raisiny edge. Drink now.",US-California-Syrah
"Earthy aromas recall truffle, underbrush, game and ripe plum accented with espresso. The palate offers spicy plum, dried blackberry, dried sage and licorice alongside massively astringent tannins.",Italy-Central Italy-Sagrantino

"This has fragrances of dark cherry, moist soil and spice. The palate offers ripe black-fruit flavors, along with white pepper and baking spice accents. Pair this with salami or pot roast.",Italy-Veneto-Red Blend
"Off-dry, with sugary flavors of apricots, pears, flowers, vanilla and dusty Asian spices. Crisp acidity provides needed balance. Try with Vietnamese, Thai or Burmese fare.",US-California-Gewürztraminer

"Brawny in blackberry, blueberry and black pepper, with a shake of cinnamon, this is a soft, complex wine with leathery undertones. From steep, volcanic-soiled vines, it's appropriately tannic without being overbearing.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"A concentrated wine that is the epitome of dark, dense Malbec. Spice, tense acidity, black fruits, dark plums and licorice are all present in this impressive, dense wine. The power in this dense wine is very evident, expressed right up front. It should age, so drink from 2017.",France-Southwest France-Malbec
"This is one of the more New Zealand-like Sauvignon Blancs out there, and that's a compliment. The wine is thoroughly dry and very crisp in acidity, with a grassy, lemony, minerally profile that makes it savory. Approximately one-fifth was barrel fermented, adding just the right touch of cream and smoke.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"Shows slightly riper characteristics, this has notes of dark fruit, smoked bacon, cola and teriyaki sauce. There's a slight dustiness to the tannins.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Here's a modern, oak-driven Taurasi that puts an emphasis on spice and chocolate aromas, although the black cherry and blackberry preserves are evident in the background. This is a firm, solid and sophisticated wine that would pair with braised lamb in a truffle sauce.",Italy-Southern Italy-Aglianico
"Saucy aromas shadow cassis and plum scents. This feels big and chunky, but the flavors are not fully ripe and are instead slightly green and mulchy. A stewed character spills over onto the finish.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A lighter shade of ruby red in the glass, this wine by young vintner Gavin Chanin—whose original art adorns the label—shows delicate aromas of whole cranberries, shaved fennel and dried tobacco. Pomegranate and cranberry fruits arise on the palate, but pine sap flavors are more prominent, along with licorice and eucalyptus. A strong tannic backbone for such a light wine indicates it will drink amazingly from 2018–2030.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"A warm, ripe vintage of Altano, its berry and red plum fruits rich and generous. It has attractive, well-balanced, soft tannins. A layer of acidity and spice completes this harmonious wine.",Portugal-Douro-Portuguese Red
"Strongly dominated by its wood aging, this is a toasty, licorice and dark-coffee-flavored wine. It does have some black-fruit weight that should allow the wine to balance out. So wait until at least 2019 before drinking.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aroma of lemon zest, acacia, yellow apple and a whiff of almond lead the nose. On the palate, chopped herbs adds interest to pineapple, lime and yellow pear. Vibrant acidity and racy bubbles offset the fruit flavors while a hint of lemon drop backs up the finish.",Italy-Veneto-Glera
"The Hitching Post team of Frank Ostini and Gray Hartley hit a home run on this Highliner, with a nose that features fried shiitake mushrooms, violet and sizzling balsamic vinegar. It boasts an elegant mouthfeel, with very round and widely expressive fruit, characterized by orange peel, olallieberry and more violet.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Pleasant apple, pear and white-flower aromas are accompanied by a slightly earthy, mushroom-like note on this dry Pinot Blanc. It's stark and lean with acidity, savory apple flavors and a brisk finish.",US-New York-Pinot Blanc
"A big, modern, lusty style with dark aromas of cola, chocolate, licorice and immense berry fruit. The palate hits with a wall of tannins, but there's also full-flavored blasts of blackberry, fudge, espresso and licorice. Finishes in form: it's blackened and toasty.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"Gritty, oily matchstick aromas are followed by a blocky palate with apricot, peach pit and citrus flavors. On the finish, a lasting flavor of citrus rind is tough and pithy. Overall this is hard to plow through.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"The aromas are vibrant, with notes of pear, honeysuckle and peach. The palate is full flavored, dry as promised, with a zing of tart acidity that stitches it all together. It's an outstanding value that shows a beautiful sense of balance.",US-Washington-Riesling

"A festive, elegant Pinot for drinking  now with fine fare, such as lamb, steak, salmon or tuna. It's crisp, silky and dry, yet there's a core of ripe raspberry and cherry essence enriched with toasty oak.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"Executed in a ramato style (with a copperish color), this oak-aged Pinot Grigio offers aromas of white cherry and cranberry followed by rose and candied lemon. Crisp acidity helps break apart the wine's creamy texture.",Italy-Veneto-Pinot Grigio
"Herbal aromas of green tobacco, black fruits and coffee grounds require some understanding of Carmenère to fully appreciate. A chunky, saturated palate is thick but balanced by tartaric acidity. Herbal, minty blackberry flavors are woody and show a hint of graphite, while coffee, carob and burnt toast flavors blend with green notes on the finish. Drink through 2020.",Chile-Maule Valley-Carmenère
"This big, powerfully fruity Pinot Noir screams coastal California all the way through. The raspberry, cherry and spice flavors, brightened with acidity, taste of long, warm days and cool nights. It's a good wine, but too young, and would have benefited had the winery held it back a year or so before release. Better into 2012.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This tasty, balanced wine is leaner than some of its peers. Green apple and white peach aromas lead to apple and light citrus flavors. The crisp acidity lines up nicely, making it a versatile partner for food.",US-California-Grenache Blanc
"There's lots of sweetness in this polished wine, with pretty orange, peach, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors. It would benefit from greater acidity, though, as it's a bit soft.",US-California-Riesling
"Notes of caramel apple are juxtaposed with touches of saltwater and dusty mineral in this unusually savory-yet-sweet wine. Lithe and lean on the palate, it finishes briskly.",US-New York-Riesling
"Toasted wheat bread is layered with fresh peaches and honey in this lightweight yet flavorful Chardonnay. Peach and vanilla flavors finish cleanly, marked by a lingering toasty edge.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Chardonnay
"It's a Cabernet-Merlot blend from this highland appellation, inland from Anderson Valley in Mendocino County. The big drawback is excessive acidity. It's harsh and cutting, and interferes with what seem like pleasant blackberry, cherry and currant flavors.",US-California-Red Blend
"This is a lightly honeyed wine with attractive almond and apple fruits. It comes from vines owned by the Saget family since 2002. With final crisp acidity and a tangy texture, it is ready to drink.",France-Loire Valley-Chenin Blanc
"This blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache and Petite Sirah is quite dark in the glass, with blueberry, sharp cedar, clove and vanilla aromas. It coats the palate with soft, lavish tannins, offering zesty black fruit with cappuccino, teriyaki and cracked pepper flavors.",US-California-Red Blend
"This earthy wine is full of firm and dry tannins. It has a dense and dark character, very concentrated along with its red berry fruits and acidity. At five years, it still tastes young and certainly tannic, not moving very far.",France-Southwest France-Malbec-Merlot
"Firm and tannic in structure, this is a wine for aging. Ripe, dark fruits add power and a density of texture. Drink from 2016.",France-Provence-Red Blend

It's quite easy going down, with flavors of cracked pepper, blackberry fruit and a vanilla-licorice combo toward the finish.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Floral, with berry aromas, it's also quite charred and oaky, with mocha. It feels weighty despite displaying prickly acidity, and there's a resiny feel to the palate as well. The flavors of baking spice, chocolate and blackberry run aside barrel-driven flavors. This is a big, oaky Garnacha.",Spain-Northern Spain-Garnacha
"A sound red wine that, at this price, proves its worth as a versatile, satisfying table companion to all sorts of foods calling for a full-bodied red. A blend of Syrah and Grenache, it's dry and tannic, with pleasant cherry, berry, herb and spice flavors.",US-California-Rhône-style Red Blend
"This is another fine Pinot from Cambria, showing the winery's great price-quality ratio. Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices. It's bone dry, and also quite tannic, but you can enjoy it now with big, rich lamb and beef dishes, or a wild mushroom risotto. Otherwise, it will continue to improve for at least eight years.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Not quite ripe, with green, vegetal notes suggesting asparagus. This was a cool vintage, and the wine is from a cool area.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"An appealing wine with notes of dark fruit and sweet spices. It's broad in feel with the dry, grippy tannins the only thing holding it back.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A ripe style of wine, typified by its caramel element and full, spicy fruit. With its weight, it should pair well with food.",France-Provence-Rosé
"Aromas of char and toast are quite up front, though they smooth out over time and give way to lemon meringue. The tropical fruit, butter and spice flavors are broad and well balanced, with a creamy feel and a lingering finish. The oak gets out front, but there are good things going on.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
Beautiful fragrances of white spring flowers and yellow fruits lead off. The juicy palate offers lemon and pink grapefruit accented with mineral and aromatic herbs.,Italy-Southern Italy-Fiano
"Not quite ripe, with a green, vegetal streak cutting through the thin flavors of cherries. It's a soft, simple country wine.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"A fine, elegant wine, with balanced toast and acidity, great ripe apricot flavors along with spice from the toast, acidity, citrus and a hint of ginger. Still very young, this pure fruited wine could age over 6–10 years.",France-Burgundy-Chardonnay
This soft wine shows gentle Chardonnay flavors. Toast and yellow fruits are blended with minerality to give a ripe texture that doesn't need to age.,France-Burgundy-Chardonnay

"Ripe peach and citrus blossom pervade over a delicate honeycomb aroma. Lush nectarine and tart tropical fruit give way on the palate, with crushed stone providing much needed tension. This medium-dry Riesling would be best enjoyed as an apéritif.",US-Michigan-Riesling
"Stern, almost severe initially, this great wine takes time to show its immense fruit power. Black currant and blackberry notes are packed into the wine, along with an impressive array of spices from new wood that gives a more exotic element. At the end, though, it has a fine, structured sense of proportion. Obviously for aging over decades,  so don't drink before 2022.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This appealing wine offers threads of pine needle, sage and parsley, augmenting a clean core of apple and white peach fruit. The complexity is compelling, and the length impressive, though it fades just a little too much to stand up to long term aging.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"This wine is a blend of fruit from the Bacchus (57%), Dionysus (22%) and Olsen (21%) vineyards. The aromas are vibrant, with notes of lime zest, white peach, apple and mineral, along with whiffs of reduction. It drinks dry, with a sleek high-acid styling. Stone-fruit flavors linger on the finish. Pair it with food to see it at its best.",US-Washington-Riesling
"Full, rich and fruity, this is a ripe wine. It is finely poised between this richness and a more delicate, fruity character, lively and bright. Age for a few months, although you can drink the wine now.",France-Provence-Rosé
"This is the third separate cuvée of Grüner Veltliner from Reustle, and given the name (which means emerald), it's clearly meant to be modeled after the Austrian style. For those who relish a crisp, mineral-driven wine, with ripe fruit flavors of Meyer lemon, green apple and pink grapefruit, this rings all those bells and more. The length and definition are most impressive.",US-Oregon-Grüner Veltliner
"Given only 25% new oak, this is a very light, thin and foresty version of the variety, combining funky earth and savory cardamom-type spice with bright, tart red fruit that veers more pomegranate than cherry.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Coming from the cool 2011 vintage this wine offers a blue-fruit profile seldom seen in the state for this variety along with notes of chocolate and coffee. It's elegantly styled with a soft feel, trailing toward the finish.",US-Washington-Merlot
"From a cool, well-known site in the new appellation, this wine offers a complexity of coconut macaroon, clove and cinnamon. Well-formed flavors and aromas accent a moderate level of acidity and tannin, providing elegant balance.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The black-cherry fruit on the nose of this wine is a little sour, lifted by coffee grinds and incense. The tip of the sip is ripe with blueberry, then hardens around stiff tannins and zingy acidity, finishing on smoke and crushed herbs.",US-California-Merlot
"A spicy, floral nose leads this fresh white from Mantinia. Balanced with fruity pear and lemon flavors, it's a good everyday white with a glamorous edge.",Greece-Mantinia-Moschofilero
"Nice on the nose, with mineral, crushed herbs and blackberry. The palate is equally good, with rich plum, cassis and blackberry flavors. This wine touches up against the high class with its rich mouthfeel and overall poise. Easy to recommend given its price. Imported by Atlanta Improvement Co.",Chile-Colchagua Valley-Malbec
"The vintage was generally a good one in Napa Valley, and with this '09, Cardinale shows its usual sumptuousness. It's beautiful and elegant, with hard, chewy tannins framing intensely concentrated blackberries and cassis. Blended from various vineyards by winemaker Chris Carpenter, the wine is as stylish as Napa Cabernet gets. Full bodied and heady, it should provide good drinking over the next 12 years.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Here's a simple but likeable blend of mainly Cabernet, with some Merlot and Petite Sirah. It's enormously ripe in blackberry jam, currant and spicy licorice flavors. Drink now.",US-California-Red Blend

"This is a smooth, approachable and straightforward wine, unfussy in its offerings of buttery toast and oak, the fruitiness derived entirely from the tropics.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Round, lush and sweet, this may not have the textbook pinpoint crispness of Mosel Riesling, but it does offer mouthfilling pleasure. Apple and citrus or pineapple fruit is wonderfully pure, yet buttressed by solid underpinnings of minerality and a lingering, slightly oily finish. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Germany-Mosel-Saar-Ruwer-Riesling
"Lemon oil and candle wax add interesting nuances to the citrusy, barrel-fermented fruit. There was no malolactic fermentation; it's bone dry and the acids are all natural and smooth. Delicate hints of toast and honeyed almonds bring still more depth and flavor interest to the juicy citrusfruit.",US-Washington-Viognier
"This is a big-boned and soft wine with pleasing characteristics of blackberry, vanilla wafer and upfront baking spice. The tannins are well-managed and integrated, with a touch of sweet heat on the finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"A lifted ethereal note of dried hay flowers hits you first. This is followed by generously ripe but very purely drawn fruit: Conference pear, star fruit and white currant. There is concentration on the palate, coupled with a pervasive citric freshness that almost lends this an exotic aspect. You simply want to savor and take another sip. An edge of pleasant bitterness corrals the fruit admirably. The finish is dry, lasting and intriguing.",France-Alsace-Pinot Gris
"The wine is a velvet glove in an iron fist. The smooth surface of ripe fruits and rich blackberry flavors, masks the dense tannins that will allow this very great wine to age for many, many years. The acidity and the rich fruit combine with the fine dusty tannins. The wine will surely not be ready to drink before 2027.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Not as dark and sticky as many wines of this variety; the nose is defined by cherry and raspberry along with barnyard and animal hide. At first the palate seems sharp and acidic, but with time it settles on fuller, more creamy cherry and raspberry along with mocha. Narrow on the finish but fresh and forward.",Chile-Maipo Valley-Carmenère
"Made from Cinsault grapes, this is a reductive, salty and somewhat intense wine at first, that settles nicely into developed flavors of ripe strawberry, peach and vanilla. With substantive weight and breadth, it offers a pleasing texture and body without ever getting bogged down. This is a fine wine for the table.",US-California-Rosé
"The aromas and flavors of this wine are not too intense, with soft suggestions of strawberry hull and ripe banana. Surprisingly weighty and round in the mouth.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rosé
"This is a structured, full-bodied wine that has solid tannins and concentrated fruitiness. It is packed with red-berry flavors, ripe tannins and spice from the wood aging. The wine will take time to develop. Drink from 2022.",France-Burgundy-Pinot Noir
"Here's a very elegant and ethereal expression of Nebbiolo with measured aromatic accents of drying mineral, wild berries and Indian spice. This is a delicate and feminine wine with freshness, tartness and a very fine quality of tannin.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Aromas of hawthorn, acacia flower and stone fruit take shape in the glass. The linear palate offers crisp apple, juicy pear and bitter almond alongside tangy acidity.",Italy-Veneto-White Blend
"Made by Leonor Freitas in the family winery, this is a rich blend of Castelão, Touriga Nacional and Syrah. With its firm tannins balanced by juicy red fruit, it's a wine to savor from early 2018.",Portugal-Península de Setúbal-Portuguese Red
"From the warm Chiles Valley portion of Napa, this Zin is solidly in the New World, cult Cab style of softness and extreme ripeness. The flavors of milk chocolate flood the mouth, with fruit notes of cherries, currants and plums, as well as a mélange of spices in the finish.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Brilliant acidity, dryness and tangy minerality mark this Chardonnay. The grapes come from the estate vineyard in the cool, southern part of the valley. Shows tangy, steel-tinged flavors of pineapples, oranges and honeysuckle, with an extraordinary richness that finishes dry.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Core aromas of cherry and strawberry come with light details of red flower and coconut. Medium in body, the wine offers vivid acids and fine wispy tannins.",US-Virginia-Cabernet Franc
"Gyles Webb, whose spectacular vineyards drench the slopes of the Simonsberg mountain, was once better known for his great-value Sauvignon Blanc and for his reds. But his Chardonnay is as good as the rest of the range, full of tangy marmalade flavors and a well-judged use of oak, which supports rather than dominates the delicious citrus character of the wine.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Chardonnay
"It seems this Italian venture is starting to hit its stride, turning in a plump, round offering layered with complexity. It starts off sweaty and pungent, then develops more melon and nectarine scents with aeration. Those flavors follow through on the palate, followed by persistent notes of white grapefruit on the finish.",New Zealand-Marlborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"More tannic than in past vintages, Bella's '06 Belle Canyon shows the same briary, brambly flavors, with spicy wild berries and olive tapenade accented with fresh green sage, black pepper and rosemary. Drink this exuberant Zin soon, with spicy grilled meats.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Sourced from 50 year-old vines, this is a concentrated wine with acidity a defining partner to the white fruit and citrus layers. A touch of sweetness gives it richness and softens the intense acidity. Worth aging for four years and more.",Austria-Niederösterreich-Riesling
"A whiff of cellar floor, camphor and grilled herb aromas lead the nose while the tightly wound, no-frills palate offers red cherry, pomegranate and white pepper. Assertive, close-grained tannins provide the framework while a hint of grilled sage closes the finish.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Big, ripe and delicious, this is packed with spice and sweet apricot fruits. It's full and opulent, very much a wine of 2009, yet it retains its sense of balance and structure.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style White Blend
"Pungent and nettle-y, but those elements are nicely counterbalanced by a medium-bodied core of pineapple and fig. Finishes pleasantly soft; easy to drink.",New Zealand-Martinborough-Sauvignon Blanc
"This deep-colored, full-bodied red gets a little swagger in its step from enticing smoky oak aromas and powerful black-fruit flavors that also carry that spicy oak streak. This is brash enough for slow-cooked barbecue but sophisticated enough for osso buco. The texture is fine-grained from supportive tannin, and the finish lingers. Best now through 2018.",US-California-Malbec
"This is hard to appreciate now because the fruit is so primary and upfront—like a heaping spoon of black raspberry jam—and also because the tannins are thick and tough. There's something almost rustic about it. On the other hand, six years or more in the cellar could reward. Made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, with a splash of Petit Verdot.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aged at the estate for five years before release, this wine shows fine toasty character paired with youthful mineral texture. It's dry and crisp with apple fruit, edged with a more mature yeasty note. This fine Champagne is ready to drink.",France-Champagne-Chardonnay
"This wine's barrel spice, licorice, cranberry and cherry aromas are high toned. The palate is broad, with generous fruit flavors that taper toward the finish.",US-Washington-Merlot
"This 50-50 blend of Grenache and Syrah has yielded a medium-bodied, pale coppery rosé. It's dry and refreshing, hinting at red currants, pink grapefruit and melon. Drink now.",France-Rhône Valley-Rosé
"A soft, perfumed wine, it shows attractive light black currant flavors as well as some tannins, acidity and a young fruity character. It is ready to drink now.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Ripe borderline raisiny aromas include earth, cedar and graphite scents. This is concentrated, grabby and fully extracted. Flavors of jammy black fruits blend with spicy saucy notes prior to a finish with flavors of tomato, herbs, salt and gamy meat. Firm acidity guarantees this will last at least another five years before falling off.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"Robust and full-bodied, this wine shows Petite Sirah's black currant and pepper flavors in a softly tannic way that makes it fully drinkable now. It's great with barbecue and stews.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"White flowers, nectarine, red apple and a steely minerality greet the nose on this entry-level wine from Rajat Parr. A bright and racy acidity frames the energetic palate that shows delicate flavors of yellow apples, lemon juice and honeysuckle.",US-California-Chardonnay
"An ultra-dry, solid Merlot, filled with hard tannins and zingy acidity. Deep down under are some pretty good black cherry and cedar flavors. Your gamble is to cellar it, as it's just too tough to enjoy now.",US-California-Merlot
"Herb, wood spice, coffee and cherry aromas are followed by broad and generous black-fruit flavors. The tannins provide some grip and need time to settle in.",US-Washington-Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's a decent wine here, crisp and ripe in pineapple flavor, but it's been buried under so much oak, it's practically invisible. The wine reeks of woodsap and charred barrels, dominated by a sweet vanilla taste.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Grapes from Ciel du Cheval, Champoux and Dineen contribute to this attractive Bordeaux-style blend. Cassis and black cherry fruit are combined in a smooth, supple wine with generous coffee and licorice components.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Despite an official alcohol level of 14.2% by volume, this Cab is so hot and overripe, it tastes like brandy. It's all about raisins, oranges, oak and acidity.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Here's a good, rich Cabernet for drinking now. It satisfies for the elaborate layers of blackberries, cherries and plums, enhanced with spicy, smoky oak. Full-bodied and tannic, it shows lots of elegant complexity for the price.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Merlot makes up just under two-thirds of this wine, with the rest Cabernet Franc. The aromas display a medley of fresh green herbs and flowers and cherry, while the palate brings poised cherry flavors that show elegance and persistence.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Oak influence shows strongly on this wine, giving a smooth texture and soft tannins. It has a light texture, fresh with black currant fruitiness attractively balanced with acidity. For the medium term, the wine should be drunk from 2015.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Richly textured and bursting with fresh yellow peach, nectarine and melon flavors, this is an elegant wine with wide appeal. Just slightly off dry in style, it's balanced by fresh acidity and a subtle mineral undertone. The finish lingers nicely. Drink now through 2019.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Fresh-pressed blackberry, cedar, dark-chocolate shavings, charcoal and espresso grounds show on this slightly wound up, extremely dark wine. Coffee flavors come through strongly on the thick and sticky palate, where powerful acidity unleashes blueberries and dried herbs. It's a mouthful for certain.",US-California-Petite Sirah
"Barolo Badarina deserves praise for the intensity of its aromas and the fine quality of its mouthfeel. Bold oak tones of spice and toasted hazelnut will soon fall to the back of the wine's bright fruit and cola flavors. Give it time, patience and drink after 2018.",Italy-Piedmont-Nebbiolo
"Hints of overripe peach and mealy apple indicate a rich, ripe style of rosé, but are immediately followed by accents of green melon, plum and menthol, adding balance and tension. Medium weight, with ample acidity that keeps the ripe fruit flavors balanced and refreshing through the finish.",France-Languedoc-Roussillon-Rosé
"Dry and balanced, this is a great food wine, with its crunchy acidity and minerality. A combination of Roussanne, Grenache Blanc and Piquepol, it shows nuanced flavors of the zests of Meyer lemons and limes, figs and green melons. Robert Hall is producing some of the most interesting white wines in Paso Robles.",US-California-Rhône-style White Blend
"There's a natural essence to this wine, exhibiting the best qualities of the grape as well as a sense of terroir. Soft herbal and mineral accent the clean, fruity core. Green pear, melon rind and a hint of peach pit unfold on the palate and follow through to the long, slightly spiced finish. Perfectly drinkable now, but will cellar nicely for another 3-5 years.",South Africa-Stellenbosch-Chenin Blanc
"The nose on this easygoing Riesling is a bit reserved, suggesting hints of stone and bramble. It's quite vibrant on the palate though, offering loads of sweet-tart apple and pear flavors bolstered by zesty tangerine acidity. The finish wraps up brisk and clean.",Germany-Mosel-Riesling
"Chunky, oxidized aromas announce a wine that's past its prime. A globular, round mouthfeel lacks definition, while flavors of caramel and oxidized stone fruits finish woody, toasty and bitter.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Chardonnay
"This pink stands out for its Ruby Red grapefruit aromas, backed by touches of orange peel and chalk. The mouthfeel is grippy and energetic, recalling again a grapefruit's juice and pith. A perfect breakfast wine.",US-California-Syrah
"This 100% Merlot could be mistaken at first for Cabernet, so structured and bold it initially appears. Cassis, blackberry, spicy clove and pepper combine effortlessly against a layered concentration of body and weight, finding structure along the way. Drink now through 2021.",US-California-Merlot
"There is a yeasty autolytic touch of brioche that mixes with the vivid red-apple notes of the nose which also has subtle floral overtones. The palate shows a subtle harmony of fresh tart apple, a touch of strawberry and again that tender creamy note of brioche. This lovely elegant sparkler has a very fine fizz and a very refreshing long dry finish.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"This is a celebratory display of the appellation and vintage, a rewarding show of creme brûlée and spicy acidity. Well-integrated and balanced, while undoubtedly ripe, it has mellow oak around tropical mango and juicy apricot and peach.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Superripe, showing a direct, crowd-pleasing appeal with its array of oak-inspired blackberries, cherries, sweet currants and chocolate. The structure is gorgeous Napa, with near-perfect tannins and just-in-time acidity. Shows a juvenile fruity sweetness, but is not particularly subtle now, just all power. The gamble is in the cellar. Try after 2012.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This blend of Rolle, Ugni Blanc and Clairette is bright and tangy. It offers a definite herbal flavor as well as ripe yellow fruits integrated into a texture that is crisp and mineral. The wine is ready to drink.",France-Provence-Provence white blend
"This is a bit mulchy and leathery on the nose, with stalky berry aromas. The heavy palate feels wide, with pointed acidity, bearing soupy flavors of vanilla and cream. It finishes with lots of flavor but a syrupy feel.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"This fascinating medium-bodied wine has a wild streak that first brings rhubarb and forest-floor aromas, then deep dark flavor nuances like mushroom, black cherry and more tangy rhubarb. It has good acidity and fine-grained tannins to support all that complexity. It offers all the complexity one looks for in a Pinot.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Not showing much succulence right now, but firm and sturdy, in keeping with the relatively cool vintage. There's green, minty taste alongside the berry, cherry and anise flavors. Could develop and soften with a year or so in the bottle.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The popular, modern style has dictated the crafting of this wine. It's sweet and delicious in buttered toast, caramel corn and ripe orange and golden mango fruit, brightened with crisp acidity.",US-California-Chardonnay
"This wine saw no oak barrel aging, but it's so rich and satisfyingly clean, it's probably better off not being weighed down by caramel and buttered toast. Brimming with brisk acidity, it shows brilliantly pure citrus fruit, tart gooseberry, Asian pear, green apple, mineral and white pepper flavors. The vineyard is in Green Valley.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"This is a light and fresh wine with soft tannins and appealing red berry fruits. It offers attractive acidity at the end, a balanced wine that is ready to drink.",France-Beaujolais-Gamay
"A 50-50 blend of Pinot Bianco and Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of peach, honey and white rose. The quality of the bubbly perlage is tonic and crisp, but both grape varieties provide the wine with medium structure.",Italy-Veneto-Sparkling Blend
"This new Zin from Livermore Valley-based Dante Robere is from two vineyards, one in Livermore and the other in Brentwood. The fruit is mostly plum, with a trace of wintergreen on the mid-palate but even for Zin the fruit flavors are masked somewhat by the high alcohol; it's for those who like a heavy-hitting wine.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Aromas of bath soap and apple come in front of a creamy, round, oily palate. Honeydew, date and vanilla flavors make for a ripe set of flavors, while toast and caramel notes come up on the finish.",Chile-Leyda Valley-Chardonnay
"Tough in tannins, with an astringent, lockdown quality. That's the iron fist of this wine. The velvet glove is the rich, flamboyant core of blackberries and cassis. Give this young wine at least six years to come around.",US-California-Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's a touch of toasted almond at the start, but then this Grillo revs up in the glass to deliver notes of citrus, stone fruit, crushed stone and lemon tart. The mouthfeel is crisp and simple.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Grillo
"Round, creamy apple aromas open things up. This is melony and soft in feel, with flavors of cider, lemon and lychee. A tropical-leaning finish is solid but suggestive of a wine in decline. Drink immediately.",Spain-Galicia-Albariño
"Color doesn't always mean a lot, but in this case a burnished gold-meets-tan color indicates that this is tired and fading. Aromas of commercial apple juice are sweet but bland. This feels a bit citric but without bounce. The mix of spent lees and cidery flavors finish bready.",Spain-Northern Spain-White Blend
"Made from 100% dried Zibibbo grapes, this classic dessert wine opens with intense raw apricot, date and orange marmalade aromas. It's fresh, full-bodied and elegant on palate, with layers of ripe fig, tangerine zest, chestnut honey and eucalyptus flavors that persist long into the finish.",Italy-Sicily & Sardinia-Zibibbo
"This is a slightly sweet Sauvignon Blanc that's shy on the nose, without much depth or breadth.",US-California-Sauvignon Blanc
"The blend is 50% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 17% Cabernet Franc, aged in 100% new French oak. The only wine from this producer that is a blend, it currently shows an abundance of barrel flavors. The baking spices overpower some of the signature elements that this distinguished vineyard imparts—the mineral, saline, iron and steel notes often found in Ciel's red wines. The fruit remains gorgeously ripe, and with a bit more bottle age those subtle flavors may reappear.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The hue is an elegant peach just starting to blush with pink. The wine is entirely dry, with low alcohol framing intricate flavors of peaches, limes and vanilla, brightened by crisp acidity.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This dry wine is strongly dominated by tannins. It is structured, firm and hard-edged. Without the fresh acidity at the end, it would be a tough proposition.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Lifted notes of ripe, juicy apple are foremost on the nose. They also shine on the palate, where they are countered by a fine, gentle and creamy mousse and lovely freshness. This is beautifully composed, understated, fresh and elegant. The dry finish shines with lemon and echoes long.",France-Alsace-Sparkling Blend
"This edition of Nicolis' base Valpolicella Classico wine shows more heft and greater concentration of cherry fruit. Background tones include mocha, dried mint and candy cough drop.","Italy-Veneto-Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
"Didn't much like the 2005 basic Tempranillo from Vall Sanzo and this twice-as-expensive Ribera Del Duero isn't much better. It starts out heavily gaseous, with aromas of wet clay and roasted fruit. The flavors are herbal and on the fringe of being sour, and there isn't much deftness to the wine.",Spain-Northern Spain-Tempranillo
"In calling this southern Rhône-style blend Bistro Style, the winery means to suggest friends gathered in a nice restaurant, having fun and not being fussy about what's in the bottle. That perfectly describes this dry, soft red wine, with its flavors of blackberries, cherries and cocoa.",US-California-Red Blend
Green pear shimmers with sherbet freshness on the nose. The superslender palate gives more hints of green pear peel and is very easy to drink in a thirst-quenching kind of way. Drink soon.,Austria-Niederösterreich-Grüner Veltliner
"A balanced wine that has both fresh red fruits and some tawny maturity. It has acidity, hints of wood aging and a spirit of freshness. The aftertaste is soft, smooth and toffee-like.",Portugal-Port-Port
"There's a highly stemmy quality to this interesting wine from one of the appellation's multi-generation families. The nose shows funky herbs, papilla chile and raspberry extract, leading into a very spicy, savory palate of marjoram, Indian spices and green olive laid across pungent cranberry fruits. It's a winner for fans of stem inclusion.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"This is a tightly coiled wine, still firm and packed with tannins as well as fruit. It has a strong dry core that is lifted by the bright acidity. This is going to be a very complete wine, all the elements well in place. Drink from 2026.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Like all good passito dessert wines made from the Sagrantino grape, this shows firmness and structure, with aromatic characteristics of bitter chocolate and cherry liqueur.",Italy-Central Italy-Sagrantino
"Decadently ripe, this voluptuous Cabernet Sauvignon brims with fleshy black-plum and berry flavors. Touches of green pepper and stem add a bit of contrast to all the richness, and subtle notes of spice and bramble tones lend complexity as well. Despite its brawn, it's a neatly balanced wine kept in check by crisp cranberry tones and a fine-grained tannin structure.",US-New York-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Ripeness and richness reign over this full-bodied, almost-sweet wine. Oaky, maple-syrup aromas and lots of black cherry and boysenberry flavors partner with a smooth, posh texture. Think of it almost like a Port, but drier and not quite so high in alcohol.",US-California-Zinfandel
"Melis is a project backed by wine industry folks from California, but this blend of old-vines Grenache along with Carignan, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is very European. It's heady but well balanced, with smooth edges and not too much fiery attitude, roughness or scratchy tannins. It's forward and big-boned, but there's enough creamy richness to make it friendly. Needs plenty of air time now; should hold well for five-plus years.",Spain-Catalonia-Red Blend
"Clean and ripe, with apple, pear and zesty citrus aromas. The palate runs more round and candied than linear and sharp, with sweet, welcoming flavors of white peach and dried citrus fruits. Fuller-bodied and inviting, but still fresh. Drink immediately.",Chile-Casablanca Valley-Sauvignon Blanc
"Juicy, tart and crisp with acidity, this is a standout vineyard designate with a bold, velvety texture. Blue fruit-driven, it's full-bodied and fleshy in all the best ways, with a plush finish that teases with cardamom and tea.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"This shows how a wine can be both immediately delicious and drinkable, yet possess that extra stuffing to make it complex and ageable. It offers generous raspberry, cherry, chocolate, vanilla and spice flavors, balanced with gorgeous acidity and a hint of dusty tannins. Drink now–2018.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Ripe and solid, this has dense tannins and a superstructure of opulent red-berry and black currant fruits. The wine is layered with coffee, wood-aging influence and a firm finish. It's big and has great potential.",France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine is 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc, 13% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot and 3% Malbec. Aromas of cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, wood spice, graphite and herb lead to sweet full-bodied plum and coffee flavors. It has a lot of textural appeal, with lightly chalky tannins providing support.",US-Washington-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"The best Grace to date, the wonderfully fruity entry bounces along, offering a punch bowl full of spicy cherries, with extensive highlights. Sniff and taste streaks of clove, coffee, fresh earth and mushroom—all clean and harmonious. This may be drunk immediately with enjoyment, or set aside as your special occasion wine with a decade or more of ageability.",US-Oregon-Pinot Noir
"This structured wine has ripe black fruits followed by red berries. There is a good depth of flavor, the tannins giving the bright fruit weight and a mouthfilling character.",France-Bordeaux-Merlot

"Akin to a lemon drop, this wine offers a richness of fruit and oak along with balance. It conveys a mix of gingersnap, baked apple and lemon meringue, particularly on the finish. Medium to full bodied, it's a layered and complex expression of the variety that's right for the table.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Juicy pineapple, mango and citrus notes lend a tropical feel to this penetrating, yet light bodied, Pinot Gris. Off dry in style, it's dancingly light on its feet, with a revitalizing shower of acidity that lingers through the finish.",US-New York-Pinot Gris
"Ripe notes of apricot and white currant are threaded together with a delicate scent of pineapple. The palate tastes nectarous yet zesty, thanks to the uplifting acidity that gives the wine some pizazz.",US-Virginia-White Blend
"Aged sur lie for 10 months in 100% new French oak, this golden-colored wine leads with aromas of toast, pineapple and peach. The tropical fruit flavors are full bodied and rich with a creamy, almost unctuous feel. It's full-bore but an excellent representation of the style.",US-Washington-Chardonnay
"This is crisp with a steely edge. From a single vineyard, it is a blend that is dominated by Chardonnay, the wine is tight with a texture that suggests it needs to age in the bottle. There is plenty of fruit but it just needs to soften.",France-Champagne-Champagne Blend
"Made in tiny amounts in a light-bodied style, its vineyard site in the cool Petaluma Gap, this wine opens in earthy soapstone and sandalwood, offering an aroma of dried flowers. Delicate acidity supports a funkiness of cranberry, rhubarb and nutmeg, while a suggestion of roses lurks in the background.",US-California-Pinot Noir
This has some simple flavors of sour cherry candy and oak. The structure is overly soft and lacking tension. Drink up.,US-California-Pinot Noir
"The eponymous winemaker of this brand is based in San Francisco, from which, in this bottling, he turns out a stunner. Focused, intense, energetic and yet delicate, the nose is full of just-ripe raspberries, bay leaf, thyme, eucalyptus and chipped slate. A sip reveals crushed herbs galore, from oregano to anise, set against tart pomegranate and red plums. Menthol shows on the finish.",US-California-Pinot Noir

"This is quite a sweet wine, rich and heady in chocolate, blackberry and blueberry jam and caramel flavors. It could be more concentrated, as it's a little thin. The variety is Petite Sirah.",US-California-Port
"This is a dry, tannic and extracted young red wine. Made mainly from Merlot, with 15% Malbec, it has blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate flavors. Feels fancy in the mouth, and might pick up some bottle complexity over the next 3–4 years.",US-California-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Leathery aromas blend well with concentrated black-fruit scents. In the mouth, this value-priced Malbec offers juicy purity and plenty of spunk. Flavors of black fruits, licorice and chocolate maintain a sense of freshness, while the finish offers residual blackberry and cassis flavors.",Argentina-Mendoza Province-Malbec
"With an inviting strawberry sundae nose, this bright pink rosé of Syrah from the longtime organically minded team at Buttonwood is all about summertime hedonism. There's creaminess on the palate, with some apple tartness in the middle and, again, long strawberry elements on the finish. Pair with beef sliders on soft, sweet rolls that are adorned with gourmet condiments and cheeses.",US-California-Rosé
"Dense and concentrated, this has thick, almost jammy blue and purple fruits, with a peppery highlight and an undercurrent of sweet grain. The palate is tight, featuring layers of cassis, ink, anise, coffee and iodine, with an earthy salinity that runs through the finish. The Armada is perhaps a bit less fruity and more austere than the other 2009 Cayuse Syrahs, but is every inch their equal.",US-Oregon-Syrah
This austere wine is almost skeletal in character. It offers plenty of tannins and structure and not much fruit. The wine feels hard and tough.,France-Bordeaux-Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"A terrific Pinot Noir, from a winery compiling a serious track record. Grown on the Napa side of Carneros, the wine shows classic Primo's Hill character, with the blackberry pie, cola, mushu plum and sandalwood flavors accented by a little more acidity than usual. Defined by elegance and complexity, it's an ager, although it's beautiful now right out of the bottle. Should easily develop through 2015.",US-California-Pinot Noir
"Scorched earth, underbrush, cured meat and grilled sage aromas lead the way together with a whiff of new leather. The ripe, juicy palate doles out black raspberry, succulent wild cherry, baking spice and a hint of tobacco. Packed but mature tannins retrain the rich fruit.",Italy-Tuscany-Sangiovese
"A popular and well-distributed Pinot Grigio, this opens with fresh aromas of citrus, cut grass and stone fruit. The mouthfeel is generous, rich and fresh.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"While low in alcohol and austere in dryness, there's a remarkable richness of texture that lends an impression of volume and density on the palate. Brisk notes of lemon and tart tangerine shine brightly, but are juxtaposed by an intensely stony, mineral finish. Drink now through 2020.",Germany-Rheingau-Riesling
"Winemaker Bruno Corneaux keeps a tight grip on alcohol levels, without sacrificing ripeness, flavor or balance. This aromatically compelling wine jumps up with scents of sea breeze, toasted nuts and buttered popcorn. Flavors follow, with apples, vanilla and toast coming to a full-bodied lingering finish. There's ample length and tension to age gracefully for another decade.",US-Oregon-Chardonnay
"Aromas of raspberry, black cherry and a hint of jalapeño lead the way for flavors of black cherry, Dr Pepper, eucalyptus and butterscotch. Despite good acid balance and a bright finish, eucalyptus notes outweigh fruit flavors.",Israel-Galilee-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Soft and sweet, this Merlot has a rustic mouthfeel framing jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and leather. Seems at its best now.",US-California-Merlot
"Dried apple and caramel scents lead the nose of this wine, building toward a bigger presence of tannin and oak and meeting a stony acidity and sour lemon tartness along the way.",US-California-Chardonnay
"Salted peaches, dried apricots, sliced lemons, crushed vanilla beans and oak smoke mark the nose of this wine, sourced from one of the appellation's biggest and oldest vineyards. It's light and crisp on the salty palate, with a fleshy apple flavor, racy acidity and slate-driven minerality.",US-California-Chardonnay

"Cavit's Bottega Vinaia line offers an extremely likeable and creamy wine that will more than satisfy adoring fans of Italian Pinot Grigio. The layered aromas are both opulent and pristine and recall acacia flower, yellow fruit, butterscotch and honey—loads of honey. In the mouth, it is lean and fresh with perky spice on the finish.",Italy-Northeastern Italy-Pinot Grigio
"While the nose is intensely oaky, wafting of dark toast, smoked nuts and spice, the palate of this Chardonnay is surprisingly fresh with crisp apple and pear flavors. It's a rounded, voluptuous wine that neatly balances the richness and complexity of oak against fruit. Drink now through 2021.",US-New York-Chardonnay
"The most successful of Amphora's new Pinots because of its richness and balance. Shows strong, forward flavors of berries, cherries and cola, liberally accented with sandalwood, and brightened with acidity. Yet there are elusive tugs of earthier, mushroomy notes.
