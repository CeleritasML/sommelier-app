"Pronounced aromas of salinity, petrol and toasted oak rise up out of the glass. This wine offers a rich, dense texture accented by fresh apple notes and a slightly petrol finish. This is a wine of intensity and body, although it does carry a bit of alcohol heat on the finish. Pair it with mild pasta dishes, fish or cheese, though, and you won't even notice.",France-Alsace:Pinot Blanc
"Sometimes you stick your nose in a glass of wine and it just smells like Riesling, pure and true. This wine carries vibrant aromas of white blossoms, grapefruit flesh and wet stones. On first sip, it's a harmonious blend of grapefruit, lemon and a bit of apricot that seems to add body in addition to complexity. A wave of acidity wipes the palate clean, allowing mineral and petrol notes to shine through. This is a wine that will only get better over the next few years.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"Petrol and eucalyptus dominate the nose on this, but juicy fruit aromas are present and inviting. Weighty and with a silky ripple, this is an intensely flavored, savory wine. Preserved lemons, bay leaves, wet rocks and petrol hang together in a sophisticated package that ends with firecracker acidity. Both serious and refreshing, this wine is ready to take on just about any meal-pairing situation.",France-Alsace:Riesling
"Heady aromas of clove, cinnamon and peppercorn ride high above the brandy-soaked black cherry core in this hedonistic red. It's full in feel on the palate, with accents of cola, clove and cinnamon framing the plump dark-cherry core. Polished tannins and integrated acidity keep it grounded and bright, making this a great red for those who love rich fruit and oak in tandem.",Italy-Central Italy:Montepulciano
"This spicy red displays aromas of Sichuan peppercorn, blood orange peel and mentholated tobacco on the nose, with a solid core of black cherry and red plum. It's polished and supple on the palate, with smooth tannins and pulsing acidity working in tandem to lend a firm webbing for the plump cherry and plum flavors to shine. Accents of orange peel and purple flowers lend levity, with a savory twang of granite on the close.",Italy-Central Italy:Montepulciano
"This poised, polished red shows rich aromas of red cherry dipped in spirits alongside accents of menthol and tobacco. It's gentle and smooth on the medium-bodied palate, with a pert cherry flavor wrapped in dewy herbs and cigar box accents. Smooth tannins and bright acidity lend a cohesive texture to this red.",Italy-Central Italy:Montepulciano
