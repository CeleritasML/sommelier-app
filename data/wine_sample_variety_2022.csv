"From one of the producer's highest-elevation sites, this wine is perfumed in white pepper and rose petal, beguiling from the start. Fresh acidity punctuates layers of strawberry, cardamom and forest pine, taking on a slate-like texture that evokes minerality and tones of dark tea. Enjoy best from 2029–2034.",US-California:Pinot Noir
"Both powerful and ethereal, this elegant, smoky, sour-cherry-imbued wine fills the palate with tangy, spicy flavors wrapped in grippy tannins and buoyed by nervy acidity.

Best through 2030.",US-California:Pinot Noir

"This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 25% Merlot is smoothly integrated, starting with the nose of cocoa, smoke, toasted nut and rich, dark blackberry jam.

"This tangy but concentrated wine holds its lemon and ginger flavors tightly in crisp acidity, giving it a great sense of balance and a good prospect of improving with time.

"This wine has been given time to mature in bottle and still has years to go. Cedar, pencil shavings, crushed rock and firm tannin accentuate the savory, complex concentration and intensity.

"The Para Grand Tawny is an excellent example of this style as well as an affordable opportunity to try a fortified from this renowned historic estate. Aged an average of 10 years, it's a burnt sugar color, with the beginnings of a green rim, but still looking vibrant. The nose is less nutty and oxidative and more evocative of dusty library books, leather armchairs, baked raisins, molasses, coffee beans and warm spice. In the mouth a lovely acidity cuts through the sweetness. There's burn to the alcohol but stays balanced, the flavors flowing to a long finish. Sip slightly chilled with creme brûlée or tiramisu.",Australia-Australia Other:Red Blends
"De Bortoli's espresso-hued Tawny isn't as well known as its Noble One. Aromas of milky coffee, root beer, raisins and chocolate flow into flavors on the palate, where the alcohol and sweetness are tempered by just enough acidity. It lacks much of the intriguing oxidative character and harmony of other Tawnys, but would be a tasty pairing with a caramel-and-nut based dessert.",Australia-Australia Other:Red Blends
"Inky dark in the glass, this blend of 64% Carignan, 18% Garnacha, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Syrah is rich with cassis, smoky wood and kirsch aromas.

"Light lemon, rusty earth and pink-fleshed fruit aromas show on the nose of this rosé blend of 67% Mourvèdre and 33% Grenache. The palate offers a lightly rocky minerality that cuts through the orange-peel and pluot-flesh flavors.",US-California:Rosé
"Watermelon, strawberry, lime pith and crushed rocks make for a complete rosé nose for this blend of 69% Mourvèdre and 31% Grenache. Rose-petal and pink-fruit flavors pop on the palate, which is wrapped in a steely tension.",US-California:Rosé
"This deep-hued rosé has a bouquet of green apple and strawberry with a dusting of dried hillside herbs. It is full in the mouth, with flavors of tangerine, lemon sorbet, butterscotch and sage.",Spain-Northern Spain:Rosé
"This bottling, which includes a strategic boost of 10% Viognier, begins with fresh and very green aromas of lime peel and freshly mowed lawn. There's a chalky grip to the palate that is vibrant with a spicy acidity and sharp flavors of green apple and grass.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
"Balanced and round, this is a bright and fruity white wine from the producer's estate, brimming in compelling notes of melon and stone fruit. The acidity is measured and consistent.",US-California:Sauvignon Blanc
